Database, Server and Performance Issues

Over the week we spent considerable time working through server, database and SQL‑related performance problems that are directly impacting responsiveness and report generation. Multiple sessions recorded a duplicate of the production database in a separate environment that “explains why everything’s super slow,” and the duplication process “started the process last Thursday.” The environment in use was explicitly identified as running SQL 2019, and compatibility/version history was discussed (references to versions 8.43, 8.4 and 8.1 and a note that the application requires Windows Server 2025 as a base OS were captured verbatim). Attempts to obtain and apply a new SQL port number were underway — Ricky stated he was “waiting for them to give me the new port number” and had followed up that morning. Troubleshooting is constrained by access: it was noted that some personnel “don’t trust me with that,” and that SQL/remote service restarts cause broad workstation impact (a server restart was described as taking “about 1 minute” but forcing every computer to be manually restarted, with typical downtime near “about 20 minutes”).

Because the database and server work are central to many flows (inventory lists, imports, exports and UI responsiveness), the explicit next steps captured in the sessions were to obtain the new SQL port number, verify and document SQL server access rights, and coordinate restarts / port connectivity tests (examples: a proposed quick test to access port 307 and verify the new port). The Wednesday notes recorded a planned server infrastructure overhaul with a new on‑premise server room described as “a whole lot more beefy,” an Oracle database that was to be provisioned, and a stated intent to restore/clean a blank database instance. The consultant and client recorded action items to configure the new Oracle database, plan the server rebuild, obtain the required key and move server‑based reports to the server. These items are operationally high risk because multiple transcript excerpts recorded lost or destroyed custom settings during updates and slow IT responsiveness, and because the duplicate database activity is explicitly tied to system slowness and blocked imports/exports.

Inventory, Receiving, Purchase Orders and Procurement Consolidation

Inventory cleanup and PO finalisation were recurring topics across multiple days. The Tuesday session captured on‑order and backlog figures with specific numeric values: Inventory had previously been “over 1,000,000 lb,” current “Weight on Order = 1,063,145 lb,” and a backlog described as “roughly half a million pounds” with a ±100,000 lb variance. A forecast of an additional 300 tons of steel (explicitly equated elsewhere as ≈600,000 lb) was discussed as incoming on new POs. The transcript noted a large single line‑item figure 241,927 (no unit specified in the transcript) and other inventory counts such as “10,100 fittings” and “40,000 of these.” These inventory values are important because the clean‑up was incomplete — after partial cleanup “the on‑order weight still reflects the same,” indicating reconciliation work remains.

Purchase‑order handling remains Vista‑centric in practice: Vista is the origin point for job numbers and POs, and the sessions explicitly recorded that a Vista PO number must exist before estimates or POs are loaded into Tekla. The current workflow requires manual PO creation in Vista, copying Vista PO numbers into Tekla, and occasionally duplicating entries — “You’re doing it twice…that sucks,” was stated verbatim. There was also explicit historic automation using scripts (AutoHotKey) that nightly finalized items; Ricky reported he had received videos of that tool and would email the provider to reinstate an expired download link. Explicit action items recorded: complete inventory clean‑up and confirm final weight totals (owner: Inventory team), locate the nightly auto‑finalisation routine and retrieve scripts (owner: Ricky), review and close open POs that are fully received according to the PO finalisation flow, and confirm PO number consistency across new purchase markets. Purchasing consolidation was discussed repeatedly; the consultant and client recorded an explicit purchasing action: the purchasing team will consolidate items across multiple jobs (four jobs scenario referenced) to gain buying power.

Estimating, Quantity Take‑Off, Pricing and Estimate Configuration

Estimating workstreams and quantity take‑offs were reviewed in depth. The Friday session captured a category summary expectation for the project that explicitly listed total material weight = 16,000 t, labor hours = 12,000 hrs, an example monitor‑cost of $1,000,000 and a remainder/example total of $2,000,000. The transcript described take‑off practices — quantifying columns, braces, vertical beams and turbines — and demonstrated category columns showing single‑line summaries with full reports listing all columns and associated quantities. The consultant showed how to pull down columns to generate an aggregated piece‑mark list and suggested use of preferences/tags (e.g., Jira) to streamline column selection.

Estimate configuration details were preserved from the transcript: estimates contain separate cost and sell fields that must be edited via Base Setup; cost‑related fields appear in the lower portion of the estimate summary (“bottom colors”). Pricing examples and margin language were explicit: the client referenced a desired mark‑up of 35% and a target margin of 26%, and a market‑driven 40% increase was also mentioned. Multiple cost examples were captured verbatim: $6,500; $38,000; $1,000; totals of $62,000 and $62,100 were presented. The transcript recorded specific labor‑line examples used in the change‑order dialogue: 3.03 h @ $8/h → $48, and 85 h @ $100/h → $8,500; a proposed change‑order total of $5,000 was also explicitly cited.

The sessions contained explicit action items tied to estimating: generate a category summary report showing total tons (16,000 t), labor hours (12,000 hrs), and monetary values ($1M monitor; $2M total) — owner: Estimating Team — deadline: end of week. The consultant was asked to document the current take‑off workflow and compare it with a recommended quick‑view method, with the consultant owning that deliverable for the next session. Also explicit: return to Base Setup to edit cost and sell fields as required, and validate margin calculations (35% mark‑up vs 26% margin).

Labor Standards, Time Studies, Handling and Start/Stop Practices

Labor and handling workflows were a central thread across multiple sessions. The consultant demonstrated default and edited labor times: default unload/handling = 12 minutes, move = 12 minutes (with another reference to 18 minutes), cut time had been changed to 6 minutes in one example. Demonstrated PX edits showed increasing unload by 10% from 12 → 13.2 min, load from 14 → 16 min, and move from 18 → 19.8 min; a 10% handling adjustment was explicitly shown. The Friday session recorded a baseline cut time of 3.3 minutes for a specific task and an explicit client request to increase that baseline by “an additional three more minutes.”

Extrapolation and labor standard logic discussed that times can grow or shrink by multipliers driven by attributes such as cross‑sectional area, length or weight. The Friday and Monday notes captured an intention to run time studies: the consultant offered time studies for stainless material (“I have some time studies… we can do some time studies for some stainless material”), and an explicit action item assigned the consultant to conduct stainless time‑studies and report findings back to estimating within two weeks. The transcript also documented the client practice of conducting spot checks and time studies to capture a distinct data set for each setup, with sampling approaches (sample representative items) discussed on Monday.

Start/Stop and timer capture behavior on tablets and the production floor was also described: Start records start, Stop ends the activity and Update registers quantity. The Tuesday notes stressed training floor staff on Start/Stop usage and batch workflows. Explicit action items included performing a labor‑code audit and updating times where defaults remain (owner: Client with consultant support) and planning/executing spot checks/time studies (owner: Client & Consultant).

Cut, Notch, “Cut & Clean” Operations and Burn Rates

The team reviewed cut and clean operations and how to model them in the system. Multiple sessions recorded that “cut” and “clean” activities can be separated into distinct operations and then flow into a single downstream operation: the description field will display “cut & clean” and the consultant stated no change to existing operation is required to implement the split. The Friday notes explicitly recorded actions to implement the cut & clean split and verify operation description displays correctly, and to apply the discussed time increases (baseline 3.3 min + additional three minutes) and validate.

Cut/notch geometry and missing cut data were captured explicitly: cut data was missing for certain coats (“we have cuts not being here for coats”), notch dimension examples included “two inches and two inches… four inches,” and there were questions about flange width handling (examples: “scope of the width of the flange… 4‑H… it doesn’t really know how deep it’s going”). Machine and burn rate specifics were discussed elsewhere in the week: welding machine throughput examples were recorded as roughly 20 in/min for a two‑pass weld, another reference to 22 in/min, and estimates/assumptions for plasma/cutting speeds were discussed in detail on Wednesday. The consultant also captured the explicit client limit on cutting: “I can’t cut anything over 2030” (verbatim, no unit supplied).

Explicit operational follow‑ups included verifying cut and notch data for coat‑related components (owner: Client manufacturing data team) and reviewing percentage impacts on identified project groups (percentages cited verbatim across sessions: 10%, 18%, 40%, 65%).

Stainless & Carbon Size Data, Global Edit, Weights and Conversion

Several sessions focused on stainless vs carbon data integrity and bulk population approaches. The Tuesday and Monday notes recorded that several stainless‑grade sizes in the database contained zero‑dimension values and were “not active,” and that carbon‑size definition was not being populated correctly when seamless‑grade cloth data were missing — the explicit client suggestion was to separate carbon and stainless data planes to avoid mixing. The Friday summary listed explicit action items to define and populate missing stainless size dimensions (owner: Client size data team) and to clarify carbon‑size population (owner: Client modeling team).

Weight and density values were captured verbatim in multiple sessions: stainless density used in design software = 0.31, Harmony density = 0.28, Type 304 stainless weight ≈ 495 lb/ft³ (Ricky’s recollection), stainless quarter‑inch plate = 11.6 lb/ft², and quarter‑inch carbon plate ≈ 10.2 lb/ft² (values stated in transcript). Several inconsistent tube weight figures were preserved as spoken: 8.953, 9.9336, 8.81. The Global Edit workflow was demonstrated: the process of copying a carbon‑steel plate entry into stainless‑plate family (PL → SSPL) via Global Edit was recorded step‑by‑step and the consultant and client agreed to export current plate size data and perform a bulk convert in a sandbox prior to production rollout. Explicit action items were recorded: verify current SSPL weight values (owner: Client), export plate size data and perform bulk PL→SSPL convert using Global Editor (owner: Consultant), and conduct a sandbox test to observe impact on PAS, inventory and PO before production rollout (owner: Consultant & Client IT).

Tools, Interfaces and Integrations (Trimble Connect, Connector, Statuspage, Bitbucket, Jira, Vista)

A large set of integrations and tools were discussed and demonstrated across the week. Trimble Connect integration with Structures 2025 was shown as a bridge between estimating/modeling and detailers: shapes, grades and finishes can be shared via a Trimble Connect project and import pop‑ups will flag unrecognized shapes or grades; enabling that import‑screen pop‑up requires a “slight amount of set‑up” on the client side. The Connector feature was demonstrated as an automatic submittal retrieval tool that pulls files into a list view for import or rejection; rejection creates a log entry in “Tech Structures.” The consultant explicitly offered Connector videos for the team.

Statuspage was used for drawing navigation but displayed inconsistent behavior where highlight/column display did not always show the correct column; an explicit action item was recorded to configure Statuspage filters so column pop‑ups display full lists instead of single lines (owner: IT/PowerFab Admin; deadline: immediate). Bitbucket base setup and key changes were discussed; an explicit action item recorded verification of Bitbucket base setup and key changes (client requested). Jira integration was discussed in multiple sessions, with a recurring statement that it was “not producing value” in the current setup; the client said they would provide a Jira plan describing how upcoming work will be tackled.

Vista integration and PO/workflow interactions were documented: job numbers and POs originate from Vista in current practice and Tekla estimates cannot be loaded until a Vista job number exists; PO numbering was reconfigured to match Vista’s six‑digit scheme in the transcript examples. Explicit action items included validating export integrity and confirming PO synchronization procedures, and documenting the job creation sequence (Vista job → Tekla project).

Several practical tool items were demonstrated: ASCII export/import workflow for shapes (SSL/SSA conversions), use of ChatGPT to clean CSV files (consultant used ChatGPT paid version to clean an angle CSV and offered to email the cleaned file), and a gate‑distance CSV workflow to remove a 0.25 value globally. Action items: provide connector videos (owner: Consultant), verify Trimble Connect pop‑up is active (owner: Client), and clarify/document the purpose of other “tool where you can make” items and identify/train users (owner: Consultant/Tool Owner; deadline within 5 days).

Scheduling, Work Packages, Production Planner and Conferences

Scheduling and production planning were discussed in both tactical and strategic terms. The organization is ramping up to handle many small and large tasks and the client stated an intent to produce “10 to the quarter” and would provide a Jira plan describing how the work will be tackled. Work packages needed to be visible on the schedule and were required to populate a Gantt‑chart view; Ricky committed to verify work package visibility immediately. The consultant noted that schedule values must be entered before running a schedule or setting up a conference; an explicit action item requested the Project Scheduler to populate schedule values for the New Jersey contract and schedule a conference to review the plan within 3 days. The consultant offered to set up conferences but a conference was not held during the sessions.

Production Planner 2025 and related planner tools were demonstrated and the sessions captured an intent to pilot production planner usage and the need to integrate work packages with scheduling and forecasting. Explicit action items included establishing monthly automated reports (owner: Ricky within two weeks), populating schedule values for the New Jersey contract (owner: Project Scheduler within 3 days), and preparing the Jira plan (client stated they would provide).

Change Orders, Contract Values and Billing

The sessions covered contract recording and change‑order mechanics in the system. The client requested that the original contract value be recorded and kept visible; the system can show original contract value, current contract value and change‑order totals. At the time of the sessions no change orders had been approved: “No approved change orders to the contract.” The system’s change‑order dialog was demonstrated, with explicit numeric examples recorded in the transcript: proposed change‑order total $5,000; aggregate cost example $38,000; a 3.03 h @ $8/h example → $48; 85 h @ $100/h example → $8,500; additional cost line “6,500, Rovo, 14C” ($6,500); and totals of $62,000 and $62,100 were referenced as two cost totals. Pricing/margin language was explicit: client referenced 35% mark‑up and 26% target margin and a market‑driven 40% increase was mentioned.

Action items explicitly captured: enter original contract value in the system; create and submit change orders using the change button and route for approval; validate cost breakdowns and hourly rates in change‑order screens (e.g., $100/hr); and generate a preliminary report showing original contract value, total approved change orders and projected costs for the next five months (action items stated).

Quality Control, Rejection Reporting, NCRs and Inspection Checklists

Quality assurance and rejection workflows were discussed in multiple sessions. The team sought to centralize inspection and rejection data into one format — one report to capture all rejections, including for new projects. The consultant planned to “look ahead to the rejection reports.” The transcript explicitly recorded NCR numbers and visibility issues: “Each NCR, so again 55 NCR is in 22, 22. We’ll one. 23, 39, 24, 41,” and the team noted “No one else is seeing NCR.” Drop‑down menus for entering reasons and well checks were discussed and the need to make required fields mandatory was captured. Video documentation and training videos were recommended for pass/fail workflows.

Explicit action items included developing a unified rejection report template that aggregates inspection and rejection data across projects; setting up drop‑down controls for reject and well checks and making fields mandatory; ensuring NCR visibility for stakeholders (make NCRs 55, 23, 39, 24, 41 visible); and creating or updating video training demonstrating the pass/fail workflow and data entry steps.

Tablets, HoloLens, Mobile Devices and Shop UI

Device usage and workflow on tablets and headsets were covered with specific behaviors and device counts preserved in the transcripts. Tablet workflows (EPM Go / FabStation) were demonstrated with the Start → Stop → Update pattern for operations such as blasting and painting; tablets were described as iPad‑type devices in Otterbox cases, stylus support, with roughly 17 tablets on one site and a large charging station. The Monday and Thursday notes recorded adoption patterns (~80% adopt tablets immediately, 10–15% after weeks, ~5% never adopt), and the need to encode operators to specific tablets. The Thursday notes captured a HoloLens QC overlay workflow with magnets for alignment: the overlay accuracy was stated as “within 1⁄16 in” and a single intricate beam inspection was said to take about five minutes; Microsoft HoloLens hardware discontinuation and alternate vendors were mentioned, and a license cost reference of $2,500 was included verbatim.

Explicit action items included validating tablet encoding and resolving hardware issues, preparing operator training for Start/Stop/Update workflows, and standardizing magnet placement and documenting the five‑minute HoloLens verification SOP.

Welding Codes, Clips and Labor Formula Changes

Several detailed weld and connection items were recorded. The transcript referenced a “Thunder, Target Welding Special Code” that the client wanted to “use on these jobs,” and the client discussed defining a “stand‑by time” field tied to welding codes. Clip and weld configurations were reviewed: standard clip expectations (four clips = two per side), shear tab welding examples (welding on the 4‑inch side), and a specific need to change calculation rules — e.g., change the burn calculation for angles to use perimeter instead of width. The team demonstrated creating a custom “no‑rate” weld type by moving weld entries into a zero‑rate category to avoid automated labor assignment on imports and showed how to convert weld lengths longer than 20 ft to arc welds.

Explicit next steps included clarifying the exact definition and configuration of the “stand‑by time” field, modifying the angle labor‑code to reflect correct clip counts and perimeter‑based burn formula, removing weld entries from specific codes and creating zero‑rate weld types for imports, and testing re‑import of KISS/IFC files to verify zero‑time behavior on imported welds.

Nesting, Pro‑Nest, Plate Inventory (Prodisk) and Cut Workflows

Plate nesting and plate inventory were discussed in multiple sessions. The Thursday summary recorded an explicit Pro‑Nest workflow: select plates → Nest with Pro‑Nest → generate nesting file → import into PowerFab (via Progress integration) → Prodisk will control plate inventory. The transcript captured that plate inventory would then be controlled by Prodisk and that enabling Pro‑Nest and validating the flow into Prodisk were explicit next steps. The sessions also noted that macro‑nesting tools were not yet configured for certain wire or small items and that some cut‑list bundling remained manual.

Action items recorded: enable Pro‑Nest and validate integration with Prodisk for plate inventory, and define paint inventory specs and create live paint items in the system (5‑gal pails etc.), since paint is not yet present in inventory according to the transcript.

Personnel, Roles, Meetings and Training

A number of people and role‑based follow‑ups were recorded explicitly: Steph (code review), Tom (QC comment), Ian, Bismarck, Ian Jackbud, Jay McPhee, Gilbert, J.R.S., Mr. Ryu (leading truck person), Gavin, Mark, Alan and Jared were mentioned as stakeholders or action owners in various items. Ricky was named as the consultant owner for a number of actions (send calendar invite to Jimmy; provide connector videos; export cleaned CSVs; perform Global Edit/SSPL conversion work). Explicit action items included Ricky sending a calendar invite to Jimmy before the next business day, performing the demo and walkthroughs, reviewing code with Steph to verify size‑based logic, and arranging follow‑up/catch‑up meetings. The Friday summary also recorded requests for additional demos, code reviews and specific stakeholder coordination meetings (for example, a meeting with Mark to resolve bin locations).

Miscellaneous Equipment, Materials, Shipping and Yard

Several operational and materials items were recorded verbatim. Saw types discussed included N20 saws, small saw (M20), and a previously used M40 saw. Machine components and shop equipment referenced LEDs, AC‑DC power supplies, lathes and trailers; the client discussed uploading a “standoff” as a case. Materials called out included stainless, nickel, silver, brass, bronze and aluminum and the market for these materials was described as “extremely high.” Shipping cadence was repeatedly stated: orders run on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week, and the team expressed a desire to “follow us in front of it” and track receipts. Explicit action items preserved: confirm PO number consistency across new purchase markets and validate receipt tracking and visibility for Tuesday/Thursday orders.

Each of the items above is reproduced from the session transcripts and retains the owner/deadline language as stated in the recordings.

Concerns, Risks and Limitations (as explicitly recorded)

Throughout the week the transcripts recorded a number of risks and limitations that remain open. A duplicate database process was explicitly tied to system slowness; missing SQL port information and restricted admin access were explicitly impeding troubleshooting. Inventory reconciliation was incomplete and “on‑order weight still reflects the same” after partial cleanup. Several stainless sizes had zero dimensions and inactive records, and carbon‑size population issues were explicitly preventing correct seamless‑grade identification. Statuspage and drawing navigation displayed inconsistent behavior, and Jira integration was described as “not producing value” in the current setup. The lack of real‑time integration between Tekla and Vista results in duplicate manual PO entry and potential transcription errors. QC hours are frequently missing from schedules unless manually applied — the transcripts flagged actual QC utilization as much higher in some cases (examples included observed QC totals of ≈140 hours when QC is included, versus expected ~5 hours for short checks). UI stability issues (spinning wheel, job‑site save crash) and hardware/network variability were recorded as sources of user friction and operational risk. All of these items were explicitly recorded in the session transcripts and are carried forward as constraints the teams must address in the actions listed above.
