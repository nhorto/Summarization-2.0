Administrative Information / Administration
- Friday: Reviewed reporting, estimating workflows, job-release process, and data/integration considerations within Tekla PowerFab, including cutting constraints and planning for expansion. Planned documentation control and standardization initiated via Tony’s case; noted a lag in documentation and plan to address it through formal standards development and exportable documentation. Dartmouth was referenced as an April milestone with scheduling relevance. Next steps included producing a follow-up report next week and refining planning approach (including Jira) to address workload ramp-up.
- Monday: Focused on data management, scheduling, reporting, detailing workflows, and systems integration with Trimble Connect as a data bridge. Addressed governance of imports/grades and improving estimation/production alignment. Next steps included continuing planning and aligning on 2025 readiness; calendar invites and detailer upgrade were actions to pursue.
- Thursday: Maintained governance and cross-tool integration emphasis (Jira, Trello, Bitbucket, Loom, MediRoute) and reviewed progress signals for production control. Next steps included continuing refinement of work packages, routing/triggers, and aligning inspections/reporting workflows with project data.
- Tuesday: Acknowledged governance and data-management context with emphasis on audits (AI audit readiness) and cross-system data flows. Next steps included preparing for the AI audit, finalizing PO-finalization practices, and aligning Vista migration with cross-system governance.
- Wednesday: Initiated setup for an Oracle database and discussed on-premises server integration; noted county software feed considerations. Next steps included setting up the new Oracle database, advancing on-premises IT alignment, and clarifying county software integration roles.

Estimating
- Labor Codes
  - Explicit discussion of labor codes and a plan to create/open labor codes for estimating paths; the goal to store new labor operations in a new labor group and allocate time, determining display-only versus active use in estimation.
  - Next steps included creating a labor operation for the estimating path, mapping to a new labor group, and ensuring there is an explicit labor code that calculates hours for change orders or similar kit work.
- Carbon vs Stainless Sizing
  - Finalize approach to carbon versus stainless sizing in estimates and production data, including how these are mapped and presented.
  - Stainless conversion and weight calculations were discussed separately (see Stainless Conversion / Weight Calculations).
- Stainless Conversion / Weight Calculations
  - Stainless conversion is non-linear; tests across sizes are needed to form defensible factors; density values noted (stainless ~0.31; carbon ~0.289). A baseline size should be tested first, then 1–2 additional sizes to develop non-linear factors; document results and refine conversion factors iteratively.
- Time Studies / Data-Definition
  - Planned time studies for stainless materials to evaluate contamination reduction and equipment/consumables changes; finish size definitions for stainless materials (especially zero dimensions); evaluate extras (labor, wellness) and potential manual overrides; align carbon vs stainless handling in estimating workflow and production data.
- Change Orders / Estimating Path
  - Discussed how change orders (CO) or kit work should be represented in estimates; requirement to ensure change-order hours are calculable via a dedicated labor code; automated reporting considerations related to estimating data and CO impact.
- Breakout Logic / Costing Structure
  - Explicit next steps to break cost-out by intended breakout logic (organized by cost code and area); map open labor codes and allocate time; determine display-only versus active use in estimation.
