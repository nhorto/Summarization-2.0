1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,141
I just don't care. John Snell.

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:06,962
You heard it? Jared, so he'll probably know this one.

3
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,851
Jared is probably Christmas present.

4
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:13,039
The dude, the dude,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,027
I don't know you mention the dude yet, but he's a big fan I'm

6
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,477
actually riding on that right now. He said,

7
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:23,276
oh yeah, he said, but we can both appreciate it very respectfully.

8
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:25,871
He posted it to the job, but don't post it around.

9
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:28,963
and Thunder, Target Welding Special Code,

10
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:30,973
and that we can use on these jobs.

11
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:34,577
So we can say, OK, standby time or whatever you want to call it

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,501
like this. And so, again, we can say, yeah, we can do that. Yeah,

13
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:40,234
so that's why I'm not even in the front now. I hopped into the

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,153
gym. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

15
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:45,508

yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,650
So, in that way, with respect for all of our time,

20
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,994
growing, layout, and all of our other stuff to be in,

21
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:07,510
we can still just get in the absence of our other stuff. 775,

22
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:11,462
put it in and decorate it. Then make a little channings.

. .

30
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,341
. and that's what we think of the human system for time,

31
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,825
for the time to go and that's how it's going to be like on

32
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:04,044
a shaped pocket. Here's what you get,

33

48
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:50,132
but he doesn't know It's like, you know, it's happen. It's gonna happen.

49
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,740
It's gonna happen. It's gonna be there. It's gonna be there in .

50
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:06,441
I-I-I-I One.

51
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:11,441
That's

52
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:17,051
smart, and now I'm going to take the Gira Mikes.

61
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,280
I would give you a search statement. Oh, there you go.

67
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:01,073
so. So, that is not it without it.

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,771
Yeah, yeah, I got some good context in the valley.

69
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:07,396
How are you? Uh, um, as soon as I see it.

70
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,651
Well, I've sent a Bitbucket, let's get it a lot. Ready.

71
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,761
Yeah. It's 31 days. So, seven thousand dollars.

72
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:15,347
I'll see you Bye guys. That's definitely Bitbucket's portion of it,

73
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,496
absolutely. See, uh, the things we've given,

74
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,866
spiders and unsterled, and bright stuff. Uh, uh, uh,

75
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,130
ehm. That's all. I'm so sure it's the same thing I thought of.

76
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,751
I don't see anything. I've got all this research on the body.

77
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:29,411
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm sure you show See you the face.

78
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:32,002
He's really, really excited to have him. Don't have him,

79
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,737
they say. So, you're not even going to be able to see that.

80
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:37,083
He's not going to shock. He's, yeah,

81
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,743
most. Almost. Kind of the stuff is in drag, but that's what we have,

82
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,855
our, our ranking. See,

83
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,918
we look for the ethics there, it's not good.

84
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:47,863
Guys, mostly, you know, and we- They want to have prices done then,

85
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:51,457
we'll be able to do it in time, and then we'll do that slowly.

86
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,531
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, here I go.

87
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:57,370
Yeah, I think the good, the only way to set it is that you

88
00:04:57,455 --> 00:05:00,168
don't have anybody's, there's a certain way to high distribution,

89
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,645
or all of you have to go, you have to go, go, you know,

90
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,348
it's even, butinent it allows us to become,

91
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:11,562
OK, I'll see you then. and uh, Empy Mine will be caught.

92
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,999
One of the uh, can you tell I need my childhood? Not to,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,710
I don't know if I'm very little to study, but that's when I said

94
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:18,658
I need my school to see Taylor right now. They have three or two

95
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,601
miles in their bus, and that's the end of the tunnel. So that's the

96
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,691
end of the tunnel. We have two disabilities here,

97
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,696
and we have a security hub. M***********.

98
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:28,517
You need to do 93 tons a day.

99
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:33,736
Yeah, it's like 81-0 day.

100
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:36,643
Isn't that neat in every single one? I think we could try.

101
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,142
But, uh, we thought it was gonna be like a child in Stockholm.

102
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,882
Yeah, so. Okay. I had a lack of the dog. He got some context

103
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,908
like that. We had freedom, melody with the, um, play,

104
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,660
uh, sound like those. Those, they're trucking. Thank you.

105
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,058
All we can are out of the middle. It's interesting that tuning to the

106
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:57,856
working 80 and 26 cents a time profit award versus standardization.

107
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,730
. . . . . ah, so I tried to find Justin,

108
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:03,369
so I use mountains, I know,

109
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,896
it's not on the server.

110
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,941
Now that I've got left, it's,

111
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,828
it's out of my head. It's, it's so jimmy.

112
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,083
You that. See if you work with, okay, we have to run.

113
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:15,247
Have a s I've got a lot of this.

114
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,727
I got it. It's worth it. I can't accept this.

115
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,971
We've always been around and talk to the Bushlow Church, Baldwin,

116
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,102
but if I just give you a chance to do it, I'll be sure

117
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:28,059
I'll be sure to do it. I'm not, I'm not But can't accept it.

118
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,233
I'll it. It's just the go and do table,

119
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,238
throw it in the top. They're doing a template, but I just want to

120
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:36,233
steal. They really don't want to make sure right now that you've seen how

121
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,005
you're doing, so I'll be sure to make sure honest. Thank Thank you,

122
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,135

123
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:46,954
Thank you. Thank you. We'll in the next and instead of beginning

124
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:50,625
to hear about Trello so far, I'm not doubting that I have to listen

125
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,395
to us, uh, when the ladies don't leave my response or it leaves me

126
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,500
so- Here's a, And there's an app that you should have,

127
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,415
so you should have, uh, if you sit there and come in and talk

128
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,841
to them about it with them. Okay, it's close, it's okay,

129
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:02,272
it's okay, it's okay, it's Do I mean, say aye, look. I'm gonna You're

130
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:04,986
not in pain. You're gonna struggle with tech.

131
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:07,709
Otherwise, all our details are bad. It's made for them.

132
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:10,211
And we sit on the of us and stay happy with it.

133
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,279
I'm gonna have to say, okay, that's good.

134
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,790
That's good. We might add new stuff.

135
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,712
Nothing. Come on, we should pick a song for you.

136
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,770
We are just, I'm gonna start it, but I've been.

137
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:23,140
It's definitely gonna keep us going.

138
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:26,291
We can't be crossing it with Bitbucket.

139
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,659
and a chance at that. I was right little.

140
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:30,593
I would say to come up and reach and we're not getting any of

141
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:33,041
these. Yeah. I don't mind now obviously because I've always able to have that

142
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,316
lookin' out as a decision. I'll in the video. Yeah, it's fine. So, you

143
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,418
guys know later about stock pace.

144
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,483
I'm just going to buy some of the sunny nights.

145
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,272
Bye bye. Thank you very much. I'm here to see how St.

146
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:46,033
Gilston figured that. Okay, that's not really the deal.

147
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,291
You only see the results. Do you have any comments?

148
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,411
So I should have a plan. Yeah, that was it.

149
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:54,740
I haven't launched it yet. That's the deal. Give us a better question. I

150
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,451
don't know where to go.

151
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,636
And that's, again, to all the people that,

152
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:03,300
uh, got anything, wanted to find it, and to give it to the team.

153
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:06,551
So, uh, uh, I'll start with you in the next one.

154
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,588
I remember you all started doing this kind of thing.

155
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm a new 20 cents on the beginning. So, uh, I'm interested. We'll be

156
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,968
back for a second. Last year, next week. Let's if we can see how

157
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:15,320
we can see how we get started.

158
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,527
selected from accident,

159
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,576
so borrows.

160
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,661
Yeah, the default, the 10-game,

161
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,091
it has to hit. So it works.

162
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,906
I'm hitting the 1.5, so I'll save you.

163
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,909
We are. I said it was a good program, it's interesting if you ask

164
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,222
it, even if it doesn't have the one day to stall the challenge.

165
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,495
Yeah, he's down on the middle of the night, but yeah,

166
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:40,367
he does. Bye Yeah, yeah, yeah,

167
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:44,707
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:51,520
I need you to take this over,

169
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,139
guys. I just popped in. By the way, I thought you were gonna be

170
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,357
destroyed. I'm gonna be recording recording for you. Be in service. Get inside,

171
00:08:56,358 --> 00:09:00,265
it's changing, so we're all curious to hear what that's gonna be.

172
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,327
Change the lighting, but light it. Yeah.

173
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,151
Yeah. and all my lips, it's a good word.

174
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:08,598
Ah, neither. Alright,

175
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,619
okay. Okay, it's a time for you guys. That's it,

176
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,810

177
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,390
You guys are safe but please be got it.

178
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:19,261
You don't. Still got to be hard and- That's right,

179
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,724
that's right. And then it's time to become that gap and come that gap.

180
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:24,300
It's about good, you know, time to use it. I appreciate you playing with

181
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,896
it. Take care guys. Please see you then. Good luck.

182
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,189
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You made it?

183
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,273
You made the way. Alright, good. Thank you. Okay.

184
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:36,273
I

185
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:01,486
feel bad Muffles with you and like,

186
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:11,921
Umm, I think you got to do

187
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:14,582
it again. Umm, you got to, yeah, I don't know if you're using homes.

188
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,906
Okay. Yeah, one brand new security character,

189
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:21,083
so that's the other guy, too. That's the other guy,

190
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,784
That's the other guy. . Oh,

191
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:26,103

192
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,208
they're really fun. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye.

193
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,216
Bye. Bye. Bye!

194
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,947
Okay, I'm cool.

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,217
Alright, give them a cheap bow. Umm, yeah, and they're so good. You have

196
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,699
to have it. Steve, buddy. I think these guys are com- They did a

197
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:43,112
new guy, right? And then they're aligning systems.

198
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,296
So I think when all these are positions, I think they've got,

199
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:50,175
Bunch of the system, they're throwing work straight out of soda,

200
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:54,413
and I'm not even stressed. Today's baby housing,

201
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,696
so they- And guys next time. They've been doing that for like a period,

202
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,287
and we hope that we must be about decisions like this,

203
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:01,473
you know? So there is a maintenance station.

204
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:04,047
There is a pocket like we're going to have a Bye-bye. And then it's

205
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:08,833
just like, oh, you need procurement?

206
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,471
Okay. Okay.

207
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:15,023
And I hope to speak to you if you haven't said it.

208
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,599
This one. You need to find an establishment.

209
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,393
established. So yeah,

210
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,216
people will be hired to find stuff in the G.O.

211
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,626
and the student administration, but they're not. You sure,

212
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,940
but it's just some people eating those bad stuff.

213
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,046
I mean, I'm a man,

214
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,531
I'd love a student purchasing person in there.

215
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:39,210
. . I was around the morning now.

216
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,414
Here's the right amount of controls, not too much, not too little.

217
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,825
And I will like to get a block in the system.

218
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,030
What we were trying to do is, uhm, cool all

219
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,605
the water. you Purchasing for all the different,

220
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,580
uh, shops together so that we could,

221
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,651
uhm, uhm, uh.

222
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,643
The demand and unfortunately, you know, purchasing power is,

223
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,744
we need to find power in the community.

224
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,995
Yeah, I wish we were kind of here with our consumables. Now, before we

225
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:09,546
start the list, the work you have in a deal with, uh,

226
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:14,050
we were talking about air and gas. That's just looking over there.

227
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:19,697
You know, right there. I mean, we, they gave us

228
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,475
the bananas system, so we basically put the long,

229
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:27,935
long child's eye on this. with us. I

230
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,188
got all over it, you'd buy her. I was sent them a master of

231
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,811
agreements, and,

232
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,980
and it stopped me,

233
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,223
like that. And, uh,

234
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:38,049
things slowly go down. See,

235
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,794
I think that I'm gonna deal in this book. You have a whole new

236
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,831
example of them, so they didn't want to.

237
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:43,217
Let's go.

238
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:50,078
It's time.

239
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,401
It's time. It's time.

240
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:58,973
It's time. Must be. You It's Loom,

241
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:02,393
MediRoute. Check our open up is four o'clock.

242
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:04,451
Turn in the notification button. If you,

243
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,489
I'm good. I'm What is this?

244
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,434
There is nothing. Thank you. Alright,

245
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:17,050
you what I'm gonna I have a lesson about

246
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,439
the anomaly. Can we show him?

247
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,481
you. Thank you,

248
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:24,710
Jeff. I'm selecting us. We're doing this today.

249
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,896
It's, uh, the, rounders, yes.

250
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:30,424
I mean, is there any part of the vlog? Bye And we're seeing an

251
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,816
edge of this. We're at this thing. We're changing through something.

252
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:35,378
We, uhm, no, there's not any vlog we're shooting at.

253
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,730
Here we go. We'll see you in the other things where it is.

254
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:42,906
I mean, you can walk the estimates up so we don't change.

255
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,431
We don't revolve on that. Terros, we can do it.

256
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,582
. Can you dump the old settings?

257
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:53,476
Yeah. So we have the old settings.

258
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,908
. Yup. Yup. You can set up a different shop,

259
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,451
you know, and ere well. Well done.

260
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:05,508
Well, some things are differentially upshot,

261
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,894
like the television stuff, differentially upshot.

262
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,515
you about shot, we built a new shot,

263
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,647
and we built a hole in the video, and started placing the video.

264
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,130
But it's so structural, it's ready to slide down.

265
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:21,972
Go! I'm gonna

266
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:24,585
do that,

267
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:24,931
I'm gonna do that, while my body's not gonna fit into the tube, that

268
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,303
won't. . That will not stay the same,

269
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:30,761
you can wonder if you're supposed to have the other ones that are staying

270
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:33,203
across the shot. But yes, you could.

271
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:41,380
. .

272
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,165
. I think, uh, I mean, I'm glad they only got him to do

273
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,847
it, right? So, he's the master of that,

274
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:50,093
uh, thank you. Please. That's it. Please. You know,

275
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,302
we start changing the lot. They say, uh,

276
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:55,218
boom. We start changing the area. It's a brainwave. That,

277
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,052
ah, um, I W and still,

278
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:01,751
you know, you can do it. You can do that in a minute.

279
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:04,023
You'll find nothing last week or something,

280
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:06,175
but you know how to do it. from Taiwan. And then,

281
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:10,975
you'll find something last week or

282
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,511
something. me.

283
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,914
That ever changed, and when I said those,

284
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:18,556
I kept saying, how did I just, you know, be able to do that.

285
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,320
I just, yeah, I don't know. Can you do that?

286
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:25,799
So, uhm, but the language was the main testament in,

287
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,056
uhm, uhm, uhm, I was confused. The only thing that was in the beginning

288
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:31,166
is so much- . . . I just didn't know what the question was,

289
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,378
why didn't you find something, to be,

290
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,095
I didn't fit in the ground the size of it. Yeah,

291
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:39,032
I was just. Just be. We earned this at the end of the,

292
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,547
at the end of the week increases,

293
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:44,097
at the end of the week increases, at the of the week,

294
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,520
we earned it all. Stay safe. . . . we will work a Bound

295
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:51,279
with Fontana is going on, tx set up c5ble. So should be a .

296
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,500
. .

297
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,247
and then the changes are going to be,

298
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,501
um, it's way faster than me.

299
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:02,769
Adjusting the speed and then also a Putting the parameters,

300
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,805
kind of, amongst all parameters in the plate.

301
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,002
I was told to support that. That's about it.

302
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:09,204
That should have been going to be the third thing.

303
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:12,640
It is One day, we did it for ourselves.

304
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:17,531
That's a nice, uhm, changes that you would pick up.

305
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:19,631
You're using that. Oh, but it's, uhm,

306
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,750
60% of the time from using it.

307
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:25,229
While Atlassian seems to want stuff for a look at it,

308
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,774
shouldn't it? Have you given a different vision of the format that I had?

309
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,686
So, uhm, and if I didn't even say,

310
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,526
well, I think they should go up here. I'd like to- And they know

311
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,550
that, also, these are my favorite. It's cool.

312
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,432
It's not here. It's not tuned enough.

313
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,531
They know that they're- I'm not even asking.

314
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:43,640
You can see what you've got for this right now. So,

315
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:46,633
typically, we're getting you needed to advance so you can use it all the

316
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,576
time. You know what I mean? Uh. Now,

317
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:52,901
you know what I mean? But it wouldn't be nice.

318
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:57,461
Thank you. That's

319
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:58,516
some, uh, I'll take it.

320
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,832
The electric tool portion of it again is going to meet in the accuracy.

321
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,336
Since June, it's not a good swine. Probably it's something to take care of

322
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,388
it. Uh, but, I that,

323
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:18,597
uh, uh, we have a lot of implementation.

324
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,719
Um,

325
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,675
this, You think is a problem for this,

326
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:29,294
uhm, if you want to be on-site at the beginning.

327
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:33,050
I'm excited to, the-the balance of this area,

328
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:37,832
uhm, however, with part B in that

329
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,257
section. in the show. The coding is shipping your city,

330
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,409
uhm, fully adopted girl,

331
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,935
uhm, leak, uhm, we could call All for

332
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,407
us, or, uhm, the Agile,

333
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,253
kit them in here, and then also,

334
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,491
uhm, kind of a report. Let's get started.

335
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:57,316
So we don't, you can, uhm,

336
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:01,310
so I don't can watch this back after, because that is the coding coordinator.

337
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:04,022
We'll see you in a minute. As well, uhm,

338
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:08,433
so I'm missing. He'll be facilitating some of the coding staff that bring Chris

339
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,511
Peña in the mirrors so that we can kind of.

340
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:13,976
We'll open the process of the code, what he's gonna do when he's seeing

341
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:17,442
when they're out there, the shit is, and then the coding staff's there to

342
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,732
kind of, at least. He's troubling his task,

343
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,738
and that's really all I can do. He knows that I've been,

344
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,057
you know, it's a fully functioning system at this point.

345
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,558
No. No. The implementation side of it's just us getting equipment in the

346
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,356
guy's hands and saying, this is the law.

347
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:38,088
Follow it. Yeah, bye. What is going on?

348
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,667
What is going going on?

349
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:42,225
What is going on? It's part of it. It's not going to be the

350
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:45,143
stage. It's going to main thing. It's not going to release into the shot.

351
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:48,133
So, here goes your thing from receiving volume.

352
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,536
You can do it in depth. Yeah.

353
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:52,746
So, it's just a module of power.

354
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,836
Yeah. I look at it like a simple vibration.

355
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:58,971
I look at it like the input. Yeah. With you know,

356
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,332
if that's where you're digging this further, drag the shot and use the input

357
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:02,950
for exactly.

358
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:11,573
This time, since we've been, I was trying to,

359
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:13,599
I was trying, don't even get up,

360
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,759
get in fast order, come on. So,

361
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:18,726
I'm a bit, like, a little bit of snack essential when I'm here.

362
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,352
Can you send me a little bit of this? Can you meet your partner

363
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,531
when you get the chat, please? Yeah, I need the real,

364
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:28,078
What happens later? I need to get a lock installed first so you can

365
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,116
be brought. Yeah, so I need to start getting actually,

366
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,584
them. Yeah, do you want to reach up to Ann?

367
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:36,658
You know, you guys have the people that are going to use it.

368
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,863
Yes, we want to do the go training time.

369
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,473
All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right.

370
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,961
All right. Bye.

371
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,320
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

372
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:50,498
Yeah. Yeah. Possible day at a time of difficult

373
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,289
days. I'm Dennis, Jennifer Kerry, and umm,

374
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,576
and horse back, read sit down and eat.

375
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,693
Go over the, umm, you have to go to each tablet.

376
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:01,165
I got 17 packages, so I should go there.

377
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,551
I'm not aiming to do the issue.

378
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:07,948
Alright, I have a big charging station off of this.

379
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,308
Okay. Yeah, we can sign everybody.

380
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,480
Bye bye. But, I'll,

381
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,820
I'll share that. I don't want to be able to log in. It's not

382
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,898
fast. I don't care about it. Yeah,

383
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,522
I'm not gonna use regular. Thank you. I know from weeks where I've been

384
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,787
looking, ouuh, and a smosh you start to w Cut the,

385
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:30,329
his ears go so fast. Yeah, straighten it up. Okay. There are

386
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,588
a skin stop here, you can't put a cheap phone before us.

387
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:37,480
I usually don't do much. Okay. We're too committed.

388
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:41,494
I'm not trying to handle it right now. This is about a month and

389
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:44,022
a half. Oh. Last time.

390
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,651
Thank you. and the other side.

391
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:51,514
It's actually, it's a 24-hour

392
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,609
turn. Oh Stocks, yeah,

393
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:57,320
and then you go all the long guys to war and he's got like

394
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,556
a frickin' brand and a complete frickin' snack No.

395
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:02,621
Hacks in there. So,

396
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:06,666
I would only do pretty good and then shop as a community.

397
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,964
You're welcome. Yeah.

398
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,689
Touch my step, you're gonna get my ability to order the step,

399
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,494
take it away from you. So.

400
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,518
It's so amazing.

401
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,411
It's so amazing, guys. You can hear us, but you can put a- It's

402
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:28,612
okay. No invoices. Because I've got a lot of them.

403
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:32,565
It's something that you can question.

404
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,739
We'll see you in just a little.

405
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,903
You think that's, so it's important.

406
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,677
You know, right? Later. Yeah. Nice.

407
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:48,574
Thanks so much for listening.

408
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,627
I think it's back with a nice little. You really stood in the data

409
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:56,795
to help me work. I've been working a lot back to you and uhm,

410
00:21:56,796 --> 00:22:01,348
uhm, replace two types of stuff. I've been working lot back to you and

411
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,551
I've been working a lot back to you.

412
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:06,551
I've lot back to you. Thank you very much.

413
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:12,874
Thank you very much.

414
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:22,571
. .

415
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:24,648
1,000 apps is going to be squeezed.

416
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:27,090
Um, we have to run the work that I will do,

417
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:29,583
which will be going to be squeezed so the details vary today.

418
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:34,555
So I'm going to say, that's- It looks States state of Iowa,

419
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:38,377
you mean? Do we have a light force? Oh, no, not the loads that

420
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:41,993
you- You don't even if the local or shop would be a statute.

421
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,118
Now, we're gonna give K a credit to coupons they gave us for a

422
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,999
field job. . . . People are always speaking of paper as such and

423
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,221
paint and they ask to get a video and they gave it to us

424
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:59,401
for free disks. Yeah,

425
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,146
we have something that we were painting for that so we kind of, I

426
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:06,175
would- We took pictures of seeing all the caveats through it and

427
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:08,404
I hope it's something that we can look at and, you know,

428
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,631
let's come in here to- Oh, I think Jeff's gonna take- Thank you.

429
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:14,975
That'd be- that'd be awesome. I think it's fun,

430
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,031
it's not better. Take a once and get out of here.

431
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,249
Everything that's not the pressure in this is. Oh,

432
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,762
really? That's in the chin. Okay. You're not trying.

433
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:27,412
That's- that's very good. Doing it. And that's really- Okay.

434
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,230
They're just pissing all their customers off.

435
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,111
That's what most of us are leaving. Later.

436
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:39,701
First lesson is,

437
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,244
you know, satisfy your customers. Thank you for your participation.

438
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:11,723
I don't know,

439
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:17,235
Oh I don't forget it. Yeah,

440
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:20,541
that was construction, wasn't it?

441
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:25,034
It's, uh, ending and shooting. Okay. Interesting.

442
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:27,412
I just haven't found the best way to search it.

443
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:30,526
What is it? I'd like to search it. How does it look longer?

444
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:34,062
It's gonna be hard. I'm going to talk about research. I'm already not going

445
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,775
to search the hard drive. Uh, and I would be.

446
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:39,388
I have some of the links in the video that are developing.

447
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:47,440
. . . .

448
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:51,326
. . . . . . . . For you, it's actually Microsoft.

449
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:57,131
Start the search, that way. You

450
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,753
know what I'm talking about, where this isn't the first thing about that.

451
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,661
It's a new way that it's about that. Thank for listening. I'll go out

452
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,929
and move it first. Thank you for joining us.

453
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,587
Let's just Okay.

454
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:16,166
First, first. I thought we brought them to each other at the top of

455
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,966
the time, so I had a lot of fun. What was that?

456
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,604
Good. Good. Uh, uh, the key sequence?

457
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,728
And then, uh, gonna be able to do a little speed.

458
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,759
Yeah. . . . So you can do one for the columns.

459
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,825
.

460
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:37,890
.

461
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:51,010
Thank I'm

462
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:53,656
so lonely. Ahhh.

463
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,977
I don't know if I'm here.

464
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,369
I'm not computer if you want to learn from this other students.

465
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:06,672
go to Clearcabs

466
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:09,219
with a couple of our reports from the past,

467
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,565
they can show. So, go. What's this,

468
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:16,467
uh, I hear you guys using the term,

469
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,923
like. Ah,

470
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:21,608
not with a word something, HoloLens, HoloLens.

471
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:25,620
Yes, and this is our HoloLens. So essentially. the day.

472
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:28,709
I'm let's go get actually. Alright. You know what, I'm not going to do

473
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,454
the fast station, and then we can overlay the model over our built

474
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:36,220
assemblies. of these. See if anything's off,

475
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:38,628
MediRoute, Loom, where it needs to be.

476
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:42,426
And, uh, is that a visual check or?

477
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:45,557
part of the just like the program of the service work to a comparison.

478
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:48,887
This is a visual check and we use the HoloLens,

479
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:52,581
it's within 16th of an inch. Thank you very But you have to pick

480
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:55,597
it up, or it picks it up and it won't you?

481
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:58,621
It picks it up. So, so I can help you keep.

482
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:02,516
You know, addition markers, we put these magnets that we'll pull in at the

483
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:04,827
reference point, and then we pull the correct,

484
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:07,406
um, model course. as as possible. I'm not supporting this,

485
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,536
and we'll go over and make sure it's scaled.

486
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:13,908
And then it takes about five minutes to do a very intricate beam.

487
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,147
And it's- It's just one of our quality checks that we are now encompassing

488
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:21,450
for the last year. We headed it last year to have,

489
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:24,233
The answer is a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:27,613
Yeah. So did you lay out on it? We have not gotten that far

491
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:30,506
yet. We do have some restriction.

492
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:33,731
Thank you. I would say with a, you know, open shop to sometimes one

493
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:37,283
of these, part of life would be if the sun is in your way,

494
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,948
you know. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck.

495
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:44,709
We, we used this performing card for QC guys just to do a,

496
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,848
uh, a QA. No. you on our side for our week.

497
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:51,590
That's part of our process in the show. Now since I'm people using it

498
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:54,731
in videos, that's layout tool. Yes.

499
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:59,094
A lot of the holidays were just continuing.

500
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,671
Yeah, Microsoft discontinued. Umm, there you go.

501
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:07,211
It's going to be 20 states, but they're not going to manufacture those,

502
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,279
but they are trying to incorporate either Meda or another,

503
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,543
uhh. I'm going to buy it.

504
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,337
Like, I don't know how it was going to be coming out of their

505
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:18,627
own person. Yeah. So, we're working with Fast Nation on,

506
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:22,420
in that regard, so. to the way in the United States of the Lush

507
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:27,731
and Bitbucket. So third party people has to do this as well.

508
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:30,327
Is it common to use it? Yes.

509
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,393
I don't know, people that do like not to belay them.

510
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,254
Alright. Not,

511
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:38,470
not for belay. That's, that's not common.

512
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:42,801
Uh, that's it. Like, I don't know that I'm ever sitting good.

513
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:45,018
Good. For layup purchases,

514
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:47,574
just, you see virtually the world, I see it.

515
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:51,347
Eventually they didn't want to come in on this glass.

516
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:53,739
Easy. Please. I think,

517
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,866
I think, I think, I I think, think, much here, and have, uh,

518
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,439
4.5-0 go-to-1, a lot of some spicy and wilder food.

519
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,367
We are waiting for one is trigger on the web, right? Yeah.

520
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,463
So, yeah, I think, I think,

521
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,761
all of it was, almost.

522
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:10,741
. Yeah.

523
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:12,769
It's pretty wild. Yeah. That one was, uh,

524
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,820
really, really trusting us to put that out of here.

525
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,176
You really enjoy eating the shop.

526
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:20,014
Yeah. But,

527
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:23,007
uh, process has gotten pretty good and we've,

528
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:25,684
uh, Bye. We've gotten some complaint where,

529
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:30,301
we're getting the IFCs with me from all of our internal,

530
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:33,626
internal detail. in order to see. So, uh, definitely is,

531
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:37,360
uh, nice to have.

532
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:44,742
Umm, customer requested Trello So, uh,

533
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:47,771
I will be this in the last half.

534
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:52,075
Yeah, I know how I did that.

535
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:56,113
Like, I thought the same way. So. Um,

536
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:59,943
and the sale upon us each other. This is what the APM looks like

537
00:29:59,944 --> 00:30:03,741
when you pull it up in your tablet. It's gonna be your signing screen.

538
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:07,586
Uh, you'll end up coming in here,

539
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:10,502
signing with your ID.

540
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:14,599
Uh. It's gonna ask you to do a pass,

541
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,227
he, maybe, you know,

542
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:23,600
send me to skip this one more. So,

543
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:27,364
this is what the mainstream is gonna look like with us.

544
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:31,695
us. And using the format that we're using at this point,

545
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,115
and the parts of everything you need will be in order to package this

546
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,262
portion. Bye bye. Umm,

547
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:41,385
we are seeing to make sure the proteins is on the same page with

548
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:44,785
their code, it's only projects. Thanks. Uh,

549
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:48,389
creating the work package for what they've outlined to the floor.

550
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,721
Um, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't use the exact same- See

551
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,294
ya. You can cross this floor that, that word to me.

552
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:57,345
Umm, I've lost it up at the start of the year,

553
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,648
and I'm trying to build scenes to do the bit.

554
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,013
Good. It's illegal, it's illegal.

555
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,683
Alright, span has not been there yet.

556
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:06,300
second.

557
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:38,491
You

558
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:46,969
know. your own. So, uhm,

559
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,576
you're going to the work that is just.

560
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,821
You need to get this, it's like, uhm,

561
00:31:51,831 --> 00:31:53,913
so that's the, uhm, that's it. So right now,

562
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:57,611
you'll have your work package. We're gonna change the subject.

563
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,746
. . and worlds sometimes . . you'll see further project ,

564
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:03,780
ah ok, and work properly .

565
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,184
. you know, ehm um,

566
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:09,649
but that's the more we can really get down to the nitty gritty of

567
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,611
. . . ok, this is what needs to be a humping course .

568
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:15,706
. . that's the whole middle this is . . this is the follow

569
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:18,005
and we can schedule those kind of things out .

570
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:26,834
. assign priority based upon what should be addressed with

571
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:29,191
that and said when you go into this work that you can access all

572
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:32,627
of and the assemblies that are associated with it,

573
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:37,044
you can get your drawings, this information isn't going to be practical for you

574
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,783
guys. But, uhm,

575
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:42,984
piece tracking is what's going to be relevant for you guys,

576
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,861
because you're going to be using the piece- Peace.

577
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:51,662
Um, we didn't set up any inspections

578
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:55,735
that are- I was trying to do the project.

579
00:32:55,736 --> 00:33:00,347
Um, so, you wouldn't be able to see the inspection

580
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:04,810
and the current can't set up the- Let's back to the screen. You'd have

581
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:06,191
to go back to the home screen and go to, uhh, probably my inspections

582
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,971
and do the- I'm sorry,

583
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:15,112
in that module, uhh, in the future of beta.

584
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:19,797
I'm guessing, potentially, it will be . We have any codes and inspections on

585
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,220
a project basis. So, in that instance,

586
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,928
you would be able to access them.

587
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,013
and and to the specific chat box,

588
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:30,537
um, production status.

589
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,576
This is where, if you guys haven't put these only projects,

590
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:36,662
it's simple. You know, it's gonna have prep and trying,

591
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,925
but this complex is gonna have prep, trying,

592
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:43,357
you know, MediRoute Thank so much for attention. Umm,

593
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:46,017
and then we can expand on that further as you guys have been going

594
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:48,241
on for our complex system, uh,

595
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:51,024
cracking the, uh, the- in-betweens,

596
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:54,009
uh, I don't know what the extent,

597
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,318
uh, we had, you know, too early for the calling set of things.

598
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,098
And in the next Did you have a financial system,

599
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:04,177
or what, uh, when, uh, I keep you over here quickly to career out

600
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:08,677
at an additional stations, and it's- I just can get you guys the ability

601
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,987
to keep track of each section of what you're going for.

602
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,240
Um, anything else? Okay, we'll see.

603
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:18,183
See can do. Also, the ability to create the list and,

604
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:20,616
you know, shipping inside of this. So,

605
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:23,931
word types and packages. you can be super helpful with core.

606
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:28,403
Keep it among them in one place with all the data where it needs

607
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:31,357
to be, and flow visibility. Let's go. So your job number,

608
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:33,666
your area of work start date, due dates,

609
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:37,227
and where it is. So,

610
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:41,961
um. I love you. This project doesn't have the piece

611
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:45,374
tracking associated with it, but I will go in here just to kind of

612
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,628
show you. you what this looks like for this project,

613
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:51,846
this one's gonna be catered if that actually doesn't have,

614
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:54,160
uhh, so I'm actually gone.

615
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:58,377
Bye! So, I forgot I adjusted some of our way to the certification models

616
00:34:58,378 --> 00:35:00,471
to have that in there. So,

617
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:04,653
this is gonna be the screen that, One of your painters is gonna have

618
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:08,188
up, and, or many of your prep guys is gonna have up,

619
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:10,571
and when he grabs a,

620
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:14,620
He has to work 15-some ways that he's taken over into the blast area.

621
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:18,611
You know, this freedom of this tablet, you're going to this app.

622
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:21,464
You have that sports engine typically here.

623
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,162
And when he's got everything ready to go,

624
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,651
he's going to come in here and hit start.

625
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:30,334
Then he can go start blasting all this stuff.

626
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,553
And once he has all of those,

627
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:36,269
it's definitely done. All Then he can come in here,

628
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:40,033
hit stop, and then go to update,

629
00:35:40,694 --> 00:35:42,736
and then first. Where is she?

630
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:47,288
It's going to be here.

631
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:50,831
That should be if all of those pieces,

632
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:53,207
A little bit, yes. So,

633
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,936
um, hit the start and beginning of it.

634
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,390
Update next quantity. Now,

635
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:01,007
that's the, I'm gonna be really brainy. I'm just gonna ensure that you guys

636
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,320
have the total count of what you're bawling for.

637
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:06,147
Instead of doing the max quantity, uhm,

638
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:08,575
and then you go in. There, you know the line by the line,

639
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:11,031
okay, I've got two of these, four of these, four of these,

640
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:13,536
four of these, and one of these, and then,

641
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:16,708
uhm, from there. I you click update,

642
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:22,931
and then this will get you a nice move.

643
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:27,652
. If we know the production sass into the form and

644
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,971
see income here to find it.

645
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,535
It does sound excellent.

646
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,454
So we're on the- on the variety of- didn't that turn off your payments?

647
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:41,511
I'm going do that's going to have a a little bit of a- a

648
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:44,092
little of a a little bit of a I'm sorry I didn't have to.

649
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:47,051
Yep. All right.

650
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:50,410
So,

651
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,246
now I don't see all of those,

652
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,741
I don't think I'll be just confused. Thank So, uhm,

653
00:36:55,742 --> 00:37:01,339
from that, then it would go

654
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,728
into its next area. Yeah Um,

655
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:06,302
so you could go back in your production tracking,

656
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:11,171
and, just hit it right.

657
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:11,130
. .

658
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,211
And then you go to time, go in the ad batch, and you involve

659
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:21,525
Atlassian process. It's our,

660
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:27,251
umm, the biggest thing that we're gonna wanna confirm is

661
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:30,181
When we want that start button to be hit,

662
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:35,061
is it when an operator comes over with a stack of

663
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:38,445
their Everything looks pulled out in the glass, and it's still on the pallet.

664
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,812
Before you guys put it up on some horses,

665
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:43,325
or if it's once it's on the stop.

666
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:45,837
The horses staged out, everything's ready to go,

667
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:49,132
paint comes ready to go, front is ready to go.

668
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:53,777
Then you hit start, and then you start. And then once you're done painting,

669
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,457
then hit stop. Um,

670
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:59,203
so that's one discussion that we'll have to have in months.

671
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:02,748
All right. Well, um, if he's trying to capture,

672
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,944
um, the full scale of this process.

673
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:08,984
See you in the next each of these categories,

674
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:11,565
off he's trying to capture the nitty gritty.

675
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:15,491
This is what it takes to blast. Hanley's going to be in between.

676
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:19,543
And then this is what it's going to take to paint everything else in

677
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:22,422
between me. So, umm,

678
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,682
so am I. Cheers. Trust me for you.

679
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:29,150
I know some of them are to do different activities when they're setting up

680
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,576
a machine for this job. Welcome.

681
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,583
I let you know. So,

682
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:37,126
that's one thing we want to make sure with the mode,

683
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,611
that's something that he wants included.

684
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:42,756
You can miss the portion, uhm, cause I think that would be relevant,

685
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,958
especially in the time. Yeah,

686
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,656
and they help us survive. They're calm, they're mixing their pain.

687
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:51,691
You know, again, and then the second part would be,

688
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,691
you know, those are, are spreading in his box.

689
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:57,866
Yeah, he's mixing his pain,

690
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,175
he's folding his line, he's checking it for him.

691
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:02,563
So they both like, they're,

692
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:05,171
they both would have a difference. We'll you in the tablet, they can go,

693
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:08,060
what's that? So I mean,

694
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:11,222
one guy, umm, the way that our estimates currently set up.

695
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,732
I'll see you that our factor is back with two guys assisting

696
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,324
in every portion of the work that you guys operate.

697
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:21,538
So, umm. With this tracking,

698
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,324
umm, the assumptions going to be that there is,

699
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,392
there's going to be quite a bit of promise. So.

700
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:31,727
So. You will be able to do that in the next version of the

701
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:34,251
center. If we're going to set you down with us.

702
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:37,627
Next, I'll go. Go on. Go on. Go on.

703
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:41,283
Go on. Go on.

704
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:43,871
Okay.

705
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,048
He could cross this category,

706
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:50,295
the piece of another one, cross this category with piece of 90 cat for

707
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:53,828
both of their times. Yep. Thank you. Um,

708
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,181
so, yeah, what do we need to cross this if we're done?

709
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,181
So, um, but this is the hierarchical- over the entirety of what's included in

710
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,694
the work package, or the sequence comes by.

711
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:07,320
You can do individual tracking. And a second.

712
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:08,857
Okay. In my mind,

713
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:11,592
I always contract with hours as such,

714
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:14,176
um, for peace and my love.

715
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:19,176
So, um. Bye. You can switch to part-timers and each

716
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:22,894
one of them has its own. They have a very complex assembly,

717
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:27,639
and they're all- of those relatively similar complex assemblies,

718
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:30,518
e.k. in time studies, on individual items,

719
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,671
like W and W with those- Good columns,

720
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:37,700
and say, well, that's a start of the project. We were doing one column

721
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:41,098
in 30 minutes by the end of the project. We're gonna have one column

722
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,933
in 10 minutes. Here in an hour,

723
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:46,213
so the next time you get it, you can shoot it right in the

724
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,936
middle and have, have the middle ground,

725
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:51,623
you know, taking the company sooner. So,

726
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:54,173
uhm, so that's,

727
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:57,273
that's why the main thing is, Uhh,

728
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:01,418
so, work that because it is super helpful having the,

729
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,458
the transparency, uhm, uhm,

730
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:06,007
uhm, uhm, The transparency, uhm, I forget to shoot on the screen.

731
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:10,015
I do, okay.

732
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:14,595
Alright. Okay, uhm, the transparency, I'm assuming this

733
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:17,979
function,

734
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,374
the work package isn't set. So, I'm that up,

735
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,915
and you guys are trying to, uhm,

736
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:27,090
you're, you're at this screen, you don't have to work that,

737
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:30,013
you just set up. Oh, she got the project you already received with us.

738
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:35,103
You can go into the project's position and then tilt

739
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:38,662
it for your project. Umm, we'll do 6.1,

740
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,583
4.5, then you can open the project and you'll see that.

741
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,477
and have a whole lot of All of this information is very similar to

742
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:48,714
what's in the uhh, uhh,

743
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:51,048
in the work package.

744
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:53,911
But. Bye. This is on a plastic scale.

745
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:56,421
So with this being said,

746
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:59,956
uhm, if it's a really big project, then you're gonna have to go- Mhm.

747
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:03,156
So, uhm, into your filters, up in the top here,

748
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:07,425
filter for the sequence and line that you guys have on the floor.

749
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:11,412
tomorrow. See you. Trinotope, and then you can go through this same exact process

750
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:13,770
here. That's just why work back.

751
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:19,646
It's a little easier for the benefits. Thank you. We did developing

752
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:23,956
the friends so that you You can actually,

753
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:26,359
and many of us. So,

754
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,880
check it out. What? Okay. Okay.

755
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:37,804
Good answer. Let's see. Okay.

756
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,821
So, that's the biggest thing is,

757
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:42,921
Um, with this,

758
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:47,090
we've got a bunch of devices that we're gonna be assigned to your guys,

759
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:51,472
and this is- This is what we have set up in the system that

760
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:56,048
well wants to use going forward, that everyone on this property

761
00:42:56,049 --> 00:43:01,458
is going to be- So, anything that touches the fabrication shop,

762
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:06,314
encodings, me and on. Bye I've got a picture set up in

763
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:10,893
the way that, you guys are going to see at least about coding set,

764
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:14,418
anything that's coding only. you think that would be,

765
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:17,734
uh, the session managed by Alan and,

766
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:20,288
uh, depending on the name of the mode,

767
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:24,790
what's on the- and uhm, that you guys will have this available

768
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,871
to you so that we can get percentage completion uh.

769
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,403
I'm worried guys that they have any process. Uh huh.

770
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:33,918
So, then, if,

771
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:36,851
if something's in here and you've got multiple jobs in there.

772
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:41,932
. And if ever guys entering these in within two

773
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,811
minutes of them getting completed, you can be at your best.

774
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:47,410
Yes. You know, hey, I just got a phone call and I'll be adding

775
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,433
a site for 15% complete. I'm dropping the prime.

776
00:43:51,185 --> 00:43:53,921
And, uh, perhaps 100%. I'm. Complete prime of spittings,

777
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,619
I'm completing now. Cause as soon as these guys mark this off,

778
00:43:58,124 --> 00:44:02,844
it's recently updated on, uhm. Um a fraction in your computer

779
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:05,487
version, and you can run from side to side immediately.

780
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:08,660
So, that'll save you if you haven't known. on,

781
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:11,661
we'll see you Bye. Top of the golf cart, run out there and physically

782
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,218
check exactly what's going on.

783
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,881
This should give you a good how to review, uhm. Remove.

784
00:44:16,882 --> 00:44:19,880
Umm, those are all these videos that are holding your guys to,

785
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:22,991
once this is done, it's not a, at the end of the day,

786
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,859
I'm gonna go get all these updated. Go. Get it done,

787
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,362
you have a channel right there, you're ready to go.

788
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:30,978
I can get it in the ones that say I'll just wait for them

789
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:33,115
to get them away and they submit it for a running. Don't forget. You

790
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:36,042
know, it's never a right to be with them.

791
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:38,713
So, this is not going to be a lie. But,

792
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:40,931
uhm, p-p-p-p-p-p-p, Let's talk about it. Thank you.

793
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:43,717
and I can find it.

794
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,487
Other parts. Just swap it out and you know.

795
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:49,829
And thing. And longer they have it, the longer I can. You Yeah.

796
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:54,595
And that'll get down there because it's our first goin' out a little bit.

797
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:56,891
So, it's still unforeseen. seeing you next year.

798
00:44:56,892 --> 00:45:01,700
I know the blackboard company here, everything is covered by whatever.

799
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:04,115
It's gonna be thundernose when it's on and out.

800
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:08,022
Bye. A couple more with the screen and there's a thin out of the

801
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:10,716
case. Just gonna be recycling,

802
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:12,747
you know, these are not cases, so they're gonna be six months. I'll see

803
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:14,761
you in a while. Okay,

804
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:17,643
so touch screen,

805
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,098
it's an iPad, you know, so,

806
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,491
uhh. So, I hate abilities,

807
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:25,654
and I'm pretty sure the one who was bad.

808
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:28,190
That's not what you're doing.

809
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:30,609
You know, so. Hey, what's up?

810
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,000
What are you guys doing? Yeah. So,

811
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:37,596
you'll give me a complete ephemera that's something we got Okay,

812
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,920
flip it and wish some screws, not uh, or whatever.

813
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:43,820
Let me know, use the screen and have a little keyboard more things and

814
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,082
the trunk keyboards are nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

815
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:51,569
yeah. You have our procedures, the stylists and some PR PT games,

816
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,684
uses stylists. So,

817
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:57,661
let's look at the main function of trying to get you ready to this,

818
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,965
because I'm sure they're probably gonna be having you push this to the guy.

819
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:06,111
You know, if you have any questions or anything along the

820
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:08,397
process of us pushing yourself,

821
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,943
and then you make, you can use our, uhm,

822
00:46:10,954 --> 00:46:17,193
Set and Stone Roll. A this

823
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:20,093
is an area of user friendly interface.

824
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,047
So, once your guys can use through the,

825
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:25,754
this is right here from this, this is right here. I hope this is

826
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:28,759
really going to be very good at talking with us.

827
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:33,025
And you can be- should be- so I just- uh,

828
00:46:33,036 --> 00:46:36,939
if you have all of the tablets,

829
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,010
so it's pretty much just going to be, um,

830
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,494
either Monday, next week. Thank you for fighting and you see we're gonna assign

831
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:47,692
devices to people and say, this is what you're gonna do or you can

832
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:50,356
vent tomorrow school. Don't believe so.

833
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:56,956
So, uh, so that will be,

834
00:46:56,957 --> 00:47:01,664
He'll also be a pushing factor on us if we need

835
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:04,940
to a separate meeting just with me and- And .

836
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:07,886
. All of the encodings guys, once we get devices and get the sand,

837
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:11,069
we can go all over that and just do it once over and be

838
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,216
sure we'll sit on the seat of age. Um,

839
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:15,412
but pretty simple process,

840
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,200
and then kind of tailing back into why these work-packing kids are super helpful.

841
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:22,561
Oh, come um,

842
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:25,435
like in the year, especially in the north side,

843
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,663
I know they tend to have you on a QC.

844
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:31,894
See soon. Sometimes,

845
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,251
so from here, you can access all of your lines,

846
00:47:36,252 --> 00:47:40,937
say the- or anything you guys are working on,

847
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:45,788
can come in here and just pull up this specific- on top of

848
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:50,079
what you mean and it'll have a lot of everything.

849
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:52,780
So, umm, if you guys do need the- I'll back.

850
00:47:52,781 --> 00:48:02,744
I'll back. Alright, so, Anyway. Yeah,

851
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:05,642
this is a funny kind. Also double checker,

852
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:08,498
I mean, it would be right, singers, if you like these years,

853
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,228
they're a big PDF. Yeah. Right under there, hit the drawing list and go

854
00:48:12,229 --> 00:48:17,124
back there. It'll, it'll sing right there to the very

855
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,375
land, this boy. And next time, 100 A and Y London Sword,

856
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:23,329
there will be lucky in the F right there. That would,

857
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:25,931
that would be the drawing. But I'll say.

858
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:29,036
I think there's more link, is that a display link that somebody has said

859
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:31,743
or how does that would be? Yeah, I'd like to be here if somebody

860
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:35,245
just, if you get it done, head to the caller and- Yeah,

861
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,871
yep. Sit on shoulder. So,

862
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,044
I'll make sure with all of our updates that all of our invertellers are

863
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:43,314
set up. 7 7 for the spill,

864
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:47,067
and that's, uhm, everything's very important for me,

865
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,931
because these, this one was clearly,

866
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:53,779
more and minuses the drives didn't work on the initial,

867
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:57,516
but he probably didn't get a request to file on him as a kiss,

868
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,182
uh, and they probably weren't coming in,

869
00:49:00,183 --> 00:49:02,827
uhm, the city government is there,

870
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:06,393
and then, uh, uhm, the drives zeroes. Thank so much for your So yeah,

871
00:49:06,394 --> 00:49:09,541
it looks like some of them said yeroms during the worst of the time,

872
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:12,376
yeroms, and, and it's similar to yeroms.

873
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,486
Yep, and so, yeah. So,

874
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:17,574
so I think I'll look at this one, and yeah, this would be where

875
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:21,921
you can do with reference to grinds, and you could pull out better.

876
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:24,652
Uhm, you don't have any inspection setup for,

877
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:29,684
for toting stuff in here, but probably an inspection Having did set up

878
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:31,986
for them all while he was in here,

879
00:49:31,987 --> 00:49:34,632
uhm, is in this general inspection step.

880
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:37,540
In here, you can put that in here.

881
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:41,330
You finally, the test that we paid for service per inspection,

882
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:44,083
and this one, uhm,

883
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:46,535
we ended up doing one test. Yes. One,

884
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:49,165
uhm, essentially you're going here.

885
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:52,543
Shout location, you can select, use the inspector,

886
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:57,621
and you'll select. lecture. You

887
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,071
can select what type of system you're doing, uhm, you can type in your

888
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:03,311
profile, uhm. Bye. You know,

889
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:06,335
any specific notes, uhm,

890
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:08,766
if you're in the clicking and final, uh,

891
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:13,671
generally prompt you to tick. You can take a picture of a fail attached

892
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:17,496
to this impression before.

893
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:20,457
and . And submit this so that this is not right.

894
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:23,085
And would it be associated with the job number?

895
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,175
Can you go into my inspection report?

896
00:50:25,176 --> 00:50:29,757
It's no different job. And pull a report that breaks down all

897
00:50:29,758 --> 00:50:32,921
the inspections for projects, specific projects,

898
00:50:32,922 --> 00:50:35,083
and you get that. You get it. It's not.

899
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,698
This would be, this would be where you would have since that.

900
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:43,625
So, you can always look up here. is I'm going to get back up

901
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:45,651
to the whole screen. Umm,

902
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:47,730
this is, uhh,

903
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:50,551
that was kind of the main function that I was trying to show.

904
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:53,215
Sure. I know you guys, umm, in the future,

905
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,938
potentially, they might have us add the guys in the top of the graphic.

906
00:50:56,939 --> 00:51:00,450
Umm, I don't know how that's- I don't- I don't know if you guys

907
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:03,660
are struggling, but they're the ten workers who are welcome enough to meet their

908
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,150
dad and get to their time differently, uh,

909
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,081
all over shotgun. Okay. Um, that even tastes more like

910
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,824
eating po- probably a lot of time,

911
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:18,136
you guys know, time tracking here.

912
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:22,451
Umm, it doesn't, it doesn't Jira's easily done.

913
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:25,671
Done. So, if we can venture into that,

914
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:28,652
um, the time tracking module, we can go over it better.

915
00:51:29,578 --> 00:51:32,888
So, here we go. The main functions will be projects,

916
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,271
um, and work packages,

917
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:38,849
and you can access any knowledge that you need for your work to give.

918
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,307
You go to do your peace tracking,

919
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:43,813
um, you check production statuses,

920
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,996
and I love you guys love it.

921
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:49,457
See you later. I'm going to show you later.

922
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,179
So this is also going to bite you back and why you didn't start

923
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,608
messing with me. It's a check that I've done with me. Yeah,

924
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,586
I'll- . I'll take a look at the scene and make sure you have

925
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:59,484
the power to have it all on your side. Yeah, you should be able

926
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:03,199
to see anything about it. Yeah, it's- Yeah,

927
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:05,371
really have. So,

928
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,391
basically, we don't have enough access to this technique to apply into the calibration.

929
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,832
Uh. Bye-bye. See how this,

930
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:15,742
this, you have access right when you go back to your desk.

931
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,309
Uh, you can also pull this up on your phone.

932
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,989
I don't You can tablet. As long as you have this domain,

933
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:26,104
then you can access, uh,

934
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:29,125
any of them. Hold So,

935
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:35,440
it will be really nice in a smooth part and way .

936
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:40,440
.

937
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:46,010
the organization that would be, uh, just a new product deal.

938
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:49,672
Uhm, in the first talk, it would speak any less.

939
00:52:49,673 --> 00:52:56,173
We'll see you in a little

940
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,480
bit.

941
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:04,093
Right now, umm, the most prevalent

942
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,332
group in there is home chain,

943
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,687
just to do it. Thanks. There's so many home chain jobs,

944
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,898
yeah, and we've all worked home chain times together,

945
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:14,020
umm, loosely, we tend to do a lot of job,

946
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:17,920
and then we can do that. Yes. Yeah. on a custom basis.

947
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:21,056
So, you're getting set in the biophiles group, those group teams.

948
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:23,700
Yeah. So,

949
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,302
but yeah, because otherwise,

950
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,437
if they're for property, you didn't see all that stuff.

951
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:32,844
That's enough. I can tell you that,

952
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,969
that really not a part of it. It's not. It's just possible for setting

953
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,016
up to make sure the code is just see what code is.

954
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:46,674
So, employee by employee basis is just filtering. So, I guess what I'm saying

955
00:53:46,675 --> 00:53:48,931
is, when I- I saw earlier on in that,

956
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:51,185
like, hundred and one, hundred and one twice,

957
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:55,031
you know. Who makes sure that it only shows up one.

958
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:58,739
So, it's just relevant to the coming work.

959
00:53:59,174 --> 00:54:02,254
So, the PC,

960
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:04,911
the ones that can- controls as soon as time does.

961
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:10,824
And, essentially, with that being of Rev-A and one of them being Rev-0,

962
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:13,835
the- there's a Rev-A in there, they cannot access that.

963
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:18,184
They don't- you know, there's a Rev-A in the system that'll show growing long-wise.

964
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:22,009
See you guys. Bye. But, it will only let you access the most current

965
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,167
Rev-A. Uhm, the issue with that one,

966
00:54:25,168 --> 00:54:28,450
I'd like to check and see if- Yeah. If our directors are late,

967
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:30,675
uhm, and make sure that,

968
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:35,312
because we have had connection issues between our database and meet them- I know

969
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,599
it depends on how you can call that to see Inspector all the time.

970
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:41,379
Anything's certainly going in here, what's going on,

971
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:47,104
uhm, pretending it is. next slide. Uh, exterior customer

972
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:50,665
giving us chis found in a different style of important than drawings that land.

973
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:55,343
Okay. Uh, like, a law practically, uh,

974
00:54:55,354 --> 00:54:58,864
for a directory not being set up correctly, so you need death.

975
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:01,672
Yeah. I have this impression by attempting to do it with the soul of

976
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,330
the race of drawings anywhere, all in shops,

977
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:06,645
go to the top of the modes, so there, go see if you see

978
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:10,856
the drop. If we, we set up the global fault directories,

979
00:55:11,181 --> 00:55:14,921
there was a map, your heart was generally not a thing on the server.

980
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:18,900
You used to basically stop the fault directories on the server.

981
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:22,438
So, if this wasn't for a larger hour on the server,

982
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:25,682
which really, like this, the C drive of a server,

983
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,529
then it's not on the C drive of a server. That might be something

984
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:34,409
we have to have. You I'm trying to speak

985
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,186
with you. It's a very long thing.

986
00:55:38,187 --> 00:55:43,157
Later. I'm just to you.

987
00:55:43,364 --> 00:55:46,528
Yeah, I wanted to work that. I was about to do one with the

988
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:48,716
good, the the good, the 1 of all the units.

989
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,013
She found it might be something else.

990
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:55,991
Yeah, this project, we ran all of it through.

991
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:58,233
And all of it was going to do good.

992
00:55:58,234 --> 00:56:01,258
Yeah, that's probably just going on with that drive of,

993
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:04,141
you know, on the server, probably. So I- Yeah,

994
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:07,330
I'm here at the full time.

995
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,611
Um.

996
00:56:09,622 --> 00:56:12,016
Bye.

997
00:56:12,017 --> 00:56:16,699
We can get it instead of our use of computer maintenance slash

998
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,346
whatever it can be out of here. It's gonna suck.

999
00:56:19,347 --> 00:56:21,605
Don't be it. I'll make no note of that so that I can use

1000
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:26,373
that to give it your ass. And if that's not even changing,

1001
00:56:26,374 --> 00:56:28,980
receiving will use this as well. Oh, yes.

1002
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:31,681
And then somebody sets their back into the,

1003
00:56:31,682 --> 00:56:33,953
uhm, step early, they're really cool to see.

1004
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:37,481
Uhm, they their portion will have,

1005
00:56:37,482 --> 00:56:40,138
uhm, uhm, the packages.

1006
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:42,606
Their portion will be, yes. Yes. Yes.

1007
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:46,460
Yes. fulfill.'-'-'-'-'-'-' -'-'-'-'-'-' It's a man who's out,

1008
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:52,031
but their portion will be material receiving as well as generating

1009
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:55,023
no less entrusting the goods. So,

1010
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:58,540
you guys will have the tablet out there. If a load comes in,

1011
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:02,351
you can pull up the purchase order. See what items arrive with quantities.

1012
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:04,716
You can mark and proceed as it comes in.

1013
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:07,960
And then, fall back it is as- .

1014
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:12,676
So, you'll have your available leading there

1015
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:16,684
and say, why don't you just say- you know,

1016
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:20,617
man, you have a key member in there that proceeds and is on his

1017
00:57:20,618 --> 00:57:22,693
call and then it's just interceded.

1018
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:27,510
He can then- all of those PDFs to associate all of the C numbers

1019
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:30,307
so that we can still do our activity for Trello.

1020
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:32,612
Excuse me, please let him happen. Bye. Yeah, this,

1021
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:36,142
and they're going in to speak to me, you know,

1022
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:38,459
and so this is only a basic or terrible thing.

1023
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,270
You know, it doesn't be this diverse. Yes. So it'll all make free

1024
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:47,909
set. Yeah, every first start of the lead issue gives

1025
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:51,391
the. And the list of what they're needed.

1026
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:56,056
And they also get which we should be some more nervous now.

1027
00:57:56,057 --> 00:58:00,578
So,

1028
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,844
we'll learn the shop page.

1029
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:07,081
We track the same length through here. All right. Um,

1030
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:10,450
I think they're working towards issuing type of videos from other people.

1031
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:15,513
Um. Bye That portion we haven't really discussed.

1032
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:20,004
Um, we don't really have anything broke up in inventory or anything in the

1033
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:22,132
size database. Peace. Or paint,

1034
00:58:22,606 --> 00:58:25,485
some of them have done some kind of, uh, uhm,

1035
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:27,502
the inventory at this point.

1036
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:30,942
Talk about fillets. All right. All right. Try, basically,

1037
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:33,103
look over here, you know, how many, down,

1038
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,138
and look, look, look, look, look,

1039
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:36,514
look, look, look, look.

1040
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:44,835
Yeah, so we did our best to be able to able to get into

1041
00:58:44,836 --> 00:58:47,042
this. And then we break down the island,

1042
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:51,035
we see in there, uhm, which is incredibly relevant for our steel purchases.

1043
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:52,733
Then it goes into our inventory. Thanks for coming on this week's video. Thanks

1044
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:56,108
for Try. Thank you coming on this week's video.

1045
00:58:56,109 --> 00:58:58,115
Uh, we keep, however,

1046
00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:01,036
with the paint portion, there's none and hold it.

1047
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,639
There's no pieceface that I brought you out in here,

1048
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,751
and it's, you know, we're gonna most definitely put it in there.

1049
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,738
If we don't want to always be getting- you can buy it again on

1050
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:13,737
the bales of this piece back, and you can go,

1051
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:17,051
um, buy it again on the bale of the ice.

1052
00:59:21,632 --> 00:59:22,868
And then, um, front to see show me the billions, and then you can

1053
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:25,031
go into a purchase order online.

1054
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:30,031
You

1055
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:38,000
would be limited to the point of, we used one,

1056
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:41,051
one gallon of disfibing, and then I'm going to have to pour it in.

1057
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,482
It comes out, there's no way to quantify that,

1058
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:47,242
and it was a mere headache. It needs to come in garbage science,

1059
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:51,626
not anything is bad at the end. Yeah. What about you guys doing this?

1060
00:59:51,627 --> 00:59:53,784
Umm, it's an easy video you said.

1061
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:56,277
I'm taking shape or something like that. But,

1062
00:59:56,777 --> 01:00:00,079
what? You I've been hitting me in that during this very day.

1063
01:00:00,498 --> 01:00:03,666
Let's say I've had a lot of time down in the room,

1064
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,908
so we've got a primer. I don't I don't think I've ever had it.

1065
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:10,223
As I pull one out of storage, and bring it into the market,

1066
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:13,031
I'm going to get this thing, so I don't know.

1067
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:16,282
The storage must have one full one down, and perhaps start using it.

1068
01:00:16,774 --> 01:00:18,943
But, you know what you've got in storage, and of course,

1069
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:21,076
it wasn't happening really loose. Thank very much.

1070
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:23,578
Rather than having to track, I've shopped,

1071
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:28,449
pointed to get a little bit, so I didn't, umm, to check where I

1072
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,703
went. I will see here all the time. Here are my questions.

1073
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:35,534
Yeah, let's do something we'll do and,

1074
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:38,177
uhh. 7 That one would be,

1075
01:00:38,178 --> 01:00:40,463
umm,

1076
01:00:40,464 --> 01:00:43,030
uhh, quite simple process to do,

1077
01:00:43,031 --> 01:00:45,071
so, perfect. All right.

1078
01:00:45,072 --> 01:00:47,734
All right. Yeah, we've been talking a little bit about this.

1079
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:50,824
So let's see if I can go in the piece.

1080
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:54,058
It's gonna be it. Yeah. Uh, no, no.

1081
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,782
no, no,

1082
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:04,348
I have it in, um, if you got eight to the other twelve,

1083
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:06,702
you just type in one of an e-game,

1084
01:01:06,815 --> 01:01:09,071
and you're buying them, it won't save twenty, it won't save twenty.

1085
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:12,813
And then that total quantity will go to twelve,

1086
01:01:12,814 --> 01:01:17,361
or whatever your difference is. and we'll see you just

1087
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:21,202
go back in here, and you can receive a whole item,

1088
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:25,091
or you can receive a portion of a whole item.

1089
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:27,304
So, I can, I can,

1090
01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:30,872
uh, show you what they're on.

1091
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:35,966
you So,

1092
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:37,992
all over and over and over again, please come back to me.

1093
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:42,934
Thank Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

1094
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:47,221
Thank you very much.

1095
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:51,796
very much. Thank you very much.

1096
01:01:51,797 --> 01:01:56,527
It will probably be

1097
01:01:56,528 --> 01:01:59,870
my party in the next week or whatever,

1098
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:03,092
so we'll sign up for everybody in the beginning of the week.

1099
01:02:03,402 --> 01:02:06,071
I'll go through the IT, get a list of guys that don't need it.

1100
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,994
Again, again, that don't have a list of business signage,

1101
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:11,770
and we'll get all of that set up and then try it in a

1102
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:14,111
little bit of video. This is what,

1103
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:16,864
and one on five, everyone's going to be entering,

1104
01:02:17,036 --> 01:02:20,444
receding, shaping, and instead of smacking my rhythm.

1105
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,109
You welcome. Okay,

1106
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,900
so I'm going to do that, but I'm not going to do that. You

1107
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,497
guys you're up.

1108
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:29,715
Uh, you guys shouldn't have to do any of that. Umm,

1109
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:32,927
you're going to realize it's not interacting with your, your construct or everything.

1110
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:35,298
So that's all, that's all a circuit instance.

1111
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:38,105
Umm, I think you guys are really good at it.

1112
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:42,655
So unless somebody, you know, may I specifically request that they want your time

1113
01:02:42,656 --> 01:02:46,096
to act into the untyped part of the universe's plan.

1114
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:48,692
But, uh,

1115
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:51,257
we do our contract in the ear for the shock side,

1116
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:53,391
and, uh, we do do that all the time, so go, go, go,

1117
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:58,201
go, go, and then try to eat everything for hours and use to begin

1118
01:02:58,202 --> 01:03:00,598
to properly sail. So, um,

1119
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:02,676
you guys can have your own service. But it's,

1120
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:05,566
it's, you know, a lot of it's going to be,

1121
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:08,876
I'm trying to watch, I'm just going to watch some of that one way,

1122
01:03:08,877 --> 01:03:13,581
some, some of the- So, uhm,

1123
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:18,136
I guess everybody has their own weird way of doing this.

1124
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:21,586
They're compromised, they're temp employees, they don't aim them through this,

1125
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:23,905
uh, they're their own server. Our entity,

1126
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:26,171
uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

1127
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:29,292
The other guy, folks, is pretty much sour at that point.

1128
01:03:29,293 --> 01:03:31,410
Uh, let me see the exception, I can't believe it was cheap.

1129
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:34,699
And, um, he's MediRoute, he won't drink with his- in the biscuit,

1130
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,986
like, uhm, amongst the other guy.

1131
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:40,310
He and Alan, they'll try, try,

1132
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:42,531
try with the tekwa. I love you. I you.

1133
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:46,237
I love you. I love you.

1134
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:50,171
I love you.

1135
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:52,634
I love bringing, ah, you guys doing all the visuals,

1136
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,121
because that's one thing that this doesn't show is all the additional time,

1137
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:58,151
so shitting hours and getting to the living room.

1138
01:03:58,152 --> 01:04:01,515
I love you, ah, these guys, if you're convinced that they actually go to

1139
01:04:01,516 --> 01:04:04,341
the living room, I love you. So, it came through us,

1140
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:06,862
of course you're not gonna be able to- All right. So, enough of this,

1141
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:11,219
uh, this cover doesn't mind if the volume,

1142
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,313
right? It's gonna give the masses, kind of, it's having trouble.

1143
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:15,407
I think it's where we need- to go, but currently,

1144
01:04:15,408 --> 01:04:18,703
right now, when we're done, it's multiple systems.

1145
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:22,039
We've got a certain volume in the body, your collection will know what- All

1146
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,651
right. Oh, darling, it's just going to look forward to close,

1147
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:29,524
right now. So, ah,

1148
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:33,440
but- you And now I'm out shooting with your against the person who will

1149
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:35,594
arrive. Uh, I can't believe it all.

1150
01:04:36,891 --> 01:04:39,237
Yeah, I'm in here. You Yeah, it,

1151
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:42,873
it, I don't see a lot. They have to be injured.

1152
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:46,180
Um, the question is if we get- .

1153
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:51,180
But

1154
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:54,079
if it's sound like a majority of the app, if you're going with it.

1155
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,256
you Yeah, with a drawer in the house,

1156
01:04:59,257 --> 01:05:01,458
and the only area where it would be,

1157
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:04,868
um. All right. And oh I'm a little All right. Or we created additional

1158
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:08,310
work that's added in the projects that are telling our steep production.

1159
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:11,438
All the impression people it is. . They're all production data,

1160
01:05:11,764 --> 01:05:13,910
shitting, cuz they see a little bit of an animal quest,

1161
01:05:14,236 --> 01:05:17,479
different and oddball things, where they're just taking something new,

1162
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,979
taking something new. Nolke. So then we'd have to add all the good jobs

1163
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,746
in the nearage so that they have the ability to try it and it's

1164
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:25,852
um, same thing with codeings. Thanks for watching.

1165
01:05:25,853 --> 01:05:29,475
See time. However, being a little bit more prevalent because they're trying to keep

1166
01:05:29,476 --> 01:05:32,133
the tracking, uhm, shipping is uh,

1167
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:34,211
really weird. in your opinion.

1168
01:05:34,212 --> 01:05:36,834
I to me, we are a lot of that.

1169
01:05:36,835 --> 01:05:40,643
So you're really being able to be shipping over the whole day.

1170
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,536
And it's not- Bye. It's not time to use the second job,

1171
01:05:44,537 --> 01:05:48,848
it's what I'm hearing. It's just a- Ops that it's just a little spread

1172
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:50,231
in today. Okay.

1173
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:56,751
It's just spread out with a ball jump, is that how it's going to

1174
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,787
go? Okay. Kelsk,

1175
01:05:59,406 --> 01:06:02,474
Are you guys going to get too tough now? They went fast,

1176
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:05,382
and now they're in Georgia up into Johnson.

1177
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:10,251
Too tough. Go. And then, you what? But it is a beast that we're

1178
01:06:10,252 --> 01:06:12,340
talking about in last couple months,

1179
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:15,217
isn't it? It's darn pretty, it was just a- It's a game over here,

1180
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:17,826
it's true, it's a bit over that thousand shot.

1181
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:21,391
I'll see you up. Okay. So,

1182
01:06:21,392 --> 01:06:25,766
no. Bye bye. and an envelope for your recent portion of the unit in

1183
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:31,036
this inventory module. So. No.

1184
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:33,071
When you open the inventory module,

1185
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,716
you'll have all of these action available for you.

1186
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,738
You're gonna probably just be able to move over, take some stock.

1187
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:41,567
Bye-bye. This, if you need a point, uhm,

1188
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,617
once Chris Chief puts his plan together,

1189
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:46,052
then we put lines in the yard,

1190
01:06:46,053 --> 01:06:48,668
and then we cut bins. Uh, that's where you remove the functions going to

1191
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:51,187
be. Incredibly useful.

1192
01:06:51,188 --> 01:06:55,737
If you guys want to with one

1193
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:59,510
project to the name of the community, because a bigger project came in and

1194
01:06:59,866 --> 01:07:02,988
the availability here is going to be better and you want to look and

1195
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:06,172
shop. I saw things around me. If you want something on here,

1196
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:09,748
update the inventory location, you want it in the stop,

1197
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:14,023
operators that you saw. Bye bye. That inventory location updates on their cut list,

1198
01:07:14,354 --> 01:07:16,955
and they can see where the steel is at that point.

1199
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,395
So, let's get rid of what was going on right now. Yup.

1200
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:25,076
So, uhm, in the future, both function will be super helpful once

1201
01:07:25,077 --> 01:07:27,196
we have a very good plan in place. Thank you.

1202
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:30,514
For the whilst in the dedicated encodings,

1203
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:34,574
what's gonna be where for steel, because they are the many rows.

1204
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:35,171
those.

1205
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,860
function, we have our old categories for what I have,

1206
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:49,083
which we might have in our, that's,

1207
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:53,387
where do I go in the middle of it. It's good. So, uhm,

1208
01:07:53,398 --> 01:07:57,908
the taken stop portion that you guys shouldn't really have to use,

1209
01:07:57,909 --> 01:08:01,843
uhm, test. . I would be more prevalent in the lines of,

1210
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:06,800
I feel like I came in with under six foot or eight foot pieces.

1211
01:08:06,801 --> 01:08:09,077
Please be, material, E-Verify,

1212
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:13,326
then he can escape it, and confirm with us that it's not allocated to

1213
01:08:13,327 --> 01:08:16,257
a project, you can then go, If the tape comes up,

1214
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,245
it's fine, that's six-o-piece. Hit tape from the stop.

1215
01:08:19,545 --> 01:08:22,239
That should also be the exception to the bullet onto the load,

1216
01:08:22,496 --> 01:08:24,893
or just a, Rightly yank it out of the system,

1217
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,998
but it's not gonna track any more and they take it loaded up and

1218
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:31,211
it's, So, go ahead and look.

1219
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:34,362
That means a functioned tagline that you guys track.

1220
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,889
Mhm. Who does the handling?

1221
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:39,251
It's a checking and receiving, or isn't it?

1222
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:42,319
. . . Well, it's . . . It's more of a faceted,

1223
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,876
uhh, my song operator is picking it up from the yard,

1224
01:08:44,877 --> 01:08:48,132
picking up the song, and then we'll pass it by us handling And then

1225
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:51,336
by sort of the fabricating material into the,

1226
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:54,133
uhh, the shop, what I'm gonna solve.

1227
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:57,007
Whoa. And that's the part that's happening here.

1228
01:08:58,094 --> 01:09:01,621
But it's not a ship that perceives a ship. It doesn't. So that's all

1229
01:09:01,622 --> 01:09:04,029
shop camp. We did it now. That's right. It doesn't have any tone with

1230
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:07,095
it there. I don't know if this will be applied to you.

1231
01:09:07,096 --> 01:09:09,480
Okay. And we're usually two weeks behind, and this is so,

1232
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:14,625
I don't get a full synopsis. an office. So you guys

1233
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:18,264
have a lot of guys trained to try to afford this.

1234
01:09:18,265 --> 01:09:19,276
So

1235
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,013
it's a very sugary quality of a shot, but it's, you know, even the

1236
01:09:25,014 --> 01:09:27,256
other specs, you know. Okay.

1237
01:09:27,257 --> 01:09:32,694
. Yes, sir. So, um, you went on to the next category

1238
01:09:32,695 --> 01:09:35,291
of the boat. Uh, this would be.

1239
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:38,251
We're in a prenatal modulus.

1240
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:43,271
You can take that load portion and physically- You

1241
01:09:43,272 --> 01:09:47,499
Load the items onto the truck, set against the four loudest three loads of

1242
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,772
the system. So we can go in here and kinda show you.

1243
01:09:50,773 --> 01:09:53,689
You uhm,

1244
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,680
we can have a few Thank you.

1245
01:10:00,131 --> 01:10:04,027
So,

1246
01:10:04,028 --> 01:10:08,654
let me throw, like, a whole thing until they can go in

1247
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:13,304
it. . . and add each member as they're blooming it on the truck.

1248
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:17,051
Yup. And that would then build a separate little list of..

1249
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:19,584
Yeah, I mean, that's for you. It's not a good,

1250
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:21,956
good, good truck, but it's not a good truck.

1251
01:10:21,957 --> 01:10:26,690
Anyways, there's, uhh, uhh, checkbox there and I've

1252
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:28,925
left you a quarter of it. I'll move on so,

1253
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:32,987
do you mind check that? Consistent so you can create a place.

1254
01:10:32,988 --> 01:10:35,128
What I They think about something loaded, loaded,

1255
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:37,762
loaded at least, loaded at least, loaded at least.

1256
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:41,176
Okay, this right here is what I'm getting into tat.

1257
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:49,151
I can slap that. Yeah, this is what I can do. Okay.

1258
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:52,402
We're moving to the doors already to the job.

1259
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:57,388
Yeah. After adding up the image shipping portion of the project to the- No

1260
01:10:57,389 --> 01:11:01,697
unloading. If you- if you pre-plug the whole type of your talking,

1261
01:11:01,698 --> 01:11:05,171
uh, the thing's safe. Which is not always- guys.

1262
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:08,910
But always, uh,

1263
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:10,924
I think you'd have something to do with that. I guess,

1264
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:13,156
if I can go play by the lead.

1265
01:11:13,157 --> 01:11:16,749
. . Okay, but we go to siblings that have wonky,

1266
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,980
you know, figurations and they just don't wind up the way.

1267
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:22,597
You don't have to go, right? Yeah, I don't have to bathe my work,

1268
01:11:22,598 --> 01:11:25,030
but, you know, like, I'm just sticking out of there.

1269
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:28,450
Or it's too tall, so you have to fold it. Yeah.

1270
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:33,265
So. you can do that. I highly suggest

1271
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:35,434
you start using the shipping back on your unit.

1272
01:11:35,788 --> 01:11:38,527
It's not pre-built in short. Bye. At least here next Friday.

1273
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:43,417
Right. Then, I usually try to get rid of the organization of it and

1274
01:11:43,418 --> 01:11:47,606
the guys at B.R. to say good. I don't care if I'm not going

1275
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:50,367
shoot a few weeks from the end of it. What's your tomorrow?

1276
01:11:50,368 --> 01:11:53,236
I see you on P****, the living on calendar. I'm outta here.

1277
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:55,873
I'm here. I hold it up. That'd be my list. I'm ready to get

1278
01:11:56,246 --> 01:11:59,357
my, get my, get my, get my, get my, get the boat. And so,

1279
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:03,336
get worse off the calendar. down here. Which means you a lot more in

1280
01:12:03,337 --> 01:12:06,197
a mission. So, basically really,

1281
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:08,919
really nice. So. And I think if you want to schedule it.

1282
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,665
Good morning. I mean,

1283
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:13,731
shipping is going to need to be part of it.

1284
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:18,973
I mean, we would have such a- massive backlog and that we're,

1285
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:23,218
you know, shipping guys everywhere and we just didn't have the resources to put

1286
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:32,147
on the trucks. Yeah. There I

1287
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:35,176
want to face it. And then can it quite be a lot more?

1288
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:38,513
I'm just going to look at it. So, I'm going to do the inventory.

1289
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:41,573
I'm going to see the portion of it. This is already ready to see

1290
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:44,218
here. You can see your video volume here.

1291
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:48,175
This will represent your videos,

1292
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:51,325
what's included on it. Perfect. And then this is where you can,

1293
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:54,961
you can dial in your quantities, type in your view number,

1294
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:57,712
and then click received.

1295
01:12:57,713 --> 01:13:02,749
up. That will receive in four with that heat

1296
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,475
downer, and once you do that,

1297
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:06,679
the three remaining stubby out there, you can enter that heat number. We see,

1298
01:13:07,022 --> 01:13:10,055
and then we'll walk with that computer, and we'll see if I know what's

1299
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:12,586
going on over here. Now if you're new. So,

1300
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,237
on the load side. Bye. Hey, my name is Scott.

1301
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:17,724
So, paper and stock, and it's not right on the list,

1302
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:20,283
and they're just being here from the yard, and it's milling,

1303
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:25,292
then taking the stock. The stock will pull it from the inventory

1304
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:30,011
as well, but it's where you can visit the load inventory in the yard.

1305
01:13:30,012 --> 01:13:32,745
. I don't know what load. And ship that up,

1306
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:37,255
receive is where you're going, and this is where you can come and steal

1307
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:42,295
your entry. So you experience the amount of orders that show the

1308
01:13:42,296 --> 01:13:45,510
materials that are coming in by purchase order.

1309
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:47,823
I'm not sure. I'm not interested in it,

1310
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,100
and you can receive those items in it.

1311
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:52,618
And, uh, click receive down below.

1312
01:13:52,914 --> 01:13:57,319
This will be updated in minutes. I a time of this item came in,

1313
01:13:57,927 --> 01:14:01,829
this is the heat number, and then the operator instantly knows it had to

1314
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,291
stop. Uh, hey, this is here, this is received in,

1315
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,181
and I just need to find out where it is,

1316
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:12,157
and once we establish the- the location is in a good line of the

1317
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,902
hour that we're going to be, then you guys can add in.

1318
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:20,106
So, like, here. Thank you. Umm,

1319
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:24,222
you can assign your location, and then you'll search your location,

1320
01:14:24,574 --> 01:14:27,495
and then that'll update. Okay. Okay. On the outreach,

1321
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,167
Atlas, this is in this area,

1322
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:34,265
and then they all, they just came in and built it.

1323
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:37,016
They didn't post on the end of the cell that we saw before.

1324
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:39,768
They're reaching out to us before they're going to go down over there,

1325
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:42,311
so I mean, that's that, you might need to put it.

1326
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:45,411
So, do the family guys,

1327
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:47,901
uh, the shock guys that are moving things,

1328
01:14:48,472 --> 01:14:52,450
the vital location where they put the, things in the system.

1329
01:14:53,373 --> 01:14:55,391
So, if they're not done running,

1330
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,095
I'm not really supposed to say finish good.

1331
01:14:57,908 --> 01:15:00,148
Good. Comes out practically,

1332
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:03,624
it's sitting out in the yard somewhere, uhm,

1333
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:06,311
but the handling guy from the shop did it.

1334
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,536
There's no, there's no heat and fabrication, location and separation.

1335
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:17,231
So how does the shimmy guy know? You can get everything that's complete and

1336
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:20,289
reduction before taking the police station,

1337
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:22,077
the center area or the shops. What does that I'll stop. After that. Does

1338
01:15:22,078 --> 01:15:25,784
that mean it's okay? And anything that is complete from commings,

1339
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:29,655
it's staged in a completion area in the center of the yard.

1340
01:15:29,656 --> 01:15:31,925
part of the video. . . And then we'll go back to the beginning

1341
01:15:31,926 --> 01:15:35,728
part. . . . are saying basically that you can be with working across

1342
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:38,296
those areas for each. Yeah, essentially.

1343
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:40,701
Yeah, essentially Tinted into those shots, uhh,

1344
01:15:40,711 --> 01:15:45,041
that's either completion from Motion and .

1345
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:46,331
. they're going out on whill

1346
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,423
and then anything that's completing between the stereo, the current stereo and toadings So

1347
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:57,035
I'm completely, going to go out on a trail.

1348
01:15:57,036 --> 01:16:00,037
How do you prepare next to jobs?

1349
01:16:00,038 --> 01:16:02,217
I'm a great dad. Have a good day.

1350
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:05,744
You know, if it's a large sequence, a reporter law will give you a

1351
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:08,317
really good identification,

1352
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,331
but typically, we have all our data tags.

1353
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,722
It'll, uh, form our QC that should have those jobs.

1354
01:16:13,723 --> 01:16:16,504
You can slot each one, and then they're going through,

1355
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,021
based off of the list of these guys. But you better,

1356
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:22,132
and you don't want them to run any, but it can't be sent over.

1357
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:24,519
We're going to get by it, and then we'll go that way.

1358
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:28,316
See you later then. Goodnight. I mean,

1359
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:32,019
facility's small. It's two working on four acres,

1360
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,331
so I guess I better not get lost here.

1361
01:16:34,332 --> 01:16:36,504
Right. Yeah, that's,

1362
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:38,713
yeah, that's better. We're seeing,

1363
01:16:38,714 --> 01:16:41,256
you know, these, uh, play balls, uh, ballad, and friend of tasey.

1364
01:16:41,257 --> 01:16:43,312
Go ahead. Good. I'm glad. Sure.

1365
01:16:43,528 --> 01:16:46,845
Thanks. Thank you. Good. So,

1366
01:16:46,846 --> 01:16:49,423
this inventory is on the whole screen.

1367
01:16:49,424 --> 01:16:54,380
Yeah. Yeah. Inventory risk is where you're gonna go for

1368
01:16:54,381 --> 01:16:56,890
moving things, taking things from stock,

1369
01:16:57,106 --> 01:17:04,030
loading things, loading raw steel. Thank So that will be the main governing

1370
01:17:04,031 --> 01:17:07,091
portion of the house.

1371
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:09,346
Both your order does,

1372
01:17:09,347 --> 01:17:11,761
it should be received by personnel. Um,

1373
01:17:11,772 --> 01:17:15,136
in addition to that, you'll also have this.

1374
01:17:15,137 --> 01:17:17,263
. Work packages, portion, uhm,

1375
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:19,503
work packages, projects, uhm,

1376
01:17:19,513 --> 01:17:21,821
anything that's going to be out of less room, if that's enough,

1377
01:17:22,207 --> 01:17:24,226
it's going to end in work time. I don't know,

1378
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:27,121
so that's probably the best place for you to look at.

1379
01:17:27,122 --> 01:17:30,678
It's going to grow in a way, uhm,

1380
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,211
weave.

1381
01:17:35,588 --> 01:17:40,226
So, that's- creation is how you can ship. I would be your

1382
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:43,388
best reference is to go get into work that good news.

1383
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:46,640
Umm, can we ship every world for the landowner yet?

1384
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:49,325
I love them. Okay,

1385
01:17:49,326 --> 01:17:52,495
so I hope that,

1386
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:54,381
you know, because I've rebuilt all of the loads for that landowner. We'll in

1387
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:54,685
the one.

1388
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:05,546
So,

1389
01:18:05,802 --> 01:18:08,830
we have all of our work packages in here, um,

1390
01:18:08,841 --> 01:18:13,398
you'll click into your sequence, and then- and here in your shipping category

1391
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:18,677
is where you can reference anything associated

1392
01:18:18,956 --> 01:18:23,384
with your bill. So we can see here that we've got one load,

1393
01:18:23,472 --> 01:18:26,487
load 19. That's not started yet.

1394
01:18:27,076 --> 01:18:31,452
Thank you. . I'm looking at this load, and this would be where you

1395
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:34,230
can make the designation of,

1396
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:37,031
uhm. . Removing,

1397
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:39,679
adding additional, uhm,

1398
01:18:39,689 --> 01:18:41,926
could have been blown about, that's really, really nice.

1399
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:45,869
you just check where she wants you to be blown.

1400
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,789
No parents, stop, appear,

1401
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,061
or if you need to remove it from the load because- It Some items

1402
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:57,017
not gonna fit. If you remove this from the load because it's not gonna

1403
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:59,460
fit, my computer will update- Okay.

1404
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:03,469
What? Didn't shit. And then when you get smart with this shit,

1405
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:08,394
it updates everything and it'll put it back and it's- I can raise it

1406
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:12,622
to a new load and then we can now transfer a track unit from

1407
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,731
what went out and we didn't go out and explain it.

1408
01:19:15,732 --> 01:19:17,759
I'm going to send a lot. So, you know,

1409
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:20,742
sort of crease of that shit, right? It's like, where the deal would set

1410
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:23,349
me, right? Yeah. And you're looking for D-None.

1411
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:26,324
Bye-bye. Pick the little part meat symbol over there,

1412
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:28,663
or whatever that symbol really reminds of.

1413
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,811
That is y'all's station that's supposed to be- No.

1414
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:36,390
Okay,

1415
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:37,942
well, everything's been thinned up. Two of them have been well in it. You

1416
01:19:37,943 --> 01:19:40,960
know that new- . We're getting figured out.

1417
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:43,028
Here we have a- . . is best shit, Mars.

1418
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,041
Go get knowin' about it. Though, if you want to go in the whole

1419
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,106
shop, you can kinda at least see you in a- Yeah.

1420
01:19:48,155 --> 01:19:55,129
Yeah. Well,

1421
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:55,323
I have a nice time here at sites where you should go and break

1422
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:58,250
the source that I need. The reason which we're looking for is it could

1423
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,854
be a deviant 8x28 with 3 clips or 5 clips.

1424
01:20:01,855 --> 01:20:04,845
Oops. See,

1425
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:07,905
you're a bender scrub, it's ruined. I'm just saying,

1426
01:20:07,906 --> 01:20:11,516
the shipping guys are always telling me to load the trucks.

1427
01:20:11,781 --> 01:20:15,737
I'm gonna- unless the order is consolidated by somebody that either dedicates an area

1428
01:20:15,738 --> 01:20:17,835
or whatever, the shipping guys don't.

1429
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,645
There's so much that you can add to the movement. We'll see you in

1430
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:23,543
a minute. But they don't really know exactly what the piece looks like.

1431
01:20:23,544 --> 01:20:27,398
There's lots of pieces that look really similar. And then you get the wrong

1432
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:30,714
piece on the wrong piece. And I've seen them just having more than I'd

1433
01:20:30,715 --> 01:20:34,984
like to. Yeah, they're really smart, so yeah. But you know what I'll say,

1434
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:39,511
they might be smart now. I have not even

1435
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:42,529
had that area where these more packages will really help,

1436
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,546
you know, because they're in here. Thank you. And they're trying to look at

1437
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:48,671
everything, umm, once I figure out why I earned the virus,

1438
01:20:48,672 --> 01:20:51,784
I can't get it at this point. I don't know how it gets to

1439
01:20:51,785 --> 01:20:55,549
the bottom. Come I how it that when you do it this week.

1440
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:58,736
Maybe they'll put it on over the end today, uhh, but they can always

1441
01:20:58,737 --> 01:21:01,422
pull this up and have you very clear reference.

1442
01:21:01,692 --> 01:21:04,356
Unlike for a B5, I'll shoot it at 60 for the long.

1443
01:21:04,357 --> 01:21:06,572
This thing should stand out, so I'm up here.

1444
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:09,261
Let's go ahead and show it. And then, And uh,

1445
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,371
I mean, they can go right back to their,

1446
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:15,217
uhm, shipping items.

1447
01:21:15,646 --> 01:21:18,333
And then go, Go back into their glove.

1448
01:21:18,433 --> 01:21:21,779
Okay. Yep. I have a B9.

1449
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,833
Yeah. And this will show the length.

1450
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:27,478
Bye. Umm, but it's only in the shot of length in the main number.

1451
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:30,374
So, if the main number is spliced,

1452
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,683
you'll be sub-part to a- Actually,

1453
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:36,775
you're told the length, that might not always be the exact,

1454
01:21:37,472 --> 01:21:40,344
you know, if you've done a six-year-old in a day to end the- Thank

1455
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:44,715
you. I said third, but he was a third-year-old with 20-year-olds?

1456
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:47,152
Yeah. So, so that is,

1457
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:49,669
You helpful to assert,

1458
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:52,415
says, but once you start getting rid of the really big stuff,

1459
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:56,531
um, unless the main member is specifically,

1460
01:21:56,532 --> 01:21:58,659
detailed out as that full length,

1461
01:21:59,031 --> 01:22:01,378
and we run it as a splice package in here,

1462
01:22:01,536 --> 01:22:04,576
and you keep that raw length, the full length. And again.

1463
01:22:04,577 --> 01:22:09,081
For this one, umm, the detail package anticipated a

1464
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:12,296
splice, so the main number was actually a sub.

1465
01:22:12,297 --> 01:22:14,733
So. A portion of your full length. So,

1466
01:22:14,734 --> 01:22:18,589
umm, there is a way for us to leave a main number,

1467
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:22,426
add a full length, and create a splice. A splice package and splice the

1468
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:24,966
parts together to keep that main number length that way.

1469
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:28,126
Yeah, so don't always be like this. That's a big mess.

1470
01:22:28,127 --> 01:22:30,477
It has no- . . I'm not singing with the trucks but he wants

1471
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,627
this, that wants to turn the parts together. Okay.

1472
01:22:32,869 --> 01:22:35,240
The name of the cousin will be Kim Snowman.

1473
01:22:35,662 --> 01:22:37,669
So, So. Well, uhm,

1474
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:42,265
it'll be project by project basis, but then it will be over the best

1475
01:22:42,266 --> 01:22:44,776
recognizability, projects and events. Thanks.

1476
01:22:44,777 --> 01:22:47,682
So, but you can pull up all these different things.

1477
01:22:47,683 --> 01:22:49,925
You guys will have visibility tunes in here.

1478
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:52,217
And, and you guys can see.

1479
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,869
Bye. I have a lot of of work and everything.

1480
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:58,068
What's it where it turns? Can you can go,

1481
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:02,359
uhh, back to here? You back to your overview,

1482
01:23:02,701 --> 01:23:05,633
assemblies, uhh, material status,

1483
01:23:05,634 --> 01:23:08,496
showing status, and uh,

1484
01:23:08,507 --> 01:23:12,236
let's see. I'm going be one day. Dashboards.

1485
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:16,669
I'm going to go to our shipping camp there. This is what we're going

1486
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:21,508
to- Thank very much. We have

1487
01:23:21,509 --> 01:23:24,971
all of them on here.

1488
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:27,050
And then, once we've heard our chat,

1489
01:23:27,051 --> 01:23:29,561
we have a seat request to have all three of them fully set up

1490
01:23:29,562 --> 01:23:32,366
a ton of glue over to one week. I brad it them,

1491
01:23:32,367 --> 01:23:36,184
dr- Dray. They're already built in there,

1492
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:41,045
everything's very needed to be, so I just started bringing pre-organizing for the-

1493
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:44,218
You guys are in here, and you know something's not in the ship,

1494
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:47,662
umm, so. I think that's where- uh,

1495
01:23:47,672 --> 01:23:49,816
bring the level up. You think about it,

1496
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:54,326
and bring up the legend. So the origin

1497
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:56,917
of the product risk, Loom, is central,

1498
01:23:56,918 --> 01:23:59,207
but- . . . you've seen Zero-Shaded in the bottom?

1499
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:02,841
Yeah. That Zero-Shaded says, Peace and Better Plan for that job,

1500
01:24:02,842 --> 01:24:05,000
and that doesn't mean a lot of it yet. So.

1501
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:07,655
Bye! Whereas the orange can be there as an ownership player.

1502
01:24:07,656 --> 01:24:09,777
Um, and they've got green,

1503
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,024
which is, it's already shaded in Maria that was supposed to be shaded in

1504
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:15,906
Maria. It's your persona. So, that's why I didn't mark it.

1505
01:24:17,894 --> 01:24:20,920
So, uhm, from here, uhm, you know, tomorrow's in 12.

1506
01:24:20,803 --> 01:24:23,004
Well, Excellent schedule.

1507
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:25,712
Nothing's been loaded. Nothing's been confirmed.

1508
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:28,389
You can go in here, reschedule.

1509
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:31,985
Push this Go on a day if you needed to. Push it through Monday.

1510
01:24:31,986 --> 01:24:34,288
And then, if you're going here,

1511
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,571
just populate back down here. And- And then,

1512
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:43,316
the visibility quality there for everybody involved on it.

1513
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:46,293
Or give it a sexy rating, but- I don't if you should write it,

1514
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:49,963
you'll be there. I'm going to say this for now.

1515
01:24:50,226 --> 01:24:54,069
Who's the last of me, Sk Shilid.

1516
01:24:57,048 --> 01:25:00,503
So, yeah, it's not the length of the helmet,

1517
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:05,045
it's a transport. So, this would be

1518
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:09,551
nice for,

1519
01:25:09,552 --> 01:25:11,985
I'm having a good communication with Hey, what's your own,

1520
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:13,992
and what's your own next day, what's your own Monday?

1521
01:25:14,592 --> 01:25:16,460
This, come on. It's a good, it's a good, it's it's a it's a

1522
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:19,896
thing. This will be it. I have every communication home for that thing.

1523
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:23,084
You better be impacted while your int is, when this person is good.

1524
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:25,747
How does it feel, guys, though? What's coming in- The thing is,

1525
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:26,680
can I use this counter? You're welcome.

1526
01:25:33,611 --> 01:25:38,153
Hopefully

1527
01:25:38,154 --> 01:25:43,425
right. You So,

1528
01:25:43,426 --> 01:25:46,175
honestly, typically we'll set during our kickoff,

1529
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:50,411
we schedule the current date that goes as expected by the bill poll winner.

1530
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:54,584
Umm, if there are any changes that the bill is born in,

1531
01:25:54,612 --> 01:25:56,867
or the project manager, or that child,

1532
01:25:56,868 --> 01:25:59,437
would reach out to each and the shooting man. I'm sure I know the

1533
01:25:59,592 --> 01:26:02,056
rest of the time. Uh,

1534
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:05,422
did salary mixing up, or did we have to make sure that we're on

1535
01:26:05,423 --> 01:26:07,464
par and meet that kid? Are they talking to you,

1536
01:26:07,465 --> 01:26:09,532
the field, construction guy like yourself,

1537
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:11,878
the back kid, and then the top of the knee. They're all up,

1538
01:26:11,879 --> 01:26:14,224
they'll talk and call for anything you need to say they don't put.

1539
01:26:14,225 --> 01:26:16,902
Good. If it's an accelerated jumping forward,

1540
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:19,961
or inward, then I'm going to communicate with us to see if we can

1541
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:22,391
hear about them. Goodnight. Yeah.

1542
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,091
Sometimes I attend recently, if they just communicate with Paul,

1543
01:26:25,171 --> 01:26:27,330
I hit on a rectangle, but if you pushed it out,

1544

1592
01:30:09,797 --> 01:30:11,919
media, but that's where I see it, so.

1593
01:30:13,005 --> 01:30:15,553
Yeah, I should have known what you're going to know. And I think there's

time. And you can scroll down into the magnet.

1603
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,839

1614
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:34,558
I've been having a jump, right? Yeah, it's only nice to sit in your

It's the Trello. Open the end. Give me one minute.

1622
01:31:59,537 --> 01:32:04,362

1623
01:32:04,398 --> 01:32:06,874
lee over your pocket shirt, it's a good standard.

Thank you. And if you want us to, I can tell you what we

1625
01:32:09,182 --> 01:32:10,992
need to do in a separate case. It's like to do a whole lot

1626
01:32:10,993 --> 01:32:13,773
of research about how to wear it. It's an actual word.

1627
01:32:13,911 --> 01:32:16,442
But, be eh, you know, I don't- I was going to show you how

1628
01:32:16,443 --> 01:32:18,561
to leave this in the morning and wear it for a moment.

1629
01:32:18,931 --> 01:32:21,235
Like, the guy is better at your painting,

1630
01:32:21,236 --> 01:32:23,592

See that magic, I'm going to get it back If you want to receive

1636

1637
01:32:43,468 --> 01:32:46,832

1638
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:49,466
You can hit me on my- And if you heard the personal options,

1639
01:32:49,467 --> 01:32:52,700
well, I'm not sure as if you had to pipe it in different parts.

1640
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:55,173
No, I'm just- I'll see you in the same show you're coming in.

1641
01:32:55,499 --> 01:32:57,943
Thank you. And as in the same time, you just go ahead and I'm

1642
01:32:57,944 --> 01:33:00,460
not going through it in there. So when I lock in,

1643
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:02,795
just push that and close it in. Yeah,

1644
01:33:02,796 --> 01:33:05,306
you were just- you were just- selected all the line lines,

1645
01:33:05,307 --> 01:33:08,185
but you remember me because they're unique or a lot of them.

1646
01:33:08,186 --> 01:33:10,743
Yeah. And then when you come back in,

1647
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:13,517
it'll be all the way and you could- Okay, so that does it for

1648
01:33:13,518 --> 01:33:15,880
all of a lot of notes, yes.

1649
01:33:16,059 --> 01:33:20,208
Also, say something next. Thanks for the time.

1650
01:33:20,209 --> 01:33:24,937
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then now let's go down the sheet.

1651
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:30,034
out of the head. So,

1652
01:33:30,035 --> 01:33:32,550
this is gone. They don't hear the, like,

1653
01:33:32,551 --> 01:33:35,931

1654
01:33:35,932 --> 01:33:45,479
Cheers! And

1655
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,057
then when they got the last one, it was a bit bigger after moving,

1656
01:33:48,058 --> 01:33:50,119
you know, and then it won't be in parts of detail on that.

1657
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,571
Yeah, once you guys started getting deeper into that.

1658
01:33:52,572 --> 01:33:55,035
Then you can go into your move tab.

1659
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:59,182
We're going to get in here. We can go ahead and make the weekend.

1660
01:33:59,183 --> 01:34:03,147
Okay. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. We're going to get a bit of patience.

01:34:24,611 --> 01:34:27,452
would be able to sign the location. So we already know,

1667
01:34:27,469 --> 01:34:30,084
and we got, we got all that steel that's going to go right here.

1668
01:34:30,218 --> 01:34:32,591
Here's what I did. Here's my section. He goes.

1669
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:35,286
And receive it, you know, right into that portion.

1670
01:34:35,654 --> 01:34:37,653
You know what I'm going to do in the books? If you have these

1671
01:34:37,658 --> 01:34:40,636
issues, they're all right. I'll be with the pain or the like that.

1672
01:34:40,637 --> 01:34:43,070
Breakout and have people over the years and pour in,

1673
01:34:43,071 --> 01:34:45,782
you know, the stories. Alright,

1674
01:34:45,783 --> 01:34:48,509
let's see. Let's see how the game's been made.

1675
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:51,255
And okay. Alright, I'm going to go up and see a lot of the

1676
01:34:51,256 --> 01:34:54,198
shoots over there. Now, I'm going to go over here and just make this,

1677
01:34:54,199 --> 01:34:56,480
uh, you know, a lot. Alright. So, and try.

1678
01:34:56,481 --> 01:35:00,412
Okay. So, let's try to get in mind, and I'm so early on this

1679
01:35:00,413 --> 01:35:04,071
week, plans to get tablets to do all the question I needed.

1680
01:35:04,072 --> 01:35:06,196
We need it. And by Friday and Wednesday week,

1681
01:35:06,488 --> 01:35:09,381
I'm gonna take a list of who we have as BPM,

1682
01:35:09,382 --> 01:35:11,423
your logins, and Thurgis, you know,

1683
01:35:11,424 --> 01:35:14,311
as you can do as you can. Mm. Mm. Mm.

1684
01:35:14,312 --> 01:35:18,983
Mm. Mm. Mm. to take it and make sure these cards can be closed

1685
01:35:18,984 --> 01:35:22,703
for their time, personality, and women. Mm. Mm.

1686
01:35:22,704 --> 01:35:23,418
Mm.

1687
01:35:28,696 --> 01:35:30,848
Create an email for them,

1688
01:35:31,044 --> 01:35:33,301
and you get to their audience still.

1689
01:35:33,464 --> 01:35:36,736
So not for no great children, but that's a good word.

1690
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:39,023
Alright, couple of people on team with us.

1691
01:35:39,286 --> 01:35:44,178
Now, so we love the portion. It is where you would love material.

1692
01:35:44,179 --> 01:35:46,817
That's the- In the US, there's some, yeah, no violence,

1693
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:51,110
or say, ah, we're calling him and he'll have a shipping order.

1694
01:35:51,202 --> 01:35:54,717
Or I'll just go over it for a minute. Bye bye. So, let's take

1695
01:35:54,718 --> 01:35:58,118
a line over the road, for example. You got that long load that you're

1696
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:00,949
looking at, really, that still has to go, uhh, you should- I have to

1697
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:04,180
cause you- I need a 8-way band to get anything from where you are.

1698
01:36:04,404 --> 01:36:07,166
You go in there, you filter to plan 8.5,

1699
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:10,197
you know, actually there's a 15. Put a piece on here with that word.

1700
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:13,812
Yup. You can go in there, grab the paste and add it to that

1701
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,296
earlier. It's all there. Mmm. It's all in there.

1702
01:36:16,323 --> 01:36:18,386
You keep up and low. You have,

1703
01:36:18,893 --> 01:36:21,958
you know, the world built. It has to add into your city.

1704
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:24,251
Oh, okay. That's what that machine's for.

1705
01:36:24,651 --> 01:36:26,820
One, two. I do not believe in this as well, too.

1706
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:31,670
Yeah. Yeah. That'll be, in instances where the field guys really

1707
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:33,977
need this. That. You that's what you use.

1708
01:36:34,385 --> 01:36:37,972
So that's how you get a flush pack. If you have a stock,

1709
01:36:37,973 --> 01:36:40,723
you're putting it in for months. Okay. Just take a stock push.

1710
01:36:40,724 --> 01:36:43,127
Thank much. So here, that's where, uh,

1711
01:36:43,138 --> 01:36:45,961
I feel like I've been tensed. I need a system around here.

1712
01:36:46,232 --> 01:36:48,030
You know, I've been to my system. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1713
01:36:48,056 --> 01:36:50,831
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's. So, if it's not 6 foot,

1714
01:36:50,832 --> 01:36:54,196
it's very new scrap. Um.

1715
01:36:54,206 --> 01:36:56,941
And, they don't even get a log, they just wanna take it.

1716
01:36:56,942 --> 01:37:01,148
You know, you can look in there, see what jobs associated with CDP number,

1717
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,525
if you don't see that, it's available as a random.

1718
01:37:03,868 --> 01:37:07,658
You can grab that. Go ahead. Remove it from the system and send it

1719
01:37:07,659 --> 01:37:09,705
online on a set. Okay.

1720
01:37:09,706 --> 01:37:12,797
Okay. And have a good time. Keep this quality ready to go.

1721
01:37:12,798 --> 01:37:14,809
You don't. Like, it's been a sheath episode.

1722
01:37:15,457 --> 01:37:18,145
Yeah. So, since I've been received, umm,

1723
01:37:18,156 --> 01:37:20,240
follow up over there now. Scan it.

1724
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:22,416
It's on the PR. are So, like, thank you, you know,

1725
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:25,436
for a new batch, and I've been on my receipt. Okay.

1726
01:37:25,665 --> 01:37:27,963
So, uhm, wait, I've got a nice thing about this,

1727
01:37:28,278 --> 01:37:31,306
and I'm gonna watch you. You have to do with this, you know,

1728
01:37:31,631 --> 01:37:33,836
if you get calls on a little bit more about, hey,

1729
01:37:33,837 --> 01:37:36,949
if we receive this, can we get that? that, come and shut when you're

1730
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,510
looking. in system because you update the right hand.

1731
01:37:39,699 --> 01:37:41,716
Ya know, I mean, I'm honest with that, so the good,

1732
01:37:41,717 --> 01:37:44,596
it shouldn't happen. This should be the communication tool there everybody.

1733
01:37:44,946 --> 01:37:46,965
Thank you. You shouldn't have to come and use the video that app,

1734
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,268
right? You can see the system and work, ya know?

1735
01:37:49,422 --> 01:37:51,585
So by the time they call me, you can get it around your day,

1736
01:37:51,586 --> 01:37:54,799
it's gonna figure it out, right? Ya. Yeah. So that's really what should be

1737
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,620
happening. So, uh,

1738
01:37:57,631 --> 01:38:02,258
it should be R as soon as you can click

1739
01:38:02,259 --> 01:38:06,305
enter on that, is purchase order and they are no longer started when it's

1740
01:38:06,306 --> 01:38:10,469
over. Okay, and you can pull that extra amount of- the overall material or

1741
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:14,529
expected material. Again, we're able to expect a material report for the data,

1742
01:38:14,736 --> 01:38:17,416
and we like it. It's- Have a good week.

1743
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:20,439
Okay, so, but then from here,

1744
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,380
uhm, for you though, for you to go for fun? Okay. We're have to

1745
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:31,644
We'll next one. Oh, yeah, yeah, Let it

1746
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:33,664
go. Yeah,

1747
01:38:34,543 --> 01:38:38,508
so, right there in that the same transparency of the builders,

1748
01:38:38,509 --> 01:38:41,323
even though I flipped my job number, building my work back.

1749
01:38:41,324 --> 01:38:44,240
Okay, bye. Yeah, and then get yourself down to,

1750
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,820
this is what I know, I have to take a look at what I've

1751
01:38:46,821 --> 01:38:49,165
been told should be going to stay. Yeah, and then you can get to

1752
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:52,013
know. I think here we go.

1753
01:38:53,068 --> 01:38:56,043
If you're in the accident and built your portion,

1754
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:58,416
see if you just find a way to- first one,

1755
01:38:58,417 --> 01:39:00,500
2.0, 6.0,

1756
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:02,889
1, so same here all the week. Yeah,

1757
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:05,928
those will do, uh, 3.0. So,

1758
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:08,498
I think that's a new portion there.

1759
01:39:08,828 --> 01:39:10,919
I think that'll be easy to do this one.

1760
01:39:11,163 --> 01:39:13,387
Yeah, and we'll leave it with that one. Yeah, yeah. Go,

1761
01:39:13,388 --> 01:39:17,093
go, Hey, hello. Into the building with the highway in the building.

1762
01:39:17,806 --> 01:39:20,211
This will be the main page of that series.

1763
01:39:20,212 --> 01:39:23,962
in the future. If you must go in and as you scroll down,

1764
01:39:23,965 --> 01:39:27,938
you'll see those options will not take you to address the question.

1765
01:39:27,939 --> 01:39:31,777
I'm going in there and see you'll be in that shape because of the

1766
01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:33,035
emotion of the body. The shape, right? Yeah, so if you look down there,

1767
01:39:33,036 --> 01:39:38,238
they'll not take you into

1768
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,736
the shape, the emotion of anything, and you'll see for that work package,

1769
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:44,783
what's been planned? That's already shipped.

1770
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:48,154
You already know. ... ... ,and if you put that below the clock,

1771
01:39:48,155 --> 01:39:50,196
um, on the plus statement to the same ship,

1772
01:39:51,049 --> 01:39:53,661
that'll give you a great color plus, I don't think so.

1773
01:39:53,662 --> 01:39:56,285
See? Thank you. I they said piece of that on the middle, I already

1774
01:39:56,286 --> 01:39:59,116
shared, I just shared that with you. Okay.

1775
01:39:59,117 --> 01:40:01,936
If you have a balloon, the balloon.

1776
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:04,189
I'm gonna put a number of balloons,

1777
01:40:04,396 --> 01:40:07,459
and then the other one, the HCA. Let's all,

1778
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,510
always think of the balloon, so yeah. Good.

1779
01:40:09,621 --> 01:40:11,970
Do. Thank If you have permissions,

1780
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:14,313
you can un-ship it.

1781
01:40:14,959 --> 01:40:17,360
Un-mother pieces, new pieces,

1782
01:40:17,361 --> 01:40:20,175
all that all. All right. I don't need it,

1783
01:40:20,176 --> 01:40:23,084
but, uhm, that is sure. But, yep. There's more to your face.

1784
01:40:23,952 --> 01:40:25,976
Yeah. So, um.

1785
01:40:25,987 --> 01:40:28,846
you know, alright. So, that has been pre-built a little.

1786
01:40:29,131 --> 01:40:32,162
Then, you can take this tablet out there,

1787
01:40:32,362 --> 01:40:36,671
and neither of your items are looking for. More. As you convert them into

1788
01:40:36,672 --> 01:40:38,821
your station areas, you can build your load.

1789
01:40:39,768 --> 01:40:42,136
Then, as you build your load, you can load it.

1790
01:40:42,137 --> 01:40:45,519
. I mean, I hope you can do that louder than that.

1791
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:49,083
Because, you're in the back of course, I'm doing the camera,

1792
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:53,466
because you're alone. Go. And you'll see what we will look at on our

1793
01:40:53,467 --> 01:40:55,966
screen. We'll make it beforehand.

1794
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:58,211
Alright, ahead and look.

1795
01:40:58,212 --> 01:41:01,250
So, we'll make thousands of items that we've been in.

1796
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:04,811
So, we'll have to have a good day more than next year.

1797
01:41:04,812 --> 01:41:07,905
We'll the next video. Bye. So, well, that is not moment.

1798
01:41:08,349 --> 01:41:13,128
You hit the three dots on the other thing. We can go on

1799
01:41:13,129 --> 01:41:18,038
details. Yeah. Yeah. So now you

1800
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:21,622
got the DSC.

1801
01:41:21,623 --> 01:41:25,044
The- And the reason it says it hasn't been loaded again.

1802
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:28,176
So, if- if you're like, and you don't want to get that,

1803
01:41:28,289 --> 01:41:30,371
then come back and get that loaded button. Bye.

1804
01:41:30,372 --> 01:41:33,764
Hey, checkbox, and you should check in the ones that should load it.

1805
01:41:34,037 --> 01:41:37,531
So, just check what we want to do with the chat so that we

1806
01:41:37,532 --> 01:41:41,221
can see that you won't- So, you just add anything to your load,

1807
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:43,993
and you can just check that off, and then we'll select the analysis,

1808
01:41:43,994 --> 01:41:46,456
and notice you're loading it. It's not- I'm sorry,

1809
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:48,516
you're playing anymore, you're only playing it, right?

1810
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:52,811
So, two minutes in here, it's just something I really like to go with,

1811
01:41:52,812 --> 01:41:55,264
really cool, but it's just a good thing. And then, So, the day I

1812
01:41:55,265 --> 01:41:57,271
go to load it is all from,

1813
01:41:57,681 --> 01:42:00,894
and I know all my parties are there, then I go through and then

1814
01:42:00,895 --> 01:42:03,160
select their thing, objectives. Uhh,

1815
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:06,070
I will submit it. That's a few of you guys can do that.

1816
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,689
I usually suggest that as I see anyone,

1817
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:10,960
like, if you want to file pieces. please subscribe to me more videos. And

1818
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:13,790
then you come back later in the day, you go to another file.

1819
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:17,224
I probably won't see that as it's happening.

1820
01:42:17,225 --> 01:42:21,037
Um, because. because us, I just know that most of the time when it

1821
01:42:21,038 --> 01:42:23,585
is in place and it's like, I have to take lightning,

1822
01:42:23,798 --> 01:42:26,176
what people are not doing, they are the same.

1823
01:42:26,177 --> 01:42:28,874
I'll see Yeah, sure, but eventually when they do that,

1824
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:33,896
they're not gonna piece by piece or whatever you get it and

1825
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:37,005
then just. is. through the depth. So I think we don't know if we

1826
01:42:37,006 --> 01:42:39,265
can put it out. I'm changing everything else. It's coming out of one of

1827
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:42,214
these in my piece. And then as we go with Atlassian,

1828
01:42:42,215 --> 01:42:45,113
we can get a. Or we can build an instrument so we can get

1829
01:42:45,114 --> 01:42:48,235
all the rest of this case. We need to include it in one of

1830
01:42:48,236 --> 01:42:50,623
those things, you know. Yeah. But so this is.

1831
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,826
Thank you. I do want to do it slowly to get shit out like

1832
01:42:54,827 --> 01:42:56,896
that. Yeah. Alright.

1833
01:42:58,467 --> 01:43:00,655
Bye You can be building the work on the brand,

1834
01:43:00,656 --> 01:43:02,991
then then just going along the truck. Yeah.

1835
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:06,851
So, some people, you guys have to sign this.

1836
01:43:06,589 --> 01:43:09,118
This lesson, when we do the shop housing,

1837
01:43:09,296 --> 01:43:12,929
that right there would be shown as the logo bit.

1838
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:17,260
Umm. you As it was built on the ground,

1839
01:43:17,298 --> 01:43:20,569
it was a truck gave you two pics, we're on the truck and it's

1840
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,931
gone, and we get shit. Alright.

1841
01:43:22,932 --> 01:43:25,755
You guys can't even decide how you want to do the helicopter.

1842
01:43:26,003 --> 01:43:28,747
So everybody knows what does the motive mean.

1843
01:43:28,748 --> 01:43:32,815
Does it mean it's basically on the truck or- It's built on ground,

1844
01:43:32,816 --> 01:43:36,510
yeah. Uhm, so, ehm, for us,

1845
01:43:36,511 --> 01:43:39,011
our definition shot those in. Thank you.

1846
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:41,481
Loom was, that load was built on the ground.

1847
01:43:41,509 --> 01:43:44,094
I had a load of them home again, but it's ready to get bumpy.

1848
01:43:44,292 --> 01:43:46,939
So yeah, that's it. Yeah. Yeah.

1849
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,018
Yeah. And that's probably the best way to do it,

1850
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:52,020
because then, as you get it, you're all down to down on it,

1851
01:43:52,021 --> 01:43:54,152
and you're putting rows and the rows.

1852
01:43:54,153 --> 01:43:56,589
You can go through that. And that, ah, you have two of them,

1853
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:59,479
this one, two of them, this row. There are some more elements down,

1854
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,686
and start on the next row. I, those two,

1855
01:44:01,687 --> 01:44:05,173
you're there, those two are there. You're working down in the list as you

1856
01:44:05,174 --> 01:44:08,542
build your load, and then you have that marked off.

1857
01:44:08,543 --> 01:44:11,582
You know, your quantities are good, and then when you ship it,

1858
01:44:12,028 --> 01:44:14,668
it's all right. Yeah,

1859
01:44:14,669 --> 01:44:19,211
so it is. Thank you.

1860
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:23,695
But first time you do it, I would recommend you walk.

1861
01:44:23,696 --> 01:44:26,318
Love you. Love Love you. Love Love too.

1862
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,772
Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah,

1863
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:33,398
yeah, I would recommend you do

1864
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:35,770
it. No, yeah.

1865
01:44:37,178 --> 01:44:39,439
No, I'm going to share, uhm, I'm going to share,

1866
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,179
uhm, the rating. That's, uh,

1867
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,834
what can you not- I'm going to uhm,

1868
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:47,169
I'm uhm,

1869
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:51,371
I'm going to share, uhm, and in a minute.

1870
01:44:51,372 --> 01:44:54,292
Here is how I'll be able to join him for receiving.

1871
01:44:54,868 --> 01:44:57,043
And if you call down, he'll say, uhm,

1872
01:44:57,054 --> 01:44:59,280
open him uhm. Cool.

1873
01:44:59,281 --> 01:45:01,838
But got another You in the middle of the city.

1874
01:45:02,581 --> 01:45:09,940
Yeah, I'll have room. Thank you. This

1875
01:45:09,941 --> 01:45:12,489
is a final animation, man.

1876
01:45:12,627 --> 01:45:15,219
It's just really, you know, it's amazing.

1877
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,814
And so,

1878
01:45:17,815 --> 01:45:20,678
you can do it this way or flip them back before you have a

1879
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:23,531
speech period. Yeah, eat this. I'm I will.

1880
01:45:23,532 --> 01:45:25,599
I'm sorry that that's enough. And that's really,

1881
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,756
you know, I'm just,

1882
01:45:31,751 --> 01:45:35,594
That's what's been on the line. That's why I'm on the line.

1883
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:39,299
It's not going to play out again.

1884
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,727
Thank you. Yeah, yeah. It's exactly.

1885
01:45:41,978 --> 01:45:45,153
Well, not so many things in here, in the suggestion of how to contain

1886
01:45:45,154 --> 01:45:47,771
it. I couldn't, I couldn't put an estimation point.

1887
01:45:47,772 --> 01:45:50,762
. . I couldn't comment down on the frickin' password. You could click the

1888
01:45:50,763 --> 01:45:55,472
button and spin it down and it talks about the amount of screens here.

1889
01:45:55,616 --> 01:45:58,842
Okay. You could join the Aix. Oh, I think it's just a little powerful.

1890
01:45:58,843 --> 01:46:01,724
Okay. That really won't happen. Yeah, I'm gonna shift and get a bit of

1891
01:46:01,725 --> 01:46:05,795
into receiving the analysis. I'll see you in the video about him shifting and

1892
01:46:05,796 --> 01:46:07,955
1,000, 1,000, 1,000,

1893
01:46:07,956 --> 01:46:11,164
1,000, and you just look back and forth with the two pads.

1894
01:46:11,165 --> 01:46:14,302
That's it, I'll be back in June. So if I had hit,

1895
01:46:14,303 --> 01:46:18,756

1902
01:46:37,246 --> 01:46:39,728

1916
01:47:23,942 --> 01:47:29,249
He paid the initiative. I used to make very

1917
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,423
much use on the tool, and we gave it to,

1918

uh, yeah. I don't do it all the time.

1921

1925
01:47:56,457 --> 01:48:00,027
the phone, jeez. . Now, how are you going to do it when you

1926
01:48:00,028 --> 01:48:03,523

01:48:17,134 --> 01:48:19,604
So, you know what I mean?

1930
01:48:19,605 --> 01:48:22,019
Umm, it goes, they've had to- . Umm, it's profile,

1931
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,839
it's written PMDOL, it's user by user basis,

1932
01:48:25,058 --> 01:48:28,076
but I can copy PMDOL solutions to cost users.

1933
01:48:28,077 --> 01:48:32,529

of tabs in this little strip of stuff.

1937
01:48:40,904 --> 01:48:44,151
I just went there and thought, you know, I passed you through yourself.

1938
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:46,531
But it'd be much. You haven't added any of your bookmarks to stuff.

And, uh,

1963
01:50:21,299 --> 01:50:23,959
this of all, we can't secure that. We have everything like ours.

1964
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,476
All right, so. We can't secure that, but all of us,

1965
01:50:26,477 --> 01:50:28,762

1966

1971
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:48,671
for the need. This is like an old viewer being closed free with a

1972
01:50:48,672 --> 01:50:53,464
sub. love. So, just get there to get through that yellow

Thank you. So. But yeah,

1975
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,469

1976
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:05,236
but all of you are all the way in the middle of thing.

1977
01:51:05,237 --> 01:51:08,984
I believe you have this, uh,

1978

1983
01:51:30,202 --> 01:51:33,245
one damage is a lot easier to get. It's fun enough to manage it.

1984
01:51:33,582 --> 01:51:37,396
I actually need to, uh, speed up the subject.

1985
01:51:37,397 --> 01:51:39,545
Okay, uhm, there's something in the,

1986
01:51:39,546 --> 01:51:42,477
like, feedback and sort of communication, but you can't tell it.

1987
01:51:42,478 --> 01:51:45,804
Uh, uhm, uhm, you can go home and read them some- We're going to

1988
01:51:45,805 --> 01:51:48,603

Shouldn't get out of here.

1993
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:04,971
I never wanted to leave this again, even if it's even up to the

1994
01:52:04,972 --> 01:52:07,295
store, so it can fit in there. Oh, I don't know what's going on

1995
01:52:07,296 --> 01:52:10,249
with me. Alright, I'm going to turn it over. Thank And then I think

1996
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,414
it's going to affect me. Yeah, well, I saw it,

1997
01:52:12,415 --> 01:52:15,527
but, umm, I thinking, I'm not thinking, I'm not thinking,

2001
01:52:21,873 --> 01:52:24,319
but, umm, I can't even go around saying that,

2002
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,399
but essentially, I can't even. Thank you. If you have some material,

2003
01:52:26,547 --> 01:52:28,916
you can ask why I can't even protect some of that meaty.

2004
01:52:30,002 --> 01:52:32,546
And if you have an explanation about it, you can basically leave it in

2005
01:52:32,547 --> 01:52:36,855
the zest of all. Nothing else. . I can go over the process.

2006
01:52:36,856 --> 01:52:39,109

01:55:44,614 --> 01:55:46,936
Okay. Mm. Mm.

2066
01:55:46,937 --> 01:55:51,101
Why is it going to be so awkward? It ticked in the mirror.

01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:01,719
I don't know about it. We don't know about it.

2071

2073
01:56:09,515 --> 01:56:14,839
tell you that I'm not too honest. Thanks. You know, and a lot of

2074
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,931
times, like, as a person.

2075
01:56:17,932 --> 01:56:20,219
for a second. You know, shop releases,

2076
01:56:20,524 --> 01:56:22,796
there's usually one word that means,

2077
01:56:22,797 --> 01:56:25,182
or maybe two word that means it's okay, or something,

2078
01:56:25,183 --> 01:56:27,726
like that. And that'll be. You know,

2079
01:56:27,727 --> 01:56:30,464
so, in a lot of times,

2080
01:56:30,465 --> 01:56:32,828
the ehm, ehm, like that.

2081
01:56:33,699 --> 01:56:36,409
Good. That's what we use for the ehm,

2082
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:39,251
and they're going to have time and they're going to be very supportive.

2083
01:56:39,389 --> 01:56:41,437
So, over that, it's just a five-year budget,

2084
01:56:41,438 --> 01:56:43,606
but it's still here. It's amazing. Thank you. It's really,

2085
01:56:44,032 --> 01:56:46,195
really good at the bottom. It's amazing.

2086
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:48,677
Doesn't matter if you can keep on coming.

2087
01:56:48,678 --> 01:56:51,011
It's, you're sorry, the shut down will be getting hot. And we'll one.

2091
01:56:59,979 --> 01:57:03,707

2092
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:06,274
Um, but for the stuff that's coming up to action.

2093
01:57:06,275 --> 01:57:09,286
Um. Bye I'm going to have to work back some sh- We are in

2094
01:57:09,287 --> 01:57:11,709
London. Do you have a package of letters?

2095
01:57:11,874 --> 01:57:15,040
A minor? Is that an answer in the- .

2096
01:57:15,076 --> 01:57:18,627
Back when you tell me it was. In the store,

2097
01:57:18,851 --> 01:57:21,085
you can pass it on. There's only five,

2098
01:57:21,086 --> 01:57:23,990
but so far out. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to take a look at that

2099
01:57:23,991 --> 01:57:25,992
because I see that you know you're looking down.

2100
01:57:27,363 --> 01:57:29,924
I'm going to mess with Bill Broughs and make sure you know how he's

2101
01:57:29,925 --> 01:57:32,302
moving. I'm going to make sure you know how. You know, being mites is

2102
01:57:32,419 --> 01:57:34,851
either a good one to mention, plenty of ground,

2103
01:57:34,989 --> 01:57:37,847
one of the previous ones that I just didn't know were,

2104
01:57:37,848 --> 01:57:41,039
uh, maybe not. Bye! I was here to start working on it anyway,

2105
01:57:41,917 --> 01:57:46,623
so. But, I think that that would have been here since those are tied

2106
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,727
to, So, you know, the station,

2107
01:57:49,019 --> 01:57:52,342
or the leading thing that's just on the B-strap inside,

2108
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:55,472
gonna add and kick it away at any And,

2109
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:58,223
maybe it's not gonna affect me, at least. Okay.

2110
01:57:58,609 --> 01:58:01,653
Don't have a cut saw on there, and the cutless is cut,

2111
01:58:01,654 --> 01:58:05,870
and then a cut saw. That's gonna make me lighter than I have from

2112
01:58:05,871 --> 01:58:10,386
working on it, at least trying to meet some of the stations in Bitbucket.

2113
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:12,995
Yeah. Yeah. That's the only way I can do. You know,

2114
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:16,576
I can be lighter than I have from the left, and then I can

2115
01:58:16,577 --> 01:58:19,977
see just how there You know,

2116
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:23,171
just not enough things out there for every issue,

2117
01:58:23,172 --> 01:58:25,906
or by the way the science language has to be done.

2118
01:58:26,289 --> 01:58:30,099
Everything we do. So I'm not thinking we'll be there,

2119
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:33,407
not thinking we'll be able to expose.

2120
01:58:33,408 --> 01:58:35,476
It's time.

2121
01:58:35,477 --> 01:58:39,865
He's right now. I'm pretty sure I've been following P and the user's stuff.

2122
01:58:40,002 --> 01:58:42,093
Well, not since I'm following. Okay. Okay. I heard it's behind me.

2123
01:58:42,188 --> 01:58:44,879
I hear it's behind Proclass for PowerFam.

2124
01:58:44,947 --> 01:58:47,083
Yeah. He's behind me. He's me.

2125
01:58:47,084 --> 01:58:50,362
He's behind me. I'm for Charles. Yes. And he fits in with all the

2126
01:58:50,363 --> 01:58:53,040
literature on YouTube. Thank you. I love it. I love the video.

2127
01:58:53,079 --> 01:58:56,077
And I'm gonna the tech board of partners and,

2128
01:58:56,078 --> 01:58:58,284

2129
01:58:58,285 --> 01:58:59,236

2130
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:08,109
you Thank you. Alright,

2131
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:11,020
listen, you guys, you know, there's been a very dangerous hit.

2132
01:59:12,174 --> 01:59:14,354
Very good magic. I don't know, I don't know,

2133
01:59:14,450 --> 01:59:17,387
don't even know what to do, it's really- Alright. It's pretty cut and dry,

2134
01:59:17,388 --> 01:59:20,560
uhm, as we started getting from this low down,

2135
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:22,599
and you're going on the middle side, I know,

2136
01:59:22,796 --> 01:59:25,049
and my home is going to be- It's a really, really nice job,

2137
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:27,378
and it's so important. Alright, we're doing a little bit of fun,

2138
01:59:27,454 --> 01:59:30,620
and then we're going to go through this one. And then we're going out

2139
01:59:30,621 --> 01:59:32,870
with the guy, and he's going to get that. you I'm going to be

2140
01:59:32,871 --> 01:59:35,584
able to see anything go through this process. We have really,

2141
01:59:35,712 --> 01:59:37,834
stupidly, and with the right hair hoe, I don't know,

2142
01:59:37,845 --> 01:59:40,440
any of the production and style issues. questions. State . Start,

2143
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,959
stop, you know, through the process of listening.

2144
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:47,179
Once you get it done, give me a call over and I'm up there.

2145
01:59:47,491 --> 01:59:49,877
Okay. and we weren't the absolute needed.

2146
01:59:50,146 --> 01:59:54,398
We needed that two to three, five times depending on the god.

2147
01:59:55,115 --> 01:59:57,406
One of these seconds. Foundation. So,

2148
01:59:57,907 --> 02:00:00,765
and then the while, the, while, there, but there's a video.

2149
02:00:01,383 --> 02:00:03,527
So, uhm, right now,

2150
02:00:03,537 --> 02:00:06,119
there you go. Appreciate it. Take the time. Yeah. Yep.

2151
02:00:06,426 --> 02:00:08,998
So, we have a question that you can install,

2152
02:00:09,219 --> 02:00:11,956
and then, uh, let's begin with a little situation. situation.

2153
02:00:11,957 --> 02:00:14,782
You can follow us on Twitter. We'll make it happen.

2154
02:00:15,422 --> 02:00:18,034
Something good? Right here. Yep.

2155
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:23,190
Thanks again, man. Bye. Yeah,

2156
02:00:23,191 --> 02:00:25,285
you know what to do. Yes,

2157
02:00:25,834 --> 02:00:26,385
you can hear what to do.

2158
02:00:36,071 --> 02:00:40,526
Who's going to have to look on any given panel?

2159
02:00:40,864 --> 02:00:44,297
You can tell, listen, you're going to be moving on a bad day,

2160
02:00:44,298 --> 02:00:47,191
don't you? Yeah,

2161
02:00:47,192 --> 02:00:49,569
an issue, yeah. I'm surprised. Don't call me for sounding the idea unless you

2162
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:52,000
vote. out.

2163
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:54,473
If you have It'll be second nature to that.

2164
02:00:54,474 --> 02:00:57,643
We put a cheesy cross and we're going to leave that copy.

2165
02:00:57,644 --> 02:01:00,278
That's the same kind of eager to want.

2166
02:01:00,569 --> 02:01:04,187
I didn't do that. Well, and I've shown it to him a few times

2167
02:01:04,188 --> 02:01:06,406
in capabilities, you know, on a teenager,

2168
02:01:06,585 --> 02:01:09,071
you know, B. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2169
02:01:09,072 --> 02:01:12,334
Yeah. Yeah. It's about 7.5 million in the day.

2170
02:01:12,711 --> 02:01:17,557
Tools may open. Yeah. I'll call on the other I know

2171
02:01:17,558 --> 02:01:21,344
that would be a challenge for them to sit on the side and put

2172
02:01:21,345 --> 02:01:24,253
the meat out bigger, but. Three and a few more.

2173
02:01:24,254 --> 02:01:27,089
Um. Don't worry. I'm sorry. For the list, we're gonna do with soft food,

2174
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:29,991
with ice packs. We gotta fill out what is going on here.

2175
02:01:30,147 --> 02:01:32,889
Yeah. And then like I was saying, the shot would be.

2176
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:37,146
I and I don't know yet,

2177
02:01:37,147 --> 02:01:39,463
but, Everspend, no legal preach.

2178
02:01:39,581 --> 02:01:42,432
This is my time to hate. . Alright, a bit of a rant.

2179
02:01:42,433 --> 02:01:44,561
Or, yeah, just a smother, so. Ehh,

2180
02:01:44,562 --> 02:01:46,732
ugh, yeah, so if you think we want to be some,

2181
02:01:46,843 --> 02:01:48,552
we might have to give it a really nice and a good part of

2182
02:01:48,553 --> 02:01:53,454
our action. Goodness. I don't know if should look for a stand-up

2183
02:01:53,455 --> 02:01:57,071
or a stand-up or a a stand-up.

2184
02:01:57,072 --> 02:01:59,758
I wish you'd soon have a please day sponsor. I mean,

2185
02:01:59,759 --> 02:02:01,956
uh, so much truth about this time a lot.

2186
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:08,190
So, I'm meeting for a- and this time to add the additional

2187
02:02:08,191 --> 02:02:13,091
modules that you don't have. Actually, if you did not have the common

2188
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:15,354
CLC, Yurra,

2189
02:02:15,355 --> 02:02:18,135
and a few different things in there.

2190
02:02:18,136 --> 02:02:23,454
So. Once

2191
02:02:23,455 --> 02:02:26,578
he adds those models to my 12th end of the year,

2192
02:02:26,579 --> 02:02:29,116
that was true. Umm, it's better card on the wristband.

2193
02:02:29,117 --> 02:02:31,598
. Sats, uhh, coming to the top.

2194
02:02:32,355 --> 02:02:36,819
The original port without the additional models is about the key brand.

2195
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:39,418
Amen. So,

2196
02:02:39,419 --> 02:02:42,721
we're going to have that, which, um,

2197
02:02:42,731 --> 02:02:44,779
how did you, what was yours? Well,

2198
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:48,475
uh huh. I'm going to hit the list of 33K following the lead.

2199
02:02:49,106 --> 02:02:51,479
You can call it and run it back, and use the,

2200
02:02:52,132 --> 02:02:54,665
great ball networks. There's Sshit, okay.

2201
02:02:55,136 --> 02:02:58,245
I'm not even teaching here, I'm using the balance of your team.

2202
02:02:59,366 --> 02:03:03,794
Okay. So, anyway. It's like 35,000 and so you can purchase them.

2203
02:03:03,795 --> 02:03:07,451
So you think we can figure that out,

2204
02:03:07,452 --> 02:03:09,561
can we? This can't be absolute. Thank you for your patience. Oh,

2205
02:03:09,734 --> 02:03:11,851
I don't want to call on the reading. I know.

2206
02:03:12,579 --> 02:03:14,888
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

2207
02:03:15,168 --> 02:03:17,337
We're just going to be like, ignoring from time. Welcome. No,

2208
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:22,909
my guess is probably 17 with 18.

2209
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:25,550
It's about 14, but that's also- The Jira,

2210
02:03:25,551 --> 02:03:27,671
and which is stating our main explaining of them.

2211
02:03:28,096 --> 02:03:31,218
Cause I've made it, I've been down since first of the year,

2212
02:03:31,219 --> 02:03:33,696
so you've got to find some of them. So,

2213
02:03:33,697 --> 02:03:36,895
uhm, so we're gonna leave at the maintenance plan on the nurse and that

2214
02:03:36,896 --> 02:03:39,667
we have any support. We don't,

2215
02:03:39,668 --> 02:03:44,588
uh. What's he doing?

2216
02:03:44,589 --> 02:03:47,249
So, we're not loading up.

2217
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:49,557
Let's go for it. Bye. Bye. and Chola,

2218
02:03:49,619 --> 02:03:51,711
Phunk, as well. So,

2219
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:53,752
we're planning and helping some great projects.

2220
02:03:53,753 --> 02:03:54,861
So, she says it out. She says it out. She says it out. She

2221
02:03:54,862 --> 02:03:57,191
says it out. out. She out.

2222
02:03:58,097 --> 02:04:01,259
So, okay, you know, a little over a second.

2223
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,418
It just covers there. Yeah.

2224
02:04:04,602 --> 02:04:07,532
you Umm.

2225
02:04:07,543 --> 02:04:11,256
Are we on that little stairs? Can that person report me that I need

2226
02:04:11,257 --> 02:04:13,403
to check the numbers? Thank much. Yeah,

2227
02:04:13,404 --> 02:04:16,517
uh, you, uh, maybe between the two,

2228
02:04:16,537 --> 02:04:21,501
one, maybe, computer and, uh, two. Um. Uh, Middle

2229
02:04:21,502 --> 02:04:23,706
school? Uh, uh, So. And there we go.

2230
02:04:23,707 --> 02:04:24,388
Oh my gosh. You

2231
02:04:29,231 --> 02:04:32,766
Uhm, I would be able to hear this.

2232
02:04:33,362 --> 02:04:36,935
I'd say it was funny, it was obvious to me that she had to

2233
02:04:36,936 --> 02:04:40,400
read. You get it, baby. And then it says,

2234
02:04:40,401 --> 02:04:43,338
oh no, it's his, oh, he's stolen e-mails,

2235
02:04:43,339 --> 02:04:45,902
and we need to find Jira, so he can buy. You know what the

2236
02:04:45,903 --> 02:04:49,480
chat is? And then it goes to Umm,

2237
02:04:49,491 --> 02:04:51,538
it just gets lost. Umm, Umm,

2238
02:04:51,549 --> 02:04:56,000
Medi, Loom. I'm not. I'm actually about this one and my things are certainly,

2239
02:04:56,001 --> 02:04:58,937
you know, I'm gonna, uh, come to politics, they are going to be,

2240
02:04:59,803 --> 02:05:03,943
this. Thanks. But that burns really fast.

2241
02:05:04,116 --> 02:05:07,698
I'm going to start there and begin to update his things so it'll be

2242
02:05:07,699 --> 02:05:11,942
no useable. Good morning. Good morning to University.

2243
02:05:11,943 --> 02:05:14,437
Good morning,

2244
02:05:14,438 --> 02:05:17,471
everybody, hub. How's it going?

2245
02:05:17,472 --> 02:05:19,870
Good, I'm John D'Yuma, I didn't make a clear,

2246
02:05:19,871 --> 02:05:22,536
uhm, sorry, but it was, it was processing,

2247
02:05:22,537 --> 02:05:25,511
it was, uhm, pre-built load of score.

2248
02:05:29,067 --> 02:05:30,842
The most of them is, you know, it's a lot of the projects that

2249
02:05:30,843 --> 02:05:33,556
kind of things smaller. All right.

2250
02:05:33,557 --> 02:05:36,009
Yeah, we should put a game. On,

2251
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:38,424
we can assemble it. Let's, yeah. Um,

2252
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:40,903
you know, I'm really meant to go back in some ways over there.

2253
02:05:40,904 --> 02:05:45,461
Thank you. Thank . I had to

2254
02:05:45,462 --> 02:05:49,636
drop angles, and I was going to go and have a chest in it.

2255
02:05:49,637 --> 02:05:51,649
. . . You're gonna be better independent,

2256
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:54,528
with some more support here. Say, you know,

2257
02:05:54,543 --> 02:05:57,676
I'm going to ask you if I don't have any final points.

2258
02:05:57,677 --> 02:05:59,921
And then, obviously,

2259
02:05:59,922 --> 02:06:02,879
I'm gonna make a shadow. Yeah. There'll be like,

2260
02:06:02,923 --> 02:06:05,711
smart sheets, and we're all, there's no- they have money to get.

2261
02:06:05,712 --> 02:06:10,267
I don't know who's still getting used

2262
02:06:10,268 --> 02:06:14,571
to that. Uh, so it's kind of,

2263
02:06:14,572 --> 02:06:17,399
it's kind of like,

2264
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:21,796
this is rather than another video game.

2265
02:06:21,797 --> 02:06:25,608
. Yeah, so let's,

2266
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:30,608
I

2267
02:06:30,756 --> 02:06:33,064
was gonna say, well, you want us to, like, prevent,

2268
02:06:33,123 --> 02:06:35,104
see, there's a lot of cost in Canada, there's a lot of time to

2269
02:06:35,105 --> 02:06:37,236
do, but I guess I'll go up there in the next week so I

2270
02:06:37,237 --> 02:06:40,573
don't week a minute. I don't really just want to reschedule those events and

2271
02:06:40,574 --> 02:06:46,091
all that. No rest. Thank listening.

2272
02:06:46,092 --> 02:06:48,541
Yeah so, so with the bonus integration,

2273
02:06:48,542 --> 02:06:50,555
I'm hoping to get that, that,

2274
02:06:51,364 --> 02:06:53,660
again, on the announce edition as well.

2275
02:06:53,661 --> 02:06:56,331
Yes. So I did for training today, uhm,

2276
02:06:56,342 --> 02:06:59,994
soon again I was thinking, what are you guys about? What the process can

2277
02:06:59,995 --> 02:07:03,694
contain all the evidence? Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, I'm guessing a brand

2278
02:07:03,695 --> 02:07:06,786
new number of I.T.E. because it's going to be something that's attached to the

2279
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:09,825
server, but they're not a promise it's going to be easy.

2280
02:07:09,826 --> 02:07:13,301
You uhm, post it on a nasty computer,

2281
02:07:13,526 --> 02:07:15,664
yeah, and then it's, uhm,

2282
02:07:15,674 --> 02:07:18,191
right. So that I'm going to be doing a little colleague minute.

2283
02:07:18,192 --> 02:07:20,236
with you in the process, uhm,

2284
02:07:20,247 --> 02:07:22,488
some nice parts that come into the system for you, you know,

2285
02:07:22,545 --> 02:07:25,127
so, you know, with you at all the events. Um.

2286
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:27,791
Bye. Now, I'm pretty sure even the plugin,

2287
02:07:27,792 --> 02:07:29,972
you know, you know, the integration is the applicant,

2288
02:07:29,973 --> 02:07:32,681
the promise, and the innovation, and then you just point it to,

2289
02:07:32,682 --> 02:07:35,691
well, they should set that up. Uh, for you to hopefully cause the,

2290
02:07:36,076 --> 02:07:38,643
the promise that the integration is a little bit complex,

2291
02:07:38,644 --> 02:07:40,928
it's gotta, for lot of seconds,

2292
02:07:40,929 --> 02:07:43,389
you gotta set up in there. You're here. and so many variations of their

2293
02:07:43,434 --> 02:07:45,949
new site aren't all in the biggest games.

2294
02:07:46,132 --> 02:07:48,919
There's a little bit of conflicts, but like, get me to uhh,

2295
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:53,270
uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, Get back into the desktop version and go into a

2296
02:07:53,271 --> 02:07:55,974
production control job and life.

2297
02:07:56,099 --> 02:07:58,271
Get it like you're going to get into this in place.

2298
02:07:58,272 --> 02:08:00,514
Here, oh, and then you'll click.

2299
02:08:01,082 --> 02:08:05,271
Nest with grown-ups and then you'll generate a file and you'll shoot that into

2300
02:08:05,272 --> 02:08:07,387
my phone right now. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So,

2301
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:11,780
when you do that, you choose progress integration on that optimization,

2302
02:08:12,283 --> 02:08:15,807
and it spits out that file, it gets in the- It does everything there

2303
02:08:16,348 --> 02:08:18,120
pretty much. Thank you

2304
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:27,539
You're playing him into where he will then be controlled by produce,

2305
02:08:27,629 --> 02:08:34,209
which is nice food. You'd

2306
02:08:34,256 --> 02:08:37,031
have to do it before there's something nasty in the stage,

2307
02:08:37,032 --> 02:08:39,196
so you want to go combine it.

2308
02:08:39,197 --> 02:08:40,380
It's where you want to Okay.

2309
02:08:49,151 --> 02:08:53,892
and optimizations down out there in

2310
02:08:53,893 --> 02:08:57,019
plate nesting settings. So there we're supposed to take the power.

2311
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:59,636
you know what I actually would have, uh,

2312
02:08:59,647 --> 02:09:01,924
when you run such a little bit. Yeah,

2313
02:09:01,925 --> 02:09:05,171
yeah. We used to use field projects and now it's just the same way.

2314
02:09:05,172 --> 02:09:08,484
Yeah. Okay. Now it's gonna be hard for us to achieve and play that

2315
02:09:08,485 --> 02:09:11,217
game and, uh, it'll be like, more.

2316
02:09:11,218 --> 02:09:13,268
Keep an eye on this. Give me the magic spot, right? Bye bye. Uh,

2317
02:09:13,289 --> 02:09:16,190
it gives, uh, uh,

2318
02:09:16,211 --> 02:09:18,242
the impact. Bye bye. Yes.

2319
02:09:18,243 --> 02:09:20,871
Oh, I made it.

2320
02:09:20,872 --> 02:09:23,423
Ah. I love the mission of the company. I love the name of the

2321
02:09:23,424 --> 02:09:26,321
software. I love the area.

2322
02:09:26,322 --> 02:09:29,171
And still projects have people in the same area.

2323
02:09:29,172 --> 02:09:31,229
And it's loveless ride with us.

2324
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:33,286
It's, it's a huge road.

2325
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:37,088
And I would always set the trouble with, by setting up all the steps.

2326
02:09:37,089 --> 02:09:39,858
Thank you. And it's no problem. It's like, I don't care.

2327
02:09:39,859 --> 02:09:43,083
You guys figured that out. If you're somebody who thinks about it,

2328
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:45,720
you can make this thing alright. I'm ready for Again,

2329
02:09:46,228 --> 02:09:48,501
I'm gonna concentrate on it. Well, yeah.

2330
02:09:49,552 --> 02:09:51,626
That'll be nicely done. Yeah, yeah,

2331
02:09:51,627 --> 02:09:55,303
yeah, yeah, and then we'll see them at a scale of their efforts.

2332
02:09:55,304 --> 02:09:58,007
Umm, I know, we don't know each other,

2333
02:09:58,432 --> 02:10:00,885
we live in Bitport, we have here, various adjustments.

2334
02:10:00,886 --> 02:10:03,714
That was good. Umm, yeah, yeah,

2335
02:10:03,715 --> 02:10:08,714
yeah.

2336
02:10:09,196 --> 02:10:12,022
. Yeah. And have that, excuse me,

2337
02:10:12,023 --> 02:10:14,506
I promise, play a lot of results. Yeah. And then with these,

2338
02:10:14,507 --> 02:10:16,777
they're a full label. And that would be fantastic.

2339
02:10:16,778 --> 02:10:17,231
Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Oh.

2340
02:10:23,842 --> 02:10:26,367
No, I'm not a logical sucker though,

2341
02:10:26,368 --> 02:10:30,500
I'm gonna be able to guess a little bit more efficiently because yeah,

2342
02:10:30,533 --> 02:10:33,191
I sense all of our units, so I'm gonna toss them to the,

2343
02:10:33,192 --> 02:10:36,837
I feel like I found one chat, and without any more space,

2344
02:10:36,838 --> 02:10:39,740
I mean, there's so many things that we can guess. Yeah,

2345
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:42,962
this is a space, I'm 16 years old and the part of it is

2346
02:10:42,963 --> 02:10:46,308
so, that's where we're going. Yeah, yeah,

2347
02:10:46,392 --> 02:10:48,523
yeah, yeah. I can't even go out on a trombone line. Well,

2348
02:10:48,524 --> 02:10:50,682
let me know when- I mean, it's not the first one,

2349
02:10:50,683 --> 02:10:54,930
well then, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, it's not, it's not the first one.

2350
02:10:55,029 --> 02:10:57,256
Yeah, yeah, it's the first one.

2351
02:10:57,257 --> 02:10:59,819
Get that, I'm sorry, that's what's going on today.

2352
02:11:00,084 --> 02:11:02,285
So, uh, swing a little bit, I'll get it cold,

2353
02:11:02,286 --> 02:11:04,511
we'll get that order, hopefully, get that, that,

2354
02:11:04,512 --> 02:11:06,628
in your face. So, yeah,

2355
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:08,867
and then you can do it somewhere else, but maybe it's not.

2356
02:11:09,794 --> 02:11:12,988
So, let me see if I can get it turned out.

2357
02:11:12,989 --> 02:11:16,600
Please. . I mean, he doesn't even have a gun in his head.

2358
02:11:16,653 --> 02:11:20,137
Mine was like a human. We need to have it. And I'll see the

2359
02:11:20,138 --> 02:11:23,254
next Staying down is superior for two reasons.

2360
02:11:23,255 --> 02:11:25,342
I know it take more. It's 35k women.

2361
02:11:27,068 --> 02:11:29,231
I've got no sawing. Okay. Sir.

2362
02:11:29,232 --> 02:11:31,854
What do you mean? Do you know what I mean?

2363
02:11:33,581 --> 02:11:35,986
I told the movement. Yeah. John had, like, 100k and now he's done it

2364
02:11:35,987 --> 02:11:38,501
by 75k. Oh. you Out, something like that.

2365
02:11:38,502 --> 02:11:40,733
I don't even need it. But we have massive shit out of it,

2366
02:11:40,734 --> 02:11:42,790
you know what? Basically, we're just staying in. We're going to volume,

2367
02:11:42,791 --> 02:11:45,251
take our trucks, and then credit companies. I'm gonna go watch.

2368
02:11:45,252 --> 02:11:47,646
We're going into a four-wheel shit. We're not last night.

2369
02:11:48,112 --> 02:11:51,964
We're not that. Did he get to update the price of the violence?

2370
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:54,782
Bye, Eric. Good. Good. I don't use a two-wheel shit.

2371
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:58,645
I don't use-wheel shit. I don't use Hmm.

2372
02:12:02,116 --> 02:12:05,026
I think that was a good bridge. Yeah,

2373
02:12:05,027 --> 02:12:08,185
I didn't say it already, but I'm putting the lock on.

2374
02:12:09,539 --> 02:12:19,211
Very good. . .

2375
02:12:19,212 --> 02:12:24,211
Umm.

2376
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:28,789
But let's see if I can force the master. I'm not She's gonna finish

2377
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:32,702
off that, it's like. Then there's Mima,

2378
02:12:32,703 --> 02:12:35,280
Teario, Rovo, and you will be able to go to the 3-8-9.

2379
02:12:35,102 --> 02:12:39,047
Bye. But with the 9-9-8-8,

2380
02:12:39,048 --> 02:12:41,808
this is gonna be the part of what I'm having with videos,

2381
02:12:42,534 --> 02:12:44,760
staring with you. Good. Good. Umm,

2382
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:45,173
Sucks

2383
02:12:53,176 --> 02:12:55,969
I'm learning a lot, I'm actually learning a lot more in here because we

2384
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:58,157
can't escape through anything similar here.

2385
02:12:58,302 --> 02:13:00,624
That means you've understood. forward. I said, well,

2386
02:13:00,625 --> 02:13:02,698
you know, material on the line, you know,

2387
02:13:02,699 --> 02:13:06,376
it really won't come true as well. You're so fun with you.

2388
02:13:06,377 --> 02:13:10,051
Yeah, yeah, it was fun with you. and I'm a Once the video falls,

2389
02:13:10,134 --> 02:13:12,945
that's how I smell it. It takes you out of that, I wish you.

2390
02:13:12,946 --> 02:13:15,078
Yeah, it will be, spray-draming,

2391
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:17,061
just to get some of the really good times, I feel it's been in

2392
02:13:17,062 --> 02:13:19,034
the studio. I'm here to send it to me here. Alright. So I'm gonna

2393
02:13:19,035 --> 02:13:21,785
play, I hit it sitting alright,

2394
02:13:21,786 --> 02:13:25,286
still. Don't forget to for more the room has,

2395
02:13:25,290 --> 02:13:28,868
I'm gonna play into yours because it's not related to how much tech you

2396
02:13:28,936 --> 02:13:31,605
got here. Well, I hope you're working on this question.

2397
02:13:31,606 --> 02:13:37,000
question. Thank you very much.

2398
02:13:37,001 --> 02:13:39,981
Well, I wish you most about it, but it can be,

2399
02:13:39,982 --> 02:13:44,279
Uuh,

2400
02:13:44,289 --> 02:13:46,427
ehm, Jex Pocha, Ehm, Jase, C, C, C,

2401
02:13:46,428 --> 02:13:48,634
C, C, C, C, C, C. Thank Thank you,

2402
02:13:48,635 --> 02:13:50,746
this is Simon. David, you're welcome. Welcome.

2403
02:13:50,747 --> 02:13:53,134
It's what we make for you. Yeah, we've asked all of our student work

2404
02:13:53,135 --> 02:13:55,331
that's been done. Be easy. Be easy.

2405
02:13:55,332 --> 02:13:58,310
Be easy. We can get it in more than a few minutes.

2406
02:13:58,323 --> 02:14:01,308
Oh, yeah. So,

2407
02:14:01,309 --> 02:14:04,091
no, I would like to say, yeah, we have a bunch of them.

2408
02:14:04,092 --> 02:14:06,891
Yeah, you can hear me. Yeah, I don't know if there's a lot of

2409
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:09,635
you on the screen. I mean, it's kind of, we get this up.

2410
02:14:09,636 --> 02:14:11,571
We're going to take a look at ourselves and see what we're doing right

2411
02:14:11,572 --> 02:14:14,269
here. Cutings, Ohh, that's the right choice,

2412
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:17,713
that's the best way to play the bad guys. Uhm, I'll have you open

2413
02:14:17,714 --> 02:14:19,835
with me. See you in the day like this. I think this is fine.

2414
02:14:19,836 --> 02:14:23,396
We'll in the next one. How are,

2415
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:27,001
uhm, you're using the work packages? Are they the letters to that or are

2416
02:14:27,002 --> 02:14:28,216
you getting them to me? I don't know how to use them either. Good.

2417
02:14:28,217 --> 02:14:31,392
They're not going to use them. There's a couple of them there that are

2418
02:14:31,393 --> 02:14:33,785
experiencing the calm, um, augmentation,

2419
02:14:33,786 --> 02:14:35,792
uhm, and you can see them,

2420
02:14:35,793 --> 02:14:38,106
you can see them- I'm in there, uhh,

2421
02:14:38,107 --> 02:14:40,125
hmmm,

2422
02:14:40,126 --> 02:14:45,202
hmmm. and ah,

2423
02:14:45,203 --> 02:14:48,091
just a minute. Alright.

2424
02:14:49,347 --> 02:14:51,597
Then you'll be like, oh, it's coming, she lives.

2425
02:14:51,598 --> 02:14:55,107
See you. All right. Alright, well thank you for all the other days,

2426
02:14:55,225 --> 02:14:59,364
to say that it's not a good meal that u're not pausing out the

2427
02:14:59,365 --> 02:15:02,173
recommendation. Alright, umm,

2428
02:15:02,183 --> 02:15:06,360
get back up to your filter, umm. Oh.

2429
02:15:08,411 --> 02:15:10,794
It shouldn't be. Yeah.

2430
02:15:10,795 --> 02:15:12,810
It shouldn't be both. Uh huh.

2431
02:15:16,451 --> 02:15:18,697
I don't even know.

2432
02:15:19,525 --> 02:15:22,150
Well, they just built them for a while. Let's complete it. Go back in

2433
02:15:22,151 --> 02:15:24,229
with the desktop with a little bit of fantasy, some of that. I'm sorry,

2434
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:28,847
I'm sorry. I'm going to vape that's production control and

2435
02:15:28,848 --> 02:15:32,227
work back in action. I have to still pose in any of the structures,

2436
02:15:32,228 --> 02:15:35,608
too. Sunjap, I'm passing you to Delpac,

2437
02:15:35,723 --> 02:15:38,374
Bluejap, Family, Pillies, Capave,

2438
02:15:38,375 --> 02:15:40,571
Spring Harbor, See ya'll in the next one. father.

2439
02:15:40,572 --> 02:15:43,892
It's obviously all the work I could do so. Yeah,

2440
02:15:43,893 --> 02:15:46,068
it's unchanging. It should have been completed,

2441
02:15:46,069 --> 02:15:48,616
but I'm not going to be able to it here. Thank you.

2442
02:15:48,617 --> 02:15:51,895
I don't think it's their drop-in button,

2443
02:15:51,896 --> 02:15:55,851
uhm. I don't think we'll look at that in the CPU.

2444
02:15:55,915 --> 02:15:59,026
Like, go up. I don't that. I don't think that's the one to put

2445
02:15:59,197 --> 02:16:00,400
in the rounds. Thank you very

2446
02:16:05,291 --> 02:16:10,201
It's still buggin' me that I'm doing that.

2447
02:16:10,958 --> 02:16:15,950
Every time I do. Every time I have. bad Thank

2448
02:16:15,951 --> 02:16:19,421
you for this question, I'm going to be listening to Brian Walsh,

2449
02:16:19,422 --> 02:16:21,717
okay. I'll serve you with um.

2450
02:16:21,727 --> 02:16:24,881
Bye-bye. Yeah.

2451
02:16:24,882 --> 02:16:27,818
See the dashboard productivity station?

2452
02:16:28,794 --> 02:16:34,636
Hit the little arrow. The The I don't want to talk about

2453
02:16:34,637 --> 02:16:37,241
this. So.

2454
02:16:37,242 --> 02:16:39,346
Hello. Alright,

2455
02:16:39,347 --> 02:16:44,321
so you gotta stand wide. Hit the drop button. So

2456
02:16:44,322 --> 02:16:48,819
you can, so this is where the- and the other one.

2457
02:16:49,649 --> 02:16:53,219
Yeah. So right now you got to say if the last station is complete

2458
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:55,942
then that's all. All right, Kelly. Thanks. Thank you, It's a And you can

2459
02:16:55,943 --> 02:16:58,352
key on whatever, whichever you saw.

2460
02:16:58,353 --> 02:17:00,421
Okay. So that's why it's, it's not really the last station.

2461
02:17:00,422 --> 02:17:02,782
Okay. I'm ahead and Now,

2462
02:17:02,783 --> 02:17:05,430
that move, within,

2463
02:17:05,431 --> 02:17:07,455
in, in, in, cleaning,

2464
02:17:07,623 --> 02:17:10,064
paint, towel, clean. Okay,

2465
02:17:10,065 --> 02:17:12,275
so. Look. It's a glass,

2466
02:17:12,276 --> 02:17:14,625
it's, it's, no, it's all over again. So.

2467
02:17:15,561 --> 02:17:17,666
Okay, knowledge, Jira, Silence, what was about?

2468
02:17:17,667 --> 02:17:22,293
Let's go. You would

2469
02:17:22,294 --> 02:17:26,004
probably want to make sure all the new ones that we get aren't saying

2470
02:17:26,005 --> 02:17:30,464
money, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and some of those probably reproductive changes we've

2471
02:17:30,465 --> 02:17:32,613
made in the run-up is now the worst.

2472
02:17:33,195 --> 02:17:35,296
I guess that they shouldn't be that way.

2473
02:17:35,297 --> 02:17:39,743
I noticed in there, if they were completed and then we adjusted the route

2474
02:17:39,744 --> 02:17:43,427
to see now that the last, there's a ten-hand last route without the- the

2475
02:17:43,428 --> 02:17:48,183
open end. So they're beginning to

2476
02:17:48,184 --> 02:17:50,818
open up for your open end of the end. Yes,

2477
02:17:51,039 --> 02:17:55,170
that's probably why. Yeah. Yeah. We added it to a typical production to get

2478
02:17:55,171 --> 02:17:58,719
out. And I'm here to see one of the packages that went down around

2479
02:17:58,876 --> 02:18:02,408
completing one. One. One. So, see you're bathing like on a little bit.

2480
02:18:02,575 --> 02:18:05,201
Yeah, you're right. Cause,

2481
02:18:05,209 --> 02:18:08,228
yeah, that would be the tip of that announcement.

2482
02:18:08,229 --> 02:18:10,268
and So, in some of these,

2483
02:18:10,269 --> 02:18:12,573
I always take a break and leave this for a while there.

2484
02:18:13,728 --> 02:18:16,032
Going to quarantine, going to the lawn.

2485
02:18:16,033 --> 02:18:18,602
On warm and we're pretty drained,

2486
02:18:18,603 --> 02:18:21,497
uhh, I mean you know, I don't know.

2487
02:18:21,498 --> 02:18:24,371
I'm all in, never think we're in.

2488
02:18:24,372 --> 02:18:26,922
I think he's gonna have a good job.

2489
02:18:26,923 --> 02:18:29,536
I don't know, yeah. I think he's gonna have a time.

2490
02:18:29,625 --> 02:18:31,837
I he's gonna have a good time. think he's gonna a good time.

2491
02:18:32,139 --> 02:18:34,428
Bye. I like Trello. I mean,

2492
02:18:34,429 --> 02:18:36,652
he's gonna spend money and all the scooting all the time. I don't know.

2493
02:18:36,679 --> 02:18:38,964
I to do. I don't know what to do.

2494
02:18:38,970 --> 02:18:41,397
Bye, I'm David. Bye. I'm I'm Alex. . This is Tim. I'm going right

2495
02:18:41,398 --> 02:18:44,153
and we're trying to figure out how to get you to the end of

2496
02:18:44,154 --> 02:18:47,283
the Along the way, you can keep laying on this jerk and we don't

2497
02:18:47,284 --> 02:18:50,219
want. Please. you you can clean me up,

2498
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:52,866
it's like a bike that you didn't.

2499
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:56,191
At least with this one, I don't think so. If I want it.

2500
02:18:56,192 --> 02:18:58,747
You need leave the struggling with a lot of projects, you can take them

2501
02:18:58,753 --> 02:19:01,304
out off of that, and that's what they need to project with as they're

2502
02:19:01,305 --> 02:19:03,630
starting to struggle out. Yes, for sure it's so.

2503
02:19:03,647 --> 02:19:07,502
Oh, no. Yeah, a little less than a struggle with the sum of the

2504
02:19:07,503 --> 02:19:11,001
other Jira, Lusuke, and I don't know how to work with it.

2505
02:19:11,567 --> 02:19:14,784
But first. Sorry. Let go to that.

2506
02:19:14,785 --> 02:19:17,378
And this one, this is what we do. You've got an upper one,

2507
02:19:17,379 --> 02:19:20,122
which I can probably just change, you know, complex route.

2508
02:19:20,123 --> 02:19:23,544
You know, The only difference with this is that it has a bit of

2509
02:19:23,545 --> 02:19:26,582
one, a bit of two, a well one, and a well child here.

2510
02:19:26,627 --> 02:19:29,989
So you'll be having seconds. First. I've been setting a stage longer on,

2511
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:32,061
uh, Compass, Confluence for that.

2512
02:19:32,062 --> 02:19:35,081
Yep. Uh, this one make incredible digits,

2513
02:19:35,082 --> 02:19:39,638
which community would hit. . I was glad I was not

2514
02:19:39,639 --> 02:19:42,101
alone in this series.

2515
02:19:44,574 --> 02:19:46,595
There we go. Jira,

2516
02:19:46,596 --> 02:19:53,351

uhm,

2531
02:20:39,085 --> 02:20:42,076
a little program to finalize all the stuff? I love I it.

2532
02:20:42,077 --> 02:20:45,232
Yeah, it was not open up by computer.

2536
02:20:52,015 --> 02:20:55,986
I have to say, the year's trial is over.

2537
02:20:55,987 --> 02:20:58,151
I haven't looked at it. I haven't looked at it.

2538
02:20:58,152 --> 02:21:00,342
Yeah,

2539
02:21:00,343 --> 02:21:05,660
I did more. He said it. Hey, hey. I think it was 84.

2540
02:21:05,661 --> 02:21:09,219
Be sure to subscribe to for more MediRoute, or so that even be done,

2541
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:12,349
it took 10 hours for a dude that he set up and wrote a

2542
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:14,950
computer and let it go and build up. . There's both,

2543
02:21:15,132 --> 02:21:18,767
two pots, six seconds, over, over,

2544
02:21:18,928 --> 02:21:21,348
we got it, you know, got it. So,

2545
02:21:21,349 --> 02:21:25,122
eh. I think so.

2546
02:21:25,123 --> 02:21:27,875
I think it's fine. I cannot believe it's considering what you love and what

2547
02:21:27,876 --> 02:21:31,055
Look. That's it. That's different.

2548
02:21:33,597 --> 02:21:36,493
That's all you want. That's the best.

2549
02:21:37,297 --> 02:21:39,492
That's all I want. The All the other ones.

2550
02:21:39,842 --> 02:21:42,273
So, I need to go out and do it.

2551
02:21:42,826 --> 02:21:45,305
Scrap it out. Scrap it Scrap it out. Take it.

2552
02:21:45,539 --> 02:21:47,658
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

2553
02:21:47,659 --> 02:21:51,996
Thank you. It's um, a lot of us,

2554
02:21:51,997 --> 02:21:56,850
e-mail. Thanks. I I'm going to take a break with my friends now.

2555
02:21:57,172 --> 02:22:00,146
That's it. All right.

2556
02:22:00,147 --> 02:22:25,949
You Come

2557
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:29,616
on. Bitbucket,

2558
02:22:29,617 --> 02:22:34,650
Straight to Mm-hmm.

2559
02:22:34,651 --> 02:22:39,991
and . X.

2560
02:22:39,992 --> 02:22:44,477
.

2561
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:48,963
.

2562
02:22:48,964 --> 02:22:53,450
.

2563
02:22:54,731 --> 02:22:56,949
Loom,

2564
02:22:56,950 --> 02:23:00,969
Jira, Loom, Jira, Loom, Jira,

2565
02:23:00,970 --> 02:23:03,560
Loom, Jira, Loom, MediRoute, Tension,

2566
02:23:03,561 --> 02:23:06,816
I think that's not just a new part of it. You think about it?

2567
02:23:06,893 --> 02:23:09,162
I'll just be ready for it. Yes!

2568
02:23:09,644 --> 02:23:14,170
Goodnight! You were asking me

2569
02:23:14,171 --> 02:23:18,643
about, you were asking about the wheelchair.

2570
02:23:18,644 --> 02:23:22,668
That's it. and MediRoute. So thank you for talking about that yesterday.

2571
02:23:22,967 --> 02:23:25,238
Yeah, for, uh,

2572
02:23:25,249 --> 02:23:28,479
the base hours, probably in the projects. I'll see you in a Uh,

2573
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:30,864
or, oh, the kids found, yeah, yeah, yeah,

2574
02:23:31,042 --> 02:23:34,936
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just thought. I'll see one.

2575
02:23:34,937 --> 02:23:38,306
I have fixed that in a specific way.

2576
02:23:38,806 --> 02:23:42,256
There's no way to turn it off, but you can set it so that

2577
02:23:42,257 --> 02:23:44,908
when it comes to- again, it gives you no time.

2578
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:47,657
Okay, you wanna look at that?

2579
02:23:47,658 --> 02:23:51,011
Yeah, check it out. Hey, Anderson. Listen.

2580
02:23:51,012 --> 02:23:55,951
Yeah, I did this level

2581
02:23:55,952 --> 02:23:59,259
up here with a client. Umm, if you go up to bait the- It's

2582
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:02,947
estimating, uh, labor maintenance and well.

2583
02:24:06,095 --> 02:24:09,351
And then go to- Like, uhm,

2584
02:24:09,362 --> 02:24:11,505
Phillip Wheel, Manual. Uh,

2585
02:24:11,516 --> 02:24:13,984
well, I think, uh, give it- give it give it a drop down top.

2586
02:24:13,985 --> 02:24:16,557
We'll make it strong down. And you in the and the well-tight maintenance.

2587
02:24:18,012 --> 02:24:20,046
And now I'm gonna fill up with a manual. Go.

2588
02:24:23,171 --> 02:24:27,758
Number six there. You see the well-tight landing down there at

2589
02:24:27,759 --> 02:24:30,763
the bottom right hand corner? When you're importing,

2590
02:24:30,764 --> 02:24:35,753
You That is the nomenclature for

2591
02:24:35,754 --> 02:24:39,491
the specific pipes and the main alternate in what they want to,

2592
02:24:39,492 --> 02:24:42,563
And so it says cool.

2593
02:24:42,875 --> 02:24:45,553
If I see Angelina as an example,

2594
02:24:45,554 --> 02:24:48,862
cool, more than like that I feel my name. and so that it changes

2595
02:24:48,863 --> 02:24:54,251
and feels well made. So what I've done is I'll create a normal type

2596
02:24:54,414 --> 02:24:58,018
here with- with zero rates or anything.

2597
02:24:58,182 --> 02:25:01,488
Take all these one of them type nags. Put it in the middle end

2598
02:25:01,489 --> 02:25:04,813
so that when they come in, you guys don't- raise to apply to them.

2599
02:25:04,814 --> 02:25:08,012
Umm, now, I've done that with,

2600
02:25:08,013 --> 02:25:10,928
umm, in morning that I've seen.

2601
02:25:10,929 --> 02:25:14,287
Thank you. I'm assuming it gets far worse the same,

2602
02:25:14,288 --> 02:25:16,521
but I'm not, I'm not interested in part of it. We just have to

2603
02:25:16,522 --> 02:25:19,576
try it out soon. Okay. We can follow what I'm saying.

2604
02:25:19,577 --> 02:25:21,851
Yeah. Do you want to try? Yeah,

2605
02:25:21,852 --> 02:25:24,493
let's do it. So they just do a new one and create,

2606
02:25:24,494 --> 02:25:26,986
uh, whatever you wanna call it, we wanna call it that way or whatever.

2607
02:25:26,987 --> 02:25:27,082
you

2608
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:41,167
Hm.

2609
02:25:41,168 --> 02:25:41,380
. .

2610
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:50,491
We're

2611
02:25:52,608 --> 02:25:55,214
all in though, alright. Alright. I have anything. By the way,

2612
02:25:55,215 --> 02:25:58,511
you see that convert with length exceed by the way.

2613
02:25:58,512 --> 02:26:00,632
That is a new thing as well.

2614
02:26:00,633 --> 02:26:02,951
You're back to me. Twenty-twenty-five eye.

2615
02:26:02,952 --> 02:26:05,156
Basically, you can set it to say,

2616
02:26:05,958 --> 02:26:08,803
if I have a will, just twenty feet.

2617
02:26:09,083 --> 02:26:11,634
Mm hmm. . Then, come up with some work.

2618
02:26:12,390 --> 02:26:14,803
So, uh, the phone must have all the delivery.

2619
02:26:14,804 --> 02:26:17,536
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

2620
02:26:17,537 --> 02:26:20,714
So, it's, they kinda built it for,

2621
02:26:20,715 --> 02:26:24,334
like, if I'm doing built up plenty of girders and stuff like that,

2622
02:26:24,335 --> 02:26:26,988
or pox, kylons and- and I've got it long and deep,

2623
02:26:26,989 --> 02:26:29,484
so I don't wanna do it right in the field,

2624
02:26:29,509 --> 02:26:31,953
and I'm gonna do a soundtrack, you know, or something like that.

2625
02:26:31,954 --> 02:26:35,017
So, that's what that's for. So at that,

2626
02:26:35,621 --> 02:26:38,771
and then we will, they'll be back to like,

2627
02:26:38,772 --> 02:26:41,531
fill a well manual. Cut. Good.

2628
02:26:41,532 --> 02:26:43,658
Cut all of those out on a well-tight bag,

2629
02:26:43,659 --> 02:26:47,638
and then save this here, then we'll go back over and we'll paste that

2630
02:26:47,654 --> 02:26:52,271
in and know well. . . and it's gonna be several other places

2631
02:26:52,272 --> 02:26:54,721
throughout here as well. So,

2632
02:26:54,745 --> 02:26:57,609
you'll have to give back to Mike, but I think there's a lot of

2633
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:59,854
all of the manuals to the Buckwell manual.

2634
02:26:59,861 --> 02:27:01,323
Yes, you can grab all that. Bye bye.

2635
02:27:23,531 --> 02:27:26,535
and Jira.

2636
02:27:26,536 --> 02:27:29,187
Okay, I'm trying to go out and plan next morning so I'm well on

2637
02:27:29,189 --> 02:27:31,511
pace for it. Okay.

2638
02:27:31,512 --> 02:27:36,076
In so much, I'm just getting files from the customer that has all

2639
02:27:36,077 --> 02:27:38,654
this already filled out. Yeah,

2640
02:27:38,655 --> 02:27:43,232
essentially they'll surprise us. And it'll all show up in

2641
02:27:43,233 --> 02:27:47,839
the instant extra to achieve after the one by one part-by-part assembly.

2642
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,995
so by Assembly, and uh,

2643
02:27:51,006 --> 02:27:55,666
and majority of the time, I mean, it doesn't have any connotation

2644
02:27:55,667 --> 02:27:57,923
to it. Thank . . Okay, quick, quick, potentially built in.

2645
02:27:58,281 --> 02:28:02,186
You could put those in and do a whole lot of take on mine

2646
02:28:02,187 --> 02:28:04,271
in the low case. That's all interesting.

2647
02:28:04,272 --> 02:28:08,802
The dwelling here makes sense, but lots of times

2648
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:11,676
they'll have like a six feet of well.

2649
02:28:11,677 --> 02:28:15,826
Y'all will. And, uh, a weird size of one that won't come in,

2650
02:28:15,983 --> 02:28:18,459
so a zero size fill it,

2651
02:28:18,595 --> 02:28:21,524
and then a bunch of inches. We'll see you next week. or it'll be

2652
02:28:21,525 --> 02:28:26,706
like a one inch to it and then it'll be like 300

2653
02:28:26,707 --> 02:28:31,760
of them and one inch. Long and it just doesn't even justify

2654
02:28:31,761 --> 02:28:33,957
until what you're trying to build. Uh,

2655
02:28:33,967 --> 02:28:36,431
so it doesn't only seem recognized properly. Thank joining us.

2656
02:28:36,432 --> 02:28:39,864
And then also just add a lot of time and I'm going to do

2657
02:28:39,865 --> 02:28:43,468
a later code and run this through to lay it on and through,

2658
02:28:43,469 --> 02:28:49,013
uh, as time- I've never seen a detailer yet get all the welds

2659
02:28:49,014 --> 02:28:51,786
right in the model. Uh,

2660
02:28:51,796 --> 02:28:54,527
I mean, most- the jobs that I think come through,

2661
02:28:54,781 --> 02:28:57,502
like on a, uh, like a shoe pad.

2662
02:28:57,713 --> 02:29:00,551
I'll see you in one one side, about the other side.

2663
02:29:00,552 --> 02:29:05,296
It's like, I've got half the wheel that's worse than I'm not having anything

2664
02:29:05,297 --> 02:29:07,519
at all because I can apply it to the labor case,

2665
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:12,197
so. Good. Yeah. I like ignoring the wheels

2666
02:29:12,198 --> 02:29:16,571
if I can. It just makes no sense.

2667
02:29:16,572 --> 02:29:21,571
So

2668
02:29:22,475 --> 02:29:24,676
I'll have to take it and check it as it goes through.

2669
02:29:24,677 --> 02:29:28,637
. . Climbouts, Correctly, Emmingle. So you can find it.

2670
02:29:29,096 --> 02:29:31,202
You can find it. It depends on the spot here.

2671
02:29:31,203 --> 02:29:33,329
Thank you. It's,

2672
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:37,008
it's, it's, it's relatively easy to do,

2673
02:29:37,787 --> 02:29:39,946
but especially if you don't want to man you take off, because you're going

2674
02:29:39,947 --> 02:29:42,524
to apply to me. You're going to be repeating it through,

2675
02:29:42,965 --> 02:29:45,830
but it's not difficult not to do,

2676
02:29:46,815 --> 02:29:50,012
if you, uhh. you Cause you can play it,

2677
02:29:50,013 --> 02:29:53,796
even like pick up cheater pants, if I can identify how the cheater pants,

2678
02:29:54,086 --> 02:29:56,751
and then say, apply one kick at that, it's just my wife.

2679
02:29:56,752 --> 02:30:00,517
Bye! Okay, which was worked on the length of the plate.

2680
02:30:00,534 --> 02:30:03,511
So, umm, it's not difficult to do,

2681
02:30:03,512 --> 02:30:06,321
as long as you're gonna do that. I love the pieces. If I can't

2682
02:30:06,322 --> 02:30:09,797
identify the pieces, I don't have a problem.

2683
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:16,138
I don't know what, what to apply. Bye I'm going to say

2684
02:30:16,305 --> 02:30:18,589
he's a circuit and go,

2685
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:20,402
step from this, this is not a guy, this is actually going to be

2686
02:30:20,403 --> 02:30:20,700
that fun. Bye.

2687
02:30:28,991 --> 02:30:34,211
I'm pretty glad to have all those sections.

2688
02:30:34,722 --> 02:30:37,036
You got CJP's.

2689
02:30:37,037 --> 02:30:39,223
. . EJ Pins,

2690
02:30:40,735 --> 02:30:42,816
Natural Blacks, IndiRoute.

2691
02:30:44,095 --> 02:30:46,937
No. No. This one's a,

2692
02:30:46,938 --> 02:30:49,278
uh, pressure with a 40-day job,

2693
02:30:49,279 --> 02:30:51,309
50. And,

2694
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:54,259
uh, he was giving a while. A couple of two things.

2695
02:30:54,895 --> 02:30:57,152
He gave calls. But,

2696
02:30:57,153 --> 02:30:59,621
uhm, you don't have to make both of the seconds of it.

2697
02:30:59,622 --> 02:31:04,291
You're gonna catch with this. . . . Just get in here running my

2698
02:31:04,292 --> 02:31:07,959
passes with partner. So a lot of times I'll be a labor code to

2699
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:10,057
get the Bitbucket. and Eric,

2700
02:31:10,276 --> 02:31:13,802
and then some of the love in ours, and I'll add in this bit

2701
02:31:13,803 --> 02:31:16,964
of extra to account for the additional love.

2702
02:31:16,965 --> 02:31:21,128
Bye-bye. and additional time. This is one where I had to add heating and

2703
02:31:21,129 --> 02:31:24,627
plates. We got three each plates, sittin' while in the flanges.

2704
02:31:24,987 --> 02:31:25,271
So-

2705
02:31:30,588 --> 02:31:32,577
And this one was tied every four minutes of the line, and this is

2706
02:31:32,578 --> 02:31:34,649
set five where it was. So as you- But you can build that. I

2707
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:37,191
mean, in fact there's a labor code for the web.

2708
02:31:37,812 --> 02:31:40,519
It's the uh, uhm,

2709
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:43,718
uhm, uhm, okay. . . . select, that's for the 4-speed wheel now.

2710
02:31:43,719 --> 02:31:47,770
There's nothing that says whether it's,

2711
02:31:47,771 --> 02:31:51,113
uh, C and then we're delving with them,

2712
02:31:51,114 --> 02:31:54,999
but I'm, you can feel that. But there is a labor code for the

2713
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,638
welding code there, the pre-deaf- that can be built into it as

2714
02:31:59,639 --> 02:32:04,452
well. I've kind of built it in with, um, with all

2715
02:32:04,453 --> 02:32:08,339
the plate labor code. . . I have pretty heat in there for me.

2716
02:32:08,627 --> 02:32:10,759
If any of them are certain size,

2717
02:32:10,845 --> 02:32:13,511
certain size, of course you have a pretty heat use percent.

2718
02:32:13,512 --> 02:32:18,021
That would be important. But all that can be built in

2719
02:32:18,022 --> 02:32:20,321
without you and you do it manually. So.

2720
02:32:20,829 --> 02:32:25,475
Good. and they're going to find that piece by piece if

2721
02:32:25,476 --> 02:32:28,194
you're, yeah, if you're, umm,

2722
02:32:28,204 --> 02:32:30,241
which most people are donating. all the way. I'm to take that off on

2723
02:32:30,242 --> 02:32:32,800
this as we're going to anyway. There ain't anything to be seen since I've

2724
02:32:32,801 --> 02:32:35,045
been entering the feature because I can't got it.

2725
02:32:35,823 --> 02:32:40,055
If I'm importing it from someone. I where which is.

2726
02:32:40,056 --> 02:32:42,942
It's in the sea. Mudshops don't make that noise.

2727
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:45,651
But if I'm even for it again, then I gotta slow.

2728
02:32:45,652 --> 02:32:49,656
below. It's, it's fairly neat,

2729
02:32:49,657 --> 02:32:52,900
you know, because.

2730
02:32:52,901 --> 02:32:55,077
We're going to have We'll hear this on the website. So,

2731
02:32:55,181 --> 02:32:57,411
what flavor do I plot? I'm going to tell you how.

2732
02:32:57,908 --> 02:33:01,016
Once again, you can import it, then we don't want to be in.

2733
02:33:01,017 --> 02:33:04,715
Uh. I'm. Pause. Do you have any country in?

2734
02:33:04,716 --> 02:33:06,931
Um, but what,

2735
02:33:07,532 --> 02:33:09,583
what it doesn't know about is, okay, cool.

2736
02:33:09,584 --> 02:33:11,870
What? . I've fed up laying out QC,

2737
02:33:12,083 --> 02:33:14,962
you know, awkward social stuff back there and saw that I had to get

2738
02:33:15,005 --> 02:33:17,836
in there. So, that neighborhood can be held simply.

2739
02:33:17,837 --> 02:33:22,453
So, I don't know. I'm going to realize you're going to go back

2740
02:33:22,454 --> 02:33:24,604
through the piece by piece, that's the reason for this. Yeah. Yeah.

2741
02:33:25,388 --> 02:33:28,086
Yeah. All right. . . I let, unless you want to know,

2742
02:33:28,102 --> 02:33:31,453
you just want to get part of her tongue thing on it,

2743
02:33:31,454 --> 02:33:33,524
which scared the shit out of it.

2744
02:33:33,572 --> 02:33:37,330
You know. There's some people who do that,

2745
02:33:37,550 --> 02:33:40,431
and they'll spit out a lot of estimates from me and experience me when

2746
02:33:40,432 --> 02:33:43,321
I'm happy. So. So we have viewers who have this here,

2747
02:33:43,322 --> 02:33:46,765
and I haven't figured that out yet. Yeah, yeah. Yeah,

2748
02:33:46,766 --> 02:33:49,868
this one, I haven't figured this one out yet. It's piece by piece.

2749
02:33:49,869 --> 02:33:52,020
Thanks. Yeah. If the D,

2750
02:33:52,021 --> 02:33:55,477
if I'm the important son.

2751
02:33:55,478 --> 02:33:58,031
So,

2752
02:33:58,032 --> 02:34:01,221
the detailer has some label nicely.

2753
02:34:01,803 --> 02:34:05,516
You can very quickly wiggle it and pick all the columns,

2754
02:34:05,517 --> 02:34:10,021
put one. a It can

2755
02:34:10,022 --> 02:34:14,111
be very quick that way.

2756
02:34:14,112 --> 02:34:16,996
Detailer is a good job. Detailer doesn't like anything.

2757
02:34:17,559 --> 02:34:19,650
Oh, man, it can be a pain. Hey,

2758
02:34:19,651 --> 02:34:22,156
y'all, I have not seen a period without you. Uh-uh.

2759
02:34:22,157 --> 02:34:24,953
. Now,

2760
02:34:24,954 --> 02:34:27,210
with AI,

2761
02:34:27,211 --> 02:34:29,148
so with, like, with AI, I think I was talking about, um. And is

2762
02:34:29,149 --> 02:34:33,272
the one. It will actually be in the connections,

2763
02:34:34,009 --> 02:34:37,132
and put their names, and then we'll put a code on all that for

2764
02:34:37,176 --> 02:34:39,555
you. So, yes. But if I've got a model,

2765
02:34:39,615 --> 02:34:44,563
then I import it. I have some

2766
02:34:44,564 --> 02:34:49,520
details about really, really that. Yeah.

2767
02:34:49,521 --> 02:34:51,341
Shoot from the gun. Yeah. Well, when you say take care of her, to

2768
02:34:51,342 --> 02:34:56,075
me. Umm. And these are either

2769
02:34:56,076 --> 02:34:58,595
an external detail or as part of a good process,

2770
02:34:59,356 --> 02:35:02,356
or if you're a bit of a child, you may not have gotten.

2771
02:35:02,357 --> 02:35:04,637
If you just have,

2772
02:35:05,588 --> 02:35:07,953
maybe you have 10 files, maybe you don't.

2773
02:35:07,966 --> 02:35:12,822
Yeah. I do have a point. Bye That's about to

2774
02:35:12,823 --> 02:35:17,182
have, um, they have 130 cameras on a container, a monthly container for X

2775
02:35:17,291 --> 02:35:20,035
number of tons. you And they'll,

2776
02:35:20,036 --> 02:35:23,340
they'll have them pretty well for every, every distance like they do.

2777
02:35:23,940 --> 02:35:26,236
And, like, I don't know, client, I'm sure to,

2778
02:35:26,237 --> 02:35:29,542
that's, That's part of their, I don't blame you now,

2779
02:35:29,543 --> 02:35:32,599
Colin, where every other distance comes you with a ball,

2780
02:35:32,722 --> 02:35:35,006
all you do, and I'm talking about the, Yeah, well,

2781
02:35:35,007 --> 02:35:39,522
with the miscellaneous and heritage again, which is really a little bit extreme,

2782
02:35:39,523 --> 02:35:41,804
but that's kind of their, uh,

2783
02:35:41,815 --> 02:35:44,193
that's what they're kind of- known for where it is sales,

2784
02:35:44,194 --> 02:35:47,825
too. But, you know, what they're paying for in years of journalism.

2785
02:35:48,185 --> 02:35:51,273
Yeah, they're creating a model for the- estimate.

2786
02:35:51,646 --> 02:35:54,259
They'll import it even with the labor, uh,

2787
02:35:54,269 --> 02:35:57,362
estimate that the model goes to the client with it and says,

2788
02:35:57,756 --> 02:36:00,315
we're done. Good luck. Nice talk of that and we can,

2789
02:36:00,316 --> 02:36:03,536
uh, take it somewhere, do a pentagram.

2790
02:36:03,537 --> 02:36:05,738
We'll see you in a sec. What else is in here?

2791
02:36:05,739 --> 02:36:07,758
Here. Get back Uhh,

2792
02:36:07,769 --> 02:36:11,677
it kind of depends on the wellness that the estimating department is doing.

2793
02:36:11,678 --> 02:36:14,513
It's, if you want to.

2794
02:36:14,514 --> 02:36:16,843
Thank you, sir. The production of mine is,

2795
02:36:16,844 --> 02:36:19,216
you don't want it to move you, you're building your own assembly to open

2796
02:36:19,217 --> 02:36:24,169
your structures and gear. That's why the parametric- You assembly is from the ability

2797
02:36:24,222 --> 02:36:27,442
to hear me, um, to figure out what you have in there and the

2798
02:36:27,443 --> 02:36:29,714
estimators having it all, uh,

2799
02:36:29,724 --> 02:36:32,726
because then you can. you You can go in there and enter your friend,

2800
02:36:32,727 --> 02:36:36,789
because I have a staircase that's this long, you just fall in this many

2801
02:36:36,790 --> 02:36:39,806
treads, and then you just put it all in. you and then copy those

2802
02:36:39,807 --> 02:36:42,717
all the material you need for it, because you've got to go in and

2803
02:36:42,718 --> 02:36:46,087
select the structures that you're going to see in this one up here.

2804
02:36:46,088 --> 02:36:49,049
You I don't know any of the type of instructions,

2805
02:36:49,050 --> 02:36:51,942
nobody uses type of instructions. So,

2806
02:36:51,943 --> 02:36:54,851
uhm, for the stuff that I,

2807
02:36:54,852 --> 02:36:58,819
you, I've made bad work with a fountain,

2808
02:36:58,820 --> 02:37:01,204
which no more. So, I've made thoughts.

2809
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:03,566
I've made I don't pre-step,

2810
02:37:03,567 --> 02:37:06,280
but we're gonna get it here. I get a kiss while,

2811
02:37:06,281 --> 02:37:10,417
I get a model, I get- I don't always get a model with it.

2812
02:37:10,492 --> 02:37:13,268
Good. Good. And generally I always get a kiss while,

2813
02:37:13,269 --> 02:37:16,542
and I get it detailed about shot prints.

2814
02:37:17,068 --> 02:37:19,831
This is what the building needs to be. Use your longness.

2815
02:37:20,770 --> 02:37:24,385
It might be in red ink, or sometimes your skin fits in.

2816
02:37:24,386 --> 02:37:26,896
Umm, okay. Umm. Yes.

2817
02:37:26,897 --> 02:37:30,332
as is that the price, contingent on no changes between R and A and

2818
02:37:30,333 --> 02:37:33,863
M0, and then, and if I get that 0,

2819
02:37:33,864 --> 02:37:39,248
I'll add 10 to the But

2820
02:37:39,249 --> 02:37:42,911
I do think you were the- I'll do this.

2821
02:37:42,912 --> 02:37:47,057
Umm, you'll get better buy-in from the rest of the estimators.

2822
02:37:47,874 --> 02:37:52,057
If you bill out some more stuff in here such as- different labor cases

2823
02:37:52,058 --> 02:37:56,255
though. Yeah. If they're gonna have to do a lot of manual adjustments on

2824
02:37:56,256 --> 02:37:59,414
each one for some of that stuff, it's- it's gonna be- It can be.

2825
02:37:59,415 --> 02:38:02,976
And so, that's the key to the labor cases.

2826
02:38:02,977 --> 02:38:05,311
It just makes it super simple. Um.

2827
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:07,549
Come on. So that,

2828
02:38:07,679 --> 02:38:11,199
that would be a key to get by and I think it's building that

2829
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,270
out a little bit more. But it's somebody,

2830
02:38:13,581 --> 02:38:18,207
you know, Tecla has, And

2831
02:38:18,208 --> 02:38:22,584
you go and teach people how to do it,

2832
02:38:22,585 --> 02:38:24,690
Good. Good. Sometimes they're all gonna be a thing.

2833
02:38:25,167 --> 02:38:28,950
But now I feel like you're taught kind of an act way in the

2834
02:38:28,951 --> 02:38:32,557
suite, right? In the UK? I've got all this stuff you wish would build

2835
02:38:32,558 --> 02:38:34,655
out. Well, maybe,

2836
02:38:35,093 --> 02:38:37,628
if I'm doing a big job, I'll build it.

2837
02:38:38,353 --> 02:38:40,549
Come on! I'd be quite kind of sitting there and you're going to meet

2838
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:43,572
your own. I know, I'll build it in your toast. If it's something,

2839
02:38:43,573 --> 02:38:45,731
I shouldn't have found any, uh, like,

2840
02:38:45,732 --> 02:38:49,195
any of these to toast. Uhh, I don't see much sheep anyway,

2841
02:38:49,196 --> 02:38:52,412
but it helps me, yeah, it helps me to start with all the great

2842
02:38:52,413 --> 02:38:54,911
gallons of blooming. Most of the time,

2843
02:38:54,912 --> 02:38:59,379
It's increasing the number of fillets for increasing the well size and increasing all

2844
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:02,956
that. I'm feeling here, and I think this is synthesis.

2845
02:39:02,957 --> 02:39:05,870
In all our estimates, so many of you can leave it at a classroom,

2846
02:39:05,871 --> 02:39:09,279
right? They were thought to have to be maybe the morning time machine correctly.

2847
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,634
Uh, uhm. but uh,

2848
02:39:11,645 --> 02:39:15,862
in here in the labor field it's more out of a tight and then

2849
02:39:15,863 --> 02:39:18,390
the velvet size. And then the tight,

2850
02:39:18,391 --> 02:39:22,044
it's just there. Everything in your default support range so that I won't go

2851
02:39:22,045 --> 02:39:24,884
in and opt in, I'm gonna leave it go up.

2852
02:39:24,885 --> 02:39:30,158
Umm, same color. Hello. Add

2853
02:39:30,159 --> 02:39:32,264
a clip, see and go,

2854
02:39:32,265 --> 02:39:34,286
add a description, and then for there, I'll leave that and I'll run it

2855
02:39:34,287 --> 02:39:40,310
across the phone. I

2856
02:39:40,311 --> 02:39:42,303
usually try it out with a teeny pop plex with it, but usually it's

2857
02:39:42,304 --> 02:39:42,971
just a solid size of increasing so that a lot of money. Let's go.

2858
02:39:42,972 --> 02:39:47,885
Umm, when you say product across

2859
02:39:47,886 --> 02:39:50,800
the whole project.

2860
02:39:48,677 --> 02:39:53,238
Husband you still have to identify how many of

2861
02:39:53,239 --> 02:39:57,748
you have worked. Yeah, start up on 10 or 15 lines and

2862
02:39:57,749 --> 02:40:00,321
go on the player again. At least at this time,

2863
02:40:00,322 --> 02:40:04,798
5.50, and I don't have a welcome here at 5.16.

2864
02:40:04,799 --> 02:40:09,256
Then I'll come in and I'll free Italian. You have 5.16 and Y,

2865
02:40:09,257 --> 02:40:11,371
5.16 and Z, 5.16. So, uh,

2866
02:40:11,381 --> 02:40:13,559
when I go through the next 95 rounds,

2867
02:40:13,838 --> 02:40:16,100
I'm just going to try to sustain the moment,

2868
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:19,080
and it's not on that moment, I'm here. Instead of,

2869
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:22,560
you know, I was 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

2870
02:40:22,561 --> 02:40:27,513
No. It's incredibly interesting to me to only get that point in my opinion.

2871
02:40:27,812 --> 02:40:30,080
If I do it that way,

2872
02:40:30,188 --> 02:40:33,061
then so. So I do this at a time for a range.

2873
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:36,297
I'm going to let you out the world, going down to the original part

2874
02:40:36,298 --> 02:40:38,696
here, you know. I'm at 16th of a minute,

2875
02:40:38,697 --> 02:40:43,240
so. you know, I'm just technically giving you to

2876
02:40:43,241 --> 02:40:46,820
the same point, but the better way to do it is to adjust.

2877
02:40:46,821 --> 02:40:50,552
Yeah. So we have a product with the endings, you know, over in the

2878
02:40:50,553 --> 02:40:52,605
pockets that we have such, you know. So,

2879
02:40:52,606 --> 02:40:55,031
sir, do you order to send me the good? Yeah. Yeah.

2880
02:40:58,765 --> 02:41:01,988
Yeah, come on. You need any technical estimates? Yeah. Uh, I think we'll create

2881
02:41:01,989 --> 02:41:06,417
it. If there's, . . If there's a partnership with one specific development for

2882
02:41:06,418 --> 02:41:11,167
a specific labor call-out, he has not even

2883
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:15,082
what happens. I'm here, I'm not 100% certain.

2884
02:41:15,122 --> 02:41:17,874
He has come up with us to get all around when we are confident.

2885
02:41:17,875 --> 02:41:22,436
Uhm, here. Thank you. Pretty straight forward and you can duplicate it all

2886
02:41:22,437 --> 02:41:25,579
and you can kind of adjust it, but, um,

2887
02:41:25,589 --> 02:41:27,736
if you don't know, you can easily,

2888
02:41:27,737 --> 02:41:33,370
I have one and I'll fly it to an interior project and then,cheese.

2889
02:41:33,566 --> 02:41:35,711
So, that kind of restr- And see you time.

2890
02:41:35,712 --> 02:41:40,312
I'm that the law is adding the codes for Mama's the one

2891
02:41:40,313 --> 02:41:43,751
who's telling his team members to buy a lab. I'm sorry,

2892
02:41:43,752 --> 02:41:46,604
I had an old Y716 in there.

2893
02:41:46,875 --> 02:41:50,455
I had a where I had so many well that I was 716.

2894
02:41:50,456 --> 02:41:52,861
This is gonna get you that. Thanks I'm in of this type,

2895
02:41:53,309 --> 02:41:55,974
and uh, and this is what you're using for.

2896
02:41:56,444 --> 02:41:59,392
And now I'm doing the same thing as I have in something.

2897
02:41:59,393 --> 02:42:01,507
Thank you very much. Though, like, hey,

2898
02:42:01,508 --> 02:42:04,474
uh, I was, uh, excuse me, be for seat plates,

2899
02:42:04,475 --> 02:42:07,640
and every single seat plan on my project is 3-8.

2900
02:42:07,756 --> 02:42:10,323
Well, then, I had the e3-8's in there,

2901
02:42:10,372 --> 02:42:13,343
I'll talk to them on the end of the year in case you need

2902
02:42:13,344 --> 02:42:17,211
it, whether anybody else know. But- They will he see it,

2903
02:42:17,556 --> 02:42:20,830
because he's- Yeah, it's the same folder, right? You can see the folder on

2904
02:42:20,831 --> 02:42:22,996
the other side of the drop-downs or Apucket,

2905
02:42:23,033 --> 02:42:25,752
possibly more. Bye. So, uhh,

2906
02:42:25,763 --> 02:42:28,113
most of the adjustments that we have to focus on.

2907
02:42:28,114 --> 02:42:31,197
We're- we're- we're kind of just wiping up the light and go right now,

2908
02:42:31,198 --> 02:42:33,894
right? Yeah, I've got, uh,

2909
02:42:33,905 --> 02:42:36,986
a life smaller than you and everyone. Do you wanna see,

2910
02:42:36,987 --> 02:42:39,572
um, two things I- I think.

2911
02:42:39,573 --> 02:42:41,840
Thank you. And since we've got to run it,

2912
02:42:41,907 --> 02:42:45,299
we ran through it. Do you wanna see that?

2913
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,776
They have a tape-off thing for one thing. Yeah. Yeah.

2914
02:42:47,777 --> 02:42:49,935
And another thing, um,

2915
02:42:49,946 --> 02:42:54,689
there are 30 sun labor codes that came out of the box that are-

2916
02:42:55,119 --> 02:42:58,863
need to be- Thank you. Justin, I can't have the wheel being or something

2917
02:42:58,864 --> 02:43:02,097
on it. I think similar as we did in Justin's 2 last time,

2918
02:43:02,098 --> 02:43:04,126
I I think it deals- Yeah,

2919
02:43:04,127 --> 02:43:08,861
that would be, that would be an awesome- Thank

2920
02:43:08,862 --> 02:43:11,771
you all, good.

2921
02:43:11,772 --> 02:43:14,308
So, if get this first, you won't see that. Hey, now by everybody wants

2922
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:17,102
to Let's do an interesting first, because it's probably the part of working.

2923
02:43:17,103 --> 02:43:19,811
If to, uh, see the girls to,

2924
02:43:19,812 --> 02:43:23,722
. Uhm,

2925
02:43:23,733 --> 02:43:26,169
so let's start at annual good at the Ecode.

2926
02:43:26,170 --> 02:43:30,132
Good. Yeah,

2927
02:43:30,595 --> 02:43:32,777
not there. Yeah, first click on the D,

2928
02:43:32,983 --> 02:43:40,056
Lamborghini right there for angles. Okay. All right. Umm.

2929
02:43:40,067 --> 02:43:43,058
See the welding right there?

2930
02:43:43,059 --> 02:43:46,459
It says to fill it well. home. It's at the quarter of each time

2931
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:50,623
it's a perimeter, standard clip P. Uhm,

2932
02:43:50,634 --> 02:43:54,999
notice this too. It's Is It should be full because there's four of them.

2933
02:43:55,866 --> 02:43:58,177
So, bump that up.

2934
02:44:00,419 --> 02:44:02,470
And the reason- that standard clip, P,

2935
02:44:02,471 --> 02:44:05,472
says only two. That's putting clips on there,

2936
02:44:05,473 --> 02:44:07,834
right? But in the standard clips,

2937
02:44:07,835 --> 02:44:10,364
it says there's two. You know these clips,

2938
02:44:10,678 --> 02:44:14,480
so two sides, two comes two gets you four,

2939
02:44:14,677 --> 02:44:17,116
but it's not the same way with the wheels. You're welcome.

2940
02:44:17,117 --> 02:44:20,795
And so they've got that screwed up. E is going to be the same

2941
02:44:20,796 --> 02:44:25,007
way. It's just where the clips are running, but you've got one clip welded.

2942
02:44:25,008 --> 02:44:28,521
Mhm. Okay,

2943
02:44:28,522 --> 02:44:32,311
I don't know how often this is going to get used anyway.

2944
02:44:32,312 --> 02:44:34,513
Bye bye. This is how it lands.

2945
02:44:34,715 --> 02:44:37,606
Yeah, full pin print on two ends,

2946
02:44:38,095 --> 02:44:40,112
but this is screwed up as well.

2947
02:44:40,207 --> 02:44:42,914
But if you never- We don't need to worry about it.

2948
02:44:43,652 --> 02:44:46,962
So just, I mean, that'll be more on the instance.

2949
02:44:46,963 --> 02:44:49,271
Hey, while I have a job that is 40. for you.

2950
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:53,467
You know, I don't want that to be a frickin' law guy to

2951
02:44:53,468 --> 02:44:55,962
be that way. Yes, you seem there,

2952
02:44:55,963 --> 02:44:59,475
it's his burden. So, let's see,

2953
02:44:59,476 --> 02:45:03,036
oh, that's his parameter.

2954
02:45:04,210 --> 02:45:07,782
The, uhh. So, the burn,

2955
02:45:08,102 --> 02:45:11,098
it says to do that burning at the thickness times the width.

2956
02:45:11,099 --> 02:45:13,716
Thanks and next video. Well,

2957
02:45:13,717 --> 02:45:17,213
that makes no sense for an angle. That makes sense for a piece of

2958
02:45:17,214 --> 02:45:19,479
point. Yeah,

2959
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:23,032
so we gotta modify that. All formula in order,

2960
02:45:23,274 --> 02:45:27,834
or we'll create another formula to say around the perimeter of

2961
02:45:27,835 --> 02:45:30,190
the angle. We could say. Amen. Long,

2962
02:45:30,191 --> 02:45:33,085
long, short leg. There's various ways to say this,

2963
02:45:33,086 --> 02:45:33,405
but,

2964
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:40,976
Umm. Mm-hmm.

2965
02:45:45,731 --> 02:45:48,032
That one did,

2966
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:51,219
so it was new on that and it will change a bar,

2967
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:53,831
uhh, width down there.

2968
02:45:53,832 --> 02:46:01,811
. . and it like formula get rid of width and

2969
02:46:01,812 --> 02:46:04,101
I would probably just do perimeter.

2970
02:46:06,906 --> 02:46:09,174
Yep, there we go.

2971
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:16,711
Oh,

2972
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:19,403
it's E-pat. Oh, no, we didn't. I'm sorry.

2973
02:46:19,404 --> 02:46:22,084
We'll see you No,

2974
02:46:22,085 --> 02:46:24,907
we didn't get rid of it at all.

2975
02:46:24,908 --> 02:46:28,183
Uhm, it's, it's probably used on plate labor and awesome.

2976
02:46:28,184 --> 02:46:29,560
I had probably d- It's, . . .

2977
02:46:45,851 --> 02:46:50,851
and

2978
02:46:51,646 --> 02:46:54,205
then Alan would be the same thing except for just- one end.

2979
02:46:54,206 --> 02:46:54,424
You

2980
02:47:01,931 --> 02:47:06,494
How about the kid?

2981
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:09,965
Oh. Oh.

2982
02:47:09,966 --> 02:47:12,429
It shouldn't have well there. That's only on the end.

2983
02:47:13,068 --> 02:47:15,638
So get rid of the well. This is just full pin prep.

2984
02:47:15,639 --> 02:47:18,544
for it. Umm,

2985
02:47:18,554 --> 02:47:22,995
yeah. Yes. Yeah.

2986
02:47:23,828 --> 02:47:26,051
Open world. We'll see you minute.

2987
02:47:26,052 --> 02:47:28,294
So.

2988
02:47:42,131 --> 02:47:47,131
and

2989
02:47:47,142 --> 02:47:49,184
the Oak, um, came there.

2990
02:47:49,185 --> 02:47:52,392
Thank you. Now,

2991
02:47:52,599 --> 02:47:54,601
once again, is this ever going to happen?

2992
02:47:54,602 --> 02:47:56,764
You books look clips on communities of the day.

2993
02:47:57,056 --> 02:47:59,160
It's not like they're really- I can't do that, right?

2994
02:47:59,512 --> 02:48:01,996
Mm. But this is wrong.

2995
02:48:01,997 --> 02:48:05,312
It's got wellening for one clip. But anyway,

2996
02:48:05,313 --> 02:48:07,843
last one will change by- I know you're here.

2997
02:48:07,844 --> 02:48:10,007
It's the reason he looked for some stuff.

2998
02:48:12,807 --> 02:48:14,896
Yeah. Um. Love.

2999
02:48:14,897 --> 02:48:18,093
Alright, good of beams. Indeed.

3000
02:48:18,997 --> 02:48:22,349
Same deal. Well, if that's both ends, we need to get more welding out

3001
02:48:22,350 --> 02:48:24,993
there. Good. And with e as well.

3002
02:48:24,994 --> 02:48:28,895
Umm,

3003
02:48:28,906 --> 02:48:33,471
go down to K. Ready? So we got full pen prep on

3004
02:48:33,752 --> 02:48:35,822
both ends of the beam. Umm,

3005
02:48:35,833 --> 02:48:40,581
different. Alright, let's do fabricators want something

3006
02:48:40,582 --> 02:48:45,443
different here. So this is full pen prep and it's only doing

3007
02:48:45,444 --> 02:48:47,665
stuff on the, on the front. Langers,

3008
02:48:47,912 --> 02:48:50,105
nothing in the weather. So,

3009
02:48:50,618 --> 02:48:52,758
I would have some fabricators that are like,

3010
02:48:52,791 --> 02:48:54,916
yeah, let's just go and play on the phone.

3011
02:48:54,917 --> 02:49:00,792
. I just pointed out, because it's

3012
02:49:00,793 --> 02:49:02,891
only hanley.

3013
02:49:02,892 --> 02:49:06,582
It's not going hard off inches. Which is primal.

3014
02:49:06,738 --> 02:49:09,269
Make it seem to us, and make it that way. It happens.

3015
02:49:09,329 --> 02:49:12,324
It's not going to do it. Right. Right? So,

3016
02:49:12,325 --> 02:49:16,089
I just point that one out, cause I've had some that wants something happening.

3017
02:49:16,235 --> 02:49:18,527
And then, ehm, go to ehm,

3018
02:49:18,528 --> 02:49:21,471
four p- and prep and weld. Okay.

3019
02:49:21,682 --> 02:49:26,183
So, this is getting welding on

3020
02:49:26,184 --> 02:49:30,249
the flange. and just, So, this is right with everything in the flange.

3021
02:49:30,802 --> 02:49:34,137
Oh, there's a lot of, uh, feeling weld in the wear of this winkle.

3022
02:49:34,275 --> 02:49:37,213
Yeah. Yes. So, nothing's happening in the,

3023
02:49:37,214 --> 02:49:39,489
well, in the way of the year. So,

3024
02:49:39,490 --> 02:49:46,733
do the, uh, yeah. Yeah. So,

3025
02:49:46,734 --> 02:49:50,030
I would probably just, I feel like we have this all we want there,

3026
02:49:50,031 --> 02:49:52,267
right, in the low end. Thank you Thank you. So,

3027
02:49:52,429 --> 02:49:55,029
then you got to figure out, okay, what size fill it will do.

3028
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:57,866
And we might have to create a formula because we're going to need to

3029
02:49:57,867 --> 02:49:59,940
fill it well. I love it.

3030
02:49:59,941 --> 02:50:01,977
Umm, along the pressure,

3031
02:50:01,978 --> 02:50:02,657
okay.

3032
02:50:08,951 --> 02:50:13,200
Okay,

3033
02:50:13,201 --> 02:50:16,426
so we're at the lane, so yeah,

3034
02:50:16,427 --> 02:50:17,910
unless we see something that says it. .

3035
02:50:22,034 --> 02:50:24,924
Yeah.

3036
02:50:22,034 --> 02:50:24,924
Yeah.

3037
02:50:24,925 --> 02:50:31,721
Yes. Thank you.

3038
02:50:34,931 --> 02:50:37,378
I know we saw the paper, right, and we wanted to be like a

3039
02:50:37,388 --> 02:50:39,809
pretty late squirrel, and we wanted to make it fit.

3040
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:42,304
I had a big deal with you guys at Harvitch. Yeah.

3041
02:50:42,305 --> 02:50:46,898
Thank you. you You know, if I probably submitted it,

3042
02:50:46,899 --> 02:50:51,545
yeah, it would do that. Okay. And

3043
02:50:51,546 --> 02:50:55,166
then we'll just change the length down there.

3044
02:50:55,335 --> 02:50:58,631
Yeah, I'll get that in the size of the length. Let me set that

3045
02:50:58,632 --> 02:50:59,116
in 5. Bye.

3046
02:51:05,186 --> 02:51:09,922
And there's the head. And there's the head. You Oh.

3047
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:14,647
It's over. Get back,

3048
02:51:14,648 --> 02:51:17,505
get ready. you And hit, I had a weirdo hit in it like a

3049
02:51:17,506 --> 02:51:20,474
formula. Geez, there we go. Hit,

3050
02:51:20,475 --> 02:51:22,760
I had a weirdo. Okay.

3051
02:51:22,761 --> 02:51:24,729
And to do So to do I we're ready. Okay. I'll do that all

3052
02:51:24,730 --> 02:51:27,608
the time. See if they get this. You know what I mean,

3053
02:51:27,609 --> 02:51:29,703
they don't look like it.

3054
02:51:29,704 --> 02:51:31,719
I guess I'll do it. Yes, I'll do it. Let's do this. No, I'm

3055
02:51:31,720 --> 02:51:33,846
going to keep one because I don't have a gun, Russ.

3056
02:51:33,847 --> 02:51:37,007
Okay. I'm going to pass this gun on.

3057
02:51:37,008 --> 02:51:39,080
Umm. Alright, and I'll see a second.

3058
02:51:37,994 --> 02:51:42,657
Bye. That's been shot on my phone.

3059
02:51:42,703 --> 02:51:45,207
Yeah, that is not all of the labor codes,

3060
02:51:45,208 --> 02:51:47,351
but that, that is what you would get.

3061
02:51:55,391 --> 02:52:00,045
you can see here all the ones in the bed.

3062
02:52:00,429 --> 02:52:02,695
So, yeah,

3063
02:52:02,696 --> 02:52:05,617
16, you know, and so on and so forth.

3064
02:52:05,618 --> 02:52:10,148
But I, even the family, I use on so many different projects.

3065
02:52:10,618 --> 02:52:12,612
It's good, I'm both. All right. I was having the base bit on my

3066
02:52:12,613 --> 02:52:16,600
hand, so. Okay.

3067
02:52:16,601 --> 02:52:18,679
May it doesn't give you a decent look.

3068
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:21,142
We'll see you in the look at him. No,

3069
02:52:21,143 --> 02:52:23,771
I just need to remove the description.

3070
02:52:23,772 --> 02:52:26,259
That's not really the description. But,

3071
02:52:26,476 --> 02:52:29,267
I mean, I guess the reason. reason. I don't know.

3072
02:52:29,268 --> 02:52:31,377
How would I do that?

3073
02:52:31,903 --> 02:52:35,463
It isn't, doesn't, does not have a fellow well amount of money to do.

3074
02:52:35,464 --> 02:52:37,622
You know here, Justin?

3075
02:52:37,623 --> 02:52:39,739
Yep. You've shown it on the list, it's both something. I get that,

3076
02:52:40,058 --> 02:52:42,111
you've got it on the list. It's on, I get it. On the link

3077
02:52:42,112 --> 02:52:44,806
here, on the cover. Don't forget to subscribe here's that.

3078
02:52:46,187 --> 02:52:48,954
That's both things, so you're right, you would need four.

3079
02:52:49,087 --> 02:52:51,671
You need two on this end, two on this end. Thank you.

3080
02:52:51,672 --> 02:52:55,605
Cause I would assume this would be quite- And then the end goes up

3081
02:52:55,606 --> 02:52:58,199
and it's- I doubt it's enough.

3082
02:52:58,930 --> 02:53:04,061
You'd assume the- Yeah, probably unless there's a program

3083
02:53:04,157 --> 02:53:07,720
written on this to start with anybody in the- .

3084
02:53:07,751 --> 02:53:11,103
I think I was doing work. He's been into the program.

3085
02:53:11,542 --> 02:53:13,588
So, when there's a pump taking,

3086
02:53:14,730 --> 02:53:18,166
first back to five. Bye. Now, whatever, this over went.

3087
02:53:19,333 --> 02:53:22,316
When does this get over written? Umm,

3088
02:53:22,327 --> 02:53:26,335
when we do it here, . . . Yeah, this would .

3089
02:53:26,336 --> 02:53:29,610
. . of this said, not stuck as April before we get over it,

3090
02:53:29,611 --> 02:53:32,297
whether or not they . . . . it's just the That's where we

3091
02:53:32,298 --> 02:53:34,802
have our first energies to help them scratch.

3092
02:53:34,857 --> 02:53:37,917
It's just the scale of the workings in the background,

3093
02:53:37,918 --> 02:53:41,230
right? The . . . the program self about the data,

3094
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:43,426
so . . we're dealing with the data,

3095
02:53:45,277 --> 02:53:48,413
so . . . um . . . so then Oh,

3096
02:53:49,332 --> 02:53:53,386
slug with lips, well, both ends you needed for four clips there.

3097
02:53:56,051 --> 02:53:58,908
Yeah, and in a piece we're gonna have,

3098
02:53:59,559 --> 02:54:01,969
well, two clips is right there. That's right.

3099
02:54:01,970 --> 02:54:05,337
Um. you Yeah,

3100
02:54:05,338 --> 02:54:08,097
that's correct. Uh,

3101
02:54:08,108 --> 02:54:10,164
key. What is key?

3102
02:54:10,165 --> 02:54:13,031
Well, the moment both ends. Uh.

3103
02:54:13,032 --> 02:54:15,394
Alright, uh, good luck, moment.

3104
02:54:16,346 --> 02:54:18,683
Little souls. Hey,

3105
02:54:18,684 --> 02:54:22,557
if there's nothing I'd be here. You I don't know if that's there,

3106
02:54:22,558 --> 02:54:25,143
isn't it? He doubles the way of it,

3107
02:54:25,144 --> 02:54:28,619
also the 10.5 inch should probably be more,

3108
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:30,814
You change to work for time,

3109
02:54:30,815 --> 02:54:34,746
I, I, I, I, I'm, I, I'm,

3110
02:54:36,078 --> 02:54:38,992
I'm, Yeah, almost the way I be. . Proximatins,

3111
02:54:39,069 --> 02:54:41,291
Exlisten, Wellwood, Muffin,

3112
02:54:41,292 --> 02:54:44,564
Poke, Encevilt, Wellwood, Corners,

3113
02:54:44,565 --> 02:54:46,734
That's Pruners, Standard. You Okay,

3114
02:54:46,735 --> 02:54:47,300
so. Hello.

3115
02:54:54,071 --> 02:54:56,767
Oh, this is with,

3116
02:54:56,768 --> 02:54:59,933
uh, with, this is with the additional clips on the flanges.

3117
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:03,016
So here, um. I hope.

3118
02:55:03,017 --> 02:55:05,788
You're filling well there around the render center clip,

3119
02:55:05,789 --> 02:55:08,358
and you should be four, cause you've got four clips.

3120
02:55:10,716 --> 02:55:15,785
And then that- I've got there two times bottom up

3121
02:55:15,786 --> 02:55:18,243
and bottom up if feeling well.

3122
02:55:18,244 --> 02:55:24,238
world. Okay,

3123
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:28,096
so, just a little bit of way to start.

3124
02:55:28,097 --> 02:55:30,553
And, plus, I mean, this tea,

3125
02:55:30,554 --> 02:55:37,029
just a clip, well, there is tea. See you. Okay,

3126
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:39,210
so the tea is, yeah,

3127
02:55:39,211 --> 02:55:42,254
so you see, you've got the plants on the bottom of the bottle,

3128
02:55:42,255 --> 02:55:44,419
and, yeah, we're gonna get full.

3129
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:48,321
2 Umm, so I don't like the description well at the moment about the

3130
02:55:48,322 --> 02:55:52,116
ills. Yeah, I really really was talking about normal.

3131
02:55:52,141 --> 02:55:52,576
Yeah.

3132
02:55:57,289 --> 02:55:59,352
Yeah, you're, you're just talking about when Cliff saw them. Yeah. Yeah.

3133
02:55:59,353 --> 02:56:03,874
It was, and, and, and. Yeah. And then not added to this on the

3134
02:56:03,875 --> 02:56:06,260
flange as well. So,

3135
02:56:06,776 --> 02:56:09,462
that umm. What I,

3136
02:56:09,951 --> 02:56:12,585
what I think of on this particular bond right here,

3137
02:56:12,586 --> 02:56:14,995
umm, it's got two fillers.

3138
02:56:14,996 --> 02:56:19,788
Go ahead. Go ahead. I don't know what side of the angle you're gonna

3139
02:56:19,789 --> 02:56:24,731
have on the top of that. I hope you video.

3140
02:56:24,732 --> 02:56:26,775
I don't know how long it's gonna be,

3141
02:56:27,112 --> 02:56:29,622
but 10 and a half inches is probably,

3142
02:56:29,650 --> 02:56:32,776
it may not be enough. If you've got a pretty wide fringe.

3143
02:56:32,777 --> 02:56:35,308
The, uh,

3144
02:56:35,319 --> 02:56:37,782
I, I was. That Tira hands just,

3145
02:56:37,783 --> 02:56:40,452
to me, maybe little bit too brittle.

3146
02:56:40,572 --> 02:56:42,971
We. You can change the formula like that. You're my,

3147
02:56:43,033 --> 02:56:46,255
I'm willing to follow them. In my, in my involvement,

3148
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:48,579
I'm saying, take the width of the flange. I'd like if they can they

3149
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:53,049
should. I don't want them either,

3150
02:56:53,050 --> 02:56:55,179
right? But I don't look how much. Once I think of a pass, I'm

3151
02:56:55,180 --> 02:56:59,775
looking for some three. for real. I sure 4 inch length and

3152
02:56:59,776 --> 02:57:01,992
up low. I just want to apologize to the 4 inch shear size. And

3153
02:57:02,122 --> 02:57:04,856
with what I just want to do, plus a miniature.

3154
02:57:04,857 --> 02:57:09,329
You just to get both sides of the angle and Bitbucket helps for her.

3155
02:57:09,330 --> 02:57:11,670
So, uhm, he was,

3156
02:57:11,671 --> 02:57:16,234
uh, splitting the haters. . . Yeah. So, we need to change that here.

3157
02:57:16,767 --> 02:57:22,144
Yep. Bye Never formal.

3158
02:57:22,145 --> 02:57:22,360
Mm-hmm.

3159
02:57:29,051 --> 02:57:32,941
Don't even get the people bought that,

3160
02:57:32,942 --> 02:57:36,726
but if you didn't use somebody like you, you wouldn't know all this.

3161
02:57:36,862 --> 02:57:39,095
Oh. All the best. This is 100% right.

3162
02:57:39,096 --> 02:57:41,274
And that's what people have done. I'm like, ah,

3163
02:57:41,913 --> 02:57:44,140
I'm tripped and following this group up.

3164
02:57:44,141 --> 02:57:46,288
And I, I, I, okay. And so I figured all that out.

3165
02:57:46,289 --> 02:57:49,433
Let me help get right there at least. So it's very bottom.

3166
02:57:49,434 --> 02:57:53,523
I'm just the one that says two times, no, no. Two. You top the

3167
02:57:53,524 --> 02:57:58,060
bottom of it there again. And

3168
02:57:58,061 --> 02:58:01,211
actually the bottom is going to be correct. It's correct.

3169
02:58:01,212 --> 02:58:03,828
Cause it's got two, and we'll say it's not two,

3170
02:58:03,829 --> 02:58:09,251
eight, and so. Which is unusual for all the other ones.

3171
02:58:09,252 --> 02:58:12,759
So,

3172
02:58:12,760 --> 02:58:19,970
um, where are we? Good. Yeah,

3173
02:58:19,971 --> 02:58:22,229
it's like, we're playing back in there.

3174
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:25,140
Really, we got an explainer with, um,

3175
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:29,387
Times Two. You didn't. Because we're going to have this side,

3176
02:58:29,388 --> 02:58:31,868
this side, if we're going to, and then we're going to,

3177
02:58:31,967 --> 02:58:34,091
and then we're going to add in the achievers and something like that.

3178
02:58:34,092 --> 02:58:39,176
So T is a clip, only

3179
02:58:39,477 --> 02:58:42,131
connection is. Yes.

3180
02:58:42,132 --> 02:58:44,570
Yeah, Top Office, Pembroke,

3181
02:58:44,571 --> 02:58:47,207
Signal, Goonie, Red. Oh,

3182
02:58:47,208 --> 02:58:50,111
and you're reading the Angie Mark? Umm.

3183
02:58:50,112 --> 02:58:52,837
I'm always used to the own connection with the Father.

3184
02:58:53,388 --> 02:58:55,950
Yeah. You're right. Most of the time.

3185
02:58:56,139 --> 02:58:58,151
Okay. I think I'm using it right now. Bye.

3186
02:58:58,152 --> 02:59:00,260
I don't know if it's actual frame of being inside.

3187
02:59:00,261 --> 02:59:02,586
I don't know if it's able to use speed. Yeah.

3188
02:59:02,675 --> 02:59:05,218
Okay. It doesn't like product at all. Somebody just say it.

3189
02:59:05,328 --> 02:59:08,618
You know what? You better. I don't know. It should be well done.

3190
02:59:08,619 --> 02:59:11,884
But I'm not still in my room. So the relation would be yes.

3191
02:59:11,885 --> 02:59:14,639
Uh. That's cool.

3192
02:59:16,557 --> 02:59:20,131
But what's funny is that Atlas S4 player doesn't belong to Liberty Nation.

3193
02:59:20,225 --> 02:59:24,859
But here's the one. Yeah. Yeah. You Sighs

3194
02:59:24,860 --> 02:59:28,457
with badminton's regarding Justin, and they don't just want to be next to him.

3195
02:59:28,801 --> 02:59:31,151
He only is there a big one. Listen. It was.

3196
02:59:31,152 --> 02:59:35,966
But, uh, since I wanted to get a new 7-2-7 years

3197
02:59:35,967 --> 02:59:39,020
cap move, I don't know. Yeah. Work way. it's okay.

3198
02:59:39,021 --> 02:59:41,562
So see. and all that kind of shit. So they're going to have a

3199
02:59:41,563 --> 02:59:45,928
certain ones and smaller connections. You can still have a lot of other things.

3200
02:59:45,929 --> 02:59:50,801
If he didn't want it, he'd sit and- . . MORE THING, COME GONNA,

3201
02:59:51,009 --> 02:59:55,151
THEY ARE WELKITTING,

3202
02:59:55,152 --> 02:59:57,316
THEY REFER TO OUT OF THE SMIRCH, CHANGFALL,

3203
02:59:57,581 --> 03:00:01,496
WITH THE ENDINERS. THOSE THE ONES RELAY TO UNS WEIRD,

3204
03:00:01,601 --> 03:00:04,730
MISTAN, THEY'RE SLAYS IN THE HAD. Yeah,

3205
03:00:04,731 --> 03:00:07,058
I'm not sure what's going on there, so, uh,

3206
03:00:07,069 --> 03:00:10,058
I don't know that I already buy all that country less.

3207
03:00:10,568 --> 03:00:12,993
Yep. Bye. Yeah, it's a custom one,

3208
03:00:12,994 --> 03:00:16,305
so, okay. Umm. Umm. It's in a space.

3209
03:00:16,467 --> 03:00:18,570
Is that not in here? You will change,

3210
03:00:18,571 --> 03:00:22,087
though. Thank Uhm, Basepoint, so when you- when you do a column,

3211
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:24,514
you're gonna put an H on it if it's Basepoint,

3212
03:00:24,515 --> 03:00:29,311
Cappoint, and so it puts the wheel- putting all the column because

3213
03:00:29,312 --> 03:00:33,324
it is- it is the exact perimeter of the column.

3214
03:00:33,907 --> 03:00:36,023
So it doesn't technically have any- which is put on it.

3215
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:38,518
So then we're- so we don't need to put it.

3216
03:00:39,031 --> 03:00:42,342
We'll be on a base plane. This should be an A,

3217
03:00:42,343 --> 03:00:44,483
which is just- Yes. Conne, Ehm.

3218
03:00:46,253 --> 03:00:49,385
Alright. This is why we have the Type H admin's order,

3219
03:00:49,386 --> 03:00:53,007
3D8, and so much in here. Right up there is the idea that we

3220
03:00:53,008 --> 03:00:57,147
have to an honor. Let's pay for it.

3221
03:00:57,423 --> 03:00:59,778
All of these are traditional. It can be All of this,

3222
03:00:59,779 --> 03:01:02,903
uh, option is to pick from where it happened well.

3223
03:01:02,904 --> 03:01:05,483
All of these cheese be made to the world yesterday.

3224
03:01:05,611 --> 03:01:09,166
Those are all going to be affecting our- right, because we changed the time

3225
03:01:09,167 --> 03:01:11,388
in the world, right? Yeah. Yeah, so everything,

3226
03:01:11,472 --> 03:01:16,545
yeah, we did yesterday, but I saw us. Okay. So U

3227
03:01:16,556 --> 03:01:21,807
on Beings is your change that formula

3228
03:01:21,808 --> 03:01:25,657
right there. That's the second one. I love that. There we go.

3229
03:01:25,658 --> 03:01:27,731
Yeah, and the only one,

3230
03:01:27,732 --> 03:01:31,480
actually. Yeah,

3231
03:01:31,481 --> 03:01:34,091
so this is right. I'm going to add a bit of the wrong quantity

3232
03:01:34,092 --> 03:01:36,749
on one of those as well. Uhm,

3233
03:01:36,759 --> 03:01:39,950
the V code, which is well and ehm.

3234
03:01:39,951 --> 03:01:43,487
See ya. and Plates both ears, which is just shoot tabs on both ears.

3235
03:01:43,488 --> 03:01:46,456
I think that description is shoot tabs on both ears.

3236
03:01:47,198 --> 03:01:51,795
So, uhh. Umm, there should be welding along the length of the standard clip,

3237
03:01:51,796 --> 03:01:53,927
not the width. Umm,

3238
03:01:53,938 --> 03:01:56,231
you see the, so basically,

3239
03:01:56,232 --> 03:02:00,982
if we had a 4 inch by 6 inch shear tab,

3240
03:02:01,292 --> 03:02:03,428
it's putting the welding on the 4 inch side. So,

3241
03:02:03,429 --> 03:02:07,711
thanks. So, we need to change that to the length of the standard.

3242
03:02:07,712 --> 03:02:16,845
Yeah. Yeah. 100

3243
03:02:16,846 --> 03:02:20,231
bucks, I'll put $100,000 on it,

3244
03:02:20,232 --> 03:02:23,850
got you sh- avocators. I haven't looked at these tonight.

3245
03:02:25,323 --> 03:02:29,231
They don't know that they're puttin' the wrong stuff on to.

3246
03:02:29,232 --> 03:02:34,548
. . . Just wait. Color Ranmin'. It'scomeTerc

3247
03:02:34,549 --> 03:02:37,238
Constance Scentechros grew up. Brilliant in Scentech homes.ufficient.

3248
03:02:37,239 --> 03:02:40,890
. . As I said, here's the changes you need to make on your

3249
03:02:40,891 --> 03:02:44,275
false setup. But there have been many people.

3250
03:02:44,276 --> 03:02:47,718
I don't know if I've got it. If you're doing the same thing over

3251
03:02:47,719 --> 03:02:50,240
and over and over it's there, it's not happening.

3252
03:02:50,779 --> 03:02:54,478
You've gotta fit around the line. You've got Yeah,

3253
03:02:54,479 --> 03:02:57,264
they're going through putting the guns on.

3254
03:02:57,265 --> 03:02:59,694
Trust them about it, that's right.

3255
03:02:59,695 --> 03:03:02,171
You're never looking to see if it is the exact amount.

3256
03:03:02,172 --> 03:03:04,645
They're doing whale door if it's, they can just,

3257
03:03:05,028 --> 03:03:10,679
it does cat-a-doo tubes to base plants. Um. See

3258
03:03:10,680 --> 03:03:12,784
if it's a column, it's a different, it's a different column.

3259
03:03:12,785 --> 03:03:15,057
Yeah, yeah. I don't think the column,

3260
03:03:15,058 --> 03:03:17,120
2 column goes through to base plant.

3261
03:03:17,121 --> 03:03:20,174
I'm not. Okay. Bye. Hahaha. It's automatic plate set up to a lot of

3262
03:03:20,175 --> 03:03:23,783
my style, isn't it? So, uh, we need to show them that you're going

3263
03:03:23,784 --> 03:03:26,231
to attach the tube to the top of the face. Yes.

3264
03:03:26,232 --> 03:03:28,397
. . All the way around you probably would soon be out there.

3265
03:03:28,422 --> 03:03:31,285
I'm putting it on a bus and I've been putting it on a bus

3266
03:03:31,458 --> 03:03:34,983
and I'm still more responsible than that. I'm still- trying to see what you're

3267
03:03:34,984 --> 03:03:39,737
talking about. It goes all over. That almost never happens to life.

3268
03:03:40,958 --> 03:03:44,030
Have you seen I think one of these light bulbs that are here.

3269
03:03:44,031 --> 03:03:46,677
Oh yeah. Have that. I don't understand.

3270
03:03:47,322 --> 03:03:49,772
Yes, you can be okay for that. You did.

3271
03:03:49,773 --> 03:03:54,370
Bye. Bye bye. I think that's cool. I think I

3272
03:03:54,371 --> 03:03:56,687
have, I have, I really, I just, I think I should have measured mass

3273
03:03:56,688 --> 03:03:59,644
and we will. Pagging all that,

3274
03:04:00,222 --> 03:04:02,428
want to serve. Yeah,

3275
03:04:02,429 --> 03:04:05,542
I think it's just very, very easy to have in this shit anyway.

3276
03:04:05,543 --> 03:04:08,232
Otherwise, we'll be, I'm sure it was the take-on, right by,

3277
03:04:08,233 --> 03:04:12,961
uhm, the big man. Problem-like, so, there are just several uses of them.

3278
03:04:13,114 --> 03:04:17,660
To me, they know what we- I'm not really using the assembly philosophy.

3279
03:04:17,668 --> 03:04:22,240
That should be poor as well, because you're- please leave a

3280
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:24,327
because you're doing, umm,

3281
03:04:24,338 --> 03:04:29,084
cut off both sides of the flip on both ends.

3282
03:04:29,085 --> 03:04:33,042
So, yeah. you W's gonna be the same way,

3283
03:04:33,043 --> 03:04:36,701
just on one end. Have one. It's fine, I'm getting it.

3284
03:04:37,374 --> 03:04:41,936
Okay. I just...he said,he went

3285
03:04:41,937 --> 03:04:45,570
the last time I had a new mission. I'm gonna go and Bye-bye.

3286
03:04:46,271 --> 03:04:48,590
Yeah.

3287
03:04:48,629 --> 03:04:52,493
Oh, and this,we got some astrophics here too.

3288
03:04:52,494 --> 03:04:56,401
Umm. Oh. Back on me,

3289
03:04:56,504 --> 03:04:58,500
what we can do here, don't do that. Lead, alright, so this shoot has

3290
03:04:58,501 --> 03:05:01,591
both the- If want to videos,

3291
03:05:01,592 --> 03:05:04,714
please I'm you'll love things. Notice there's no umm,

3292
03:05:04,715 --> 03:05:07,857
umm. Okay, so that one has holes,

3293
03:05:07,858 --> 03:05:09,999
the vault at the box doesn't believe it or not.

3294
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:13,222
Go. I don't recall the standard. Yeah,

3295
03:05:13,223 --> 03:05:15,722
okay. So, then,

3296
03:05:16,091 --> 03:05:20,842
you don't know if there's no, um. Bye There is no few

3297
03:05:20,843 --> 03:05:24,281
moths here. So,

3298
03:05:24,282 --> 03:05:26,291
if you uncheck, show them the included.

3299
03:05:26,292 --> 03:05:29,423
. . And then,

3300
03:05:29,424 --> 03:05:32,268
there shouldn't be a look over here for field balls.

3301
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:39,084
Right there.

3302
03:05:39,085 --> 03:05:41,194
. She need two .

3303
03:05:41,195 --> 03:05:43,511
. . for both ends.

3304
03:05:43,512 --> 03:05:46,374
You can do same on W for one of them.

3305
03:05:46,375 --> 03:05:46,464
And

3306
03:05:59,591 --> 03:06:05,423
That's fixed. Umm.

3307
03:06:05,434 --> 03:06:07,631
Late we fixed the burden. part of me.

3308
03:06:07,632 --> 03:06:11,384
Umm.

3309
03:06:11,405 --> 03:06:15,564
Playing in D. So.

3310
03:06:15,565 --> 03:06:18,194
Uh, This is, if you're doin' an ain't.

3311
03:06:18,426 --> 03:06:22,063
I've used this for, It's rare,

3312
03:06:22,064 --> 03:06:24,804
but I've used it for output clips, so I- I love the ins like

3313
03:06:24,805 --> 03:06:28,079
if it's a, or really clips on one end,

3314
03:06:28,288 --> 03:06:31,491
so where something will be gonna come, but then it's got clips.

3315
03:06:31,492 --> 03:06:35,428
Thanks. I don't mean for something like that.

3316
03:06:37,371 --> 03:06:42,003
So, this right here is- you got the whaling it once again is screwed

3317
03:06:42,004 --> 03:06:45,326
up. It's got the whaling of two clips instead of four clips.

3318
03:06:47,392 --> 03:06:50,852
Same thing. Same with e, which is one,

3319
03:06:51,122 --> 03:06:54,772
one side, so you need two wheels there again.

3320
03:06:54,773 --> 03:07:00,722
Good. Cave, uhh,

3321
03:07:00,744 --> 03:07:03,207
this is full head of prep,

3322
03:07:03,208 --> 03:07:05,921
so the one. When we were looking at we had a double level on

3323
03:07:05,922 --> 03:07:07,973
the plate, in the wheel,

3324
03:07:07,974 --> 03:07:10,207
uhm, this does.

3325
03:07:10,208 --> 03:07:13,539
Veterans. Uhm,

3326
03:07:13,550 --> 03:07:16,498
it does a prep on one end.

3327
03:07:16,499 --> 03:07:18,679
You see the burn there? It's just on one end.

3328
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:22,327
Yeah. Thank you. So you need to bump that up to two.

3329
03:07:24,564 --> 03:07:29,182
And then go to the M. We'll in the code for

3330
03:07:29,183 --> 03:07:31,662
pin weld two ends.

3331
03:07:32,567 --> 03:07:37,297
And for full pin grip weld two is only- I had one ending too

3332
03:07:37,298 --> 03:07:39,408
for the prep here as well. Uhm, uhh,

3333
03:07:39,409 --> 03:07:44,111
uhh, that's sh-

3334
03:07:44,112 --> 03:07:48,896
shouldn't be a- that burn there should be two.

3335
03:07:49,391 --> 03:07:52,151
So it's got- it's going- umm.

3336
03:07:52,152 --> 03:07:54,331
Two Vians of the,

3337
03:07:54,609 --> 03:07:56,922
so you have 20, it's got to be on this side,

3338
03:07:56,923 --> 03:08:01,396
on this side, so you really need two. you Yeah.

3339
03:08:01,397 --> 03:08:04,552
Uhm,

3340
03:08:04,563 --> 03:08:08,129
T, which is three plates.

3341
03:08:08,130 --> 03:08:14,202
Bye bye. So this is, umm,

3342
03:08:14,213 --> 03:08:16,063
so this is a pilot. I love

3343
03:08:21,656 --> 03:08:23,618
So, that connection, my vision, will harm to the plate. So, the umm. All

3344
03:08:23,619 --> 03:08:26,768
right. All right. You gotta have four burns active with.

3345
03:08:27,608 --> 03:08:29,624
So, uh, burn there.

3346
03:08:29,625 --> 03:08:32,411
Yeah. There we go. Could be cause. Thanks for watching.

3347
03:08:32,412 --> 03:08:35,660
It's got a burn on this side and back down the other side of

3348
03:08:35,661 --> 03:08:37,905
here. Yes, I'm down the other side, right?

3349
03:08:38,391 --> 03:08:41,478
And then, You On U,

3350
03:08:41,489 --> 03:08:44,489
it's gonna be the same thing except for just,

3351
03:08:44,503 --> 03:08:48,436
you need two burnings. Yep. Go.

3352
03:08:48,437 --> 03:08:52,579
Alright, so V is,

3353
03:08:52,580 --> 03:08:56,028
umm, I don't know how anybody uses this.

3354
03:08:56,029 --> 03:08:58,097
Let's do it. Thank you. But if you look at the guy, I'm reading

3355
03:08:58,098 --> 03:09:01,477
a little bit on the newsletter.

3356
03:09:01,478 --> 03:09:03,514
Okay, so, uhm, well, this is for once,

3357
03:09:03,515 --> 03:09:05,673
yeah. I was thinking of- Yeah,

3358
03:09:05,674 --> 03:09:08,147
for plates, yeah, you can use this all the time, forget it,

3359
03:09:08,148 --> 03:09:11,538
right? So, it includes welding on short leg,

3360
03:09:11,539 --> 03:09:13,873
good way. Bye Which does not apply.

3361
03:09:13,874 --> 03:09:16,611
That's an angle, right? So, get rid of that.

3362
03:09:16,978 --> 03:09:19,575
So, let's make sure we don't blow anything.

3363
03:09:20,017 --> 03:09:23,342
Thank you. Yeah, that should be good.

3364
03:09:23,343 --> 03:09:28,631
Rods. Thank you very much.

3365
03:09:28,632 --> 03:09:30,891
Uhh,

3366
03:09:30,902 --> 03:09:34,229
good to K. Once again,

3367
03:09:34,230 --> 03:09:37,769
a powerful, very beautiful pin, prepped on- I'm too into a rod,

3368
03:09:37,770 --> 03:09:41,576
you know. Uhm,

3369
03:09:41,586 --> 03:09:44,359
but this, this wouldn't give you any,

3370
03:09:44,360 --> 03:09:47,760
like- Thank you. For burning because it said wall thickness,

3371
03:09:47,761 --> 03:09:50,394
there's no wall thickness for a rod. So,

3372
03:09:50,576 --> 03:09:52,751
yeah. I mean, I- We'll see you next time.

3373
03:09:52,752 --> 03:09:54,942
I don't know if you wanna fix it. You have to create the formula.

3374
03:09:54,943 --> 03:09:58,205
You're never gonna use this, right? I don't wanna seem to delete it,

3375
03:09:58,206 --> 03:10:00,796
you know? Yeah. Else the same way.

3376
03:10:00,797 --> 03:10:03,286
is just one end. So,

3377
03:10:03,287 --> 03:10:07,285
um,

3378
03:10:07,295 --> 03:10:09,481
and ehm and ehm are the same way. Bye Well,

3379
03:10:09,482 --> 03:10:11,593
pimp, prep, and well, that's the same way.

3380
03:10:11,594 --> 03:10:14,738
But, if you're never known as Uso, that's like, how often is that gonna

3381
03:10:14,739 --> 03:10:17,351
happen, alright? Alright, two, it's good in two.

3382
03:10:20,606 --> 03:10:25,331
Yeah.

3383
03:10:20,606 --> 03:10:25,331
Yeah.

3384
03:10:25,332 --> 03:10:28,092
in the tombs and D. Well,

3385
03:10:28,093 --> 03:10:31,158
it's both ears, has welling for one third party jam.

3386
03:10:31,159 --> 03:10:33,371
So, yeah. So.

3387
03:10:33,372 --> 03:10:36,402
Very good. And then e,

3388
03:10:36,403 --> 03:10:38,607
it's gonna be the same. We'll just take two.

3389
03:10:38,608 --> 03:10:41,351
Here's a tee. See you.

3390
03:10:41,352 --> 03:10:43,780
Alright,

3391
03:10:43,781 --> 03:10:46,335
Devil's Doing Well-Ding, so this is Flatterbank.

3392
03:10:46,336 --> 03:10:51,005
And I'll see I'll see you in Devil's Doing Well-Ding,

3393
03:10:51,006 --> 03:10:53,614
also Tinnish, for even more. Oh,

3394
03:10:53,621 --> 03:10:56,640
this is the same thing as that other one. Umm. All right.

3395
03:10:56,641 --> 03:11:00,183
Okay, having me. I you're here. Thank you. It does double the welding here,

3396
03:11:00,184 --> 03:11:04,157
so as well a moment both ends, you need to change that forward and

3397
03:11:04,158 --> 03:11:08,566
tune on that one. So,

3398
03:11:08,567 --> 03:11:11,313
I'm not on the weld and say I'll take a look.

3399
03:11:11,314 --> 03:11:15,251
Yeah. And,

3400
03:11:18,042 --> 03:11:21,144
Yeah, and then,

3401
03:11:21,145 --> 03:11:22,823
yeah, the splits are a little bit bigger. Well, yeah, the question is whether

3402
03:11:22,824 --> 03:11:25,771
the- Thank In the half it's enough or not again.

3403
03:11:25,991 --> 03:11:29,115
Yeah. Um,

3404
03:11:29,125 --> 03:11:31,300
but we can't use that and look at- .

3405
03:11:31,336 --> 03:11:33,431
and China 2. Compass,

3406
03:11:33,432 --> 03:11:35,921
we have the same, like, you know,

3407
03:11:35,922 --> 03:11:38,731
the width of the 2, we're shopping like that,

3408
03:11:38,732 --> 03:11:41,375
certainly. Please the width, um,

3409
03:11:41,386 --> 03:11:43,460
in order to make that happen. you

3410
03:11:55,391 --> 03:12:00,391
I

3411
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:03,293
think there's like too bad on that.

3412
03:12:03,612 --> 03:12:07,115
Get out of it. It'll be down there to something.

3413
03:12:08,517 --> 03:12:12,376
Two deaths and two wits, yeah. Yeah.

3414
03:12:12,377 --> 03:12:36,495
Always. Yes. Mmm,

3415
03:12:36,496 --> 03:12:38,718
this is good. You can speak if you thought about it.

3416
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:40,882
I don't know if this is the last one. Okay.

3417
03:12:43,111 --> 03:12:51,030
Okay. Well,

3418
03:12:51,036 --> 03:12:53,651
I'll take that back and leave you down there so we'll get a wha-

3419
03:12:53,652 --> 03:12:57,820
That's the one. It's the same deal with So,

3420
03:13:01,691 --> 03:13:03,818
Bump,

3421
03:13:03,819 --> 03:13:06,290
XC, Bump,

3422
03:13:06,336 --> 03:13:09,731
XC, Bump, XC Perfect.

3423
03:13:09,732 --> 03:13:12,521
Fire.

3424
03:13:13,498 --> 03:13:22,884
Facts have labor goods, you make. Thank No,

3425
03:13:22,885 --> 03:13:25,811
no, no! Ooh.

3426
03:13:25,812 --> 03:13:29,463
And you, I've been forgetting this, but if you weren't creating all this stuff,

3427
03:13:29,580 --> 03:13:31,969
or, you know, actually, yeah,

3428
03:13:31,979 --> 03:13:35,466
you'd obviously be pretty sure if you were. Welling times overshot,

3429
03:13:35,467 --> 03:13:37,773
I've said when you can be a new one,

3430
03:13:37,936 --> 03:13:40,456
it's that all you welling feels are against,

3431
03:13:40,457 --> 03:13:43,501
instead of with the feel. I- I probably will because,

3432
03:13:43,502 --> 03:13:46,710
uhm,

3433
03:13:46,721 --> 03:13:49,051
I would want to make it with the information at any very,

3434
03:13:49,052 --> 03:13:54,348
very soon. . . The challenge of it is that when you're

3435
03:13:54,349 --> 03:13:58,421
in the- SNA,

3436
03:13:58,587 --> 03:14:01,076
and you look at the top of your house, you would show,

3437
03:14:01,487 --> 03:14:03,723
they would include for a few inch hour.

3438
03:14:03,724 --> 03:14:06,838
We'll see you in the next But,

3439
03:14:07,572 --> 03:14:11,534
the pockets are created, the labor groups will be reworded as it,

3440
03:14:11,535 --> 03:14:13,629
and we can create some.

3441
03:14:13,630 --> 03:14:15,938
Love. and so then you can be able to win,

3442
03:14:16,087 --> 03:14:19,526
yeah. You really should have been bad on that straight thing right here.

3443
03:14:19,527 --> 03:14:22,091
It's good to be in my instrument and I actually don't like it.

3444
03:14:22,092 --> 03:14:25,805
You have the reports, you have to send it off next year.

3445
03:14:26,118 --> 03:14:29,038
It's good to be in person because I really got bad on that and

3446
03:14:29,039 --> 03:14:31,874
I can't get that. Thank you. They're not going to go.

3447
03:14:31,875 --> 03:14:35,398
They will set down this morning. That's my big span and they're,

3448
03:14:35,399 --> 03:14:37,925
they're just putting people in change their heart.

3449
03:14:37,926 --> 03:14:42,281
All right. We're going to do them to get everything from all of you.

3450
03:14:42,282 --> 03:14:45,571
So, do you think you're going to have the direction? I wish you a

3451
03:14:45,572 --> 03:14:47,842
good night. Goin' and think about it.

3452
03:14:47,843 --> 03:14:49,997
I don't mean to think about who he has since, like,

3453
03:14:50,443 --> 03:14:52,840
yeah. I'm not really sure if it's a very complicated part of it. We'll

3454
03:14:52,841 --> 03:14:56,741
in the next that. We've got to know about where they want to go

3455
03:14:56,742 --> 03:14:59,550
and study all night. We've got to see this all day.

3456
03:14:59,551 --> 03:15:01,219
We've got to do it. We've got to know what it is. We've got

I've been, everybody was on the side.

3605
03:23:30,726 --> 03:23:35,349
They never gave a- You actually- Yes,

3606
03:23:36,305 --> 03:23:43,066
that's- It's

3607
03:23:43,067 --> 03:23:45,902
a dumbest industry.

3608
03:23:45,926 --> 03:23:48,680
You gotta harken it. It creates 3D.

3609
03:23:48,745 --> 03:23:52,088
You have to put it in the 2D to get somebody else to make

3610
03:23:52,089 --> 03:23:55,762
it in the 3D to get it. You really need a 2D.

3611
03:23:55,763 --> 03:23:58,072
It's like this one. in morning. I've done a cycle.

3612
03:23:59,348 --> 03:24:02,730
I don't understand how to put that shit. I mean,

3613
03:24:02,731 --> 03:24:04,991
you get these thousand drawings full back.

3614
03:24:04,992 --> 03:24:07,481
I don't know about that shit.

3615
03:24:07,482 --> 03:24:09,826
You might as well give me the date.

3616
03:24:09,827 --> 03:24:15,781
You know what I mean? And I

3617
03:24:15,782 --> 03:24:18,611
know we can't give you that. So I prepared a new possibility for you

3618
03:24:18,791 --> 03:24:20,806
to do some type of stuff. Okay, good bye.

3619
03:24:20,807 --> 03:24:25,563
Happy. Now

3620
03:24:25,582 --> 03:24:27,684

3622
03:24:29,961 --> 03:24:33,554
Alright, then we're going Those are pretty cool. They're just spinning out the sand.

3623
03:24:34,161 --> 03:24:37,142
I got this many columns this side, and it's many ranges that I just

3624
03:24:37,143 --> 03:24:39,503
can tell you everything. We'll see in the next Well, we did.

3625
03:24:39,504 --> 03:24:41,511
Five times the same thing. It's all gone. It's all gone.

3626
03:24:41,512 --> 03:24:43,568
It's done. It's done. It's done. Ah, it's done.

3627
03:24:43,569 --> 03:24:52,053
So. Tell

3628
03:24:52,054 --> 03:24:54,730
them where you get it, if you have good relationships with the owner.

3629
03:24:54,847 --> 03:24:57,844
Okay. The owner of the horse is going to give it to the ad.

I don't know how it'll be.

3644
03:25:59,558 --> 03:26:01,576
You know, food goes with knowledge and fact.

3645
03:26:01,577 --> 03:26:04,034
Yeah, only in front of the bus,

3646
03:26:04,035 --> 03:26:09,680
I'm getting sure you've done things better. That's what I had to If

a few things. I have a clue that we can even run a few

3676
03:28:02,716 --> 03:28:07,994
I'm a great one, but it's a little more about their looking at

3677
03:28:07,995 --> 03:28:11,508
their own. Alright, thanks. I'm a good one. I'm good one.

3680
03:28:18,387 --> 03:28:21,898

3681
03:28:21,899 --> 03:28:25,646
it, the game will set them. You never got to follow what's going on

3682
03:28:25,647 --> 03:28:27,731
in your day. If you don't get it done,

3683
03:28:27,732 --> 03:28:31,295
...that's the best time that you can save a lot of money.

3684
03:28:32,647 --> 03:28:35,400
I'm going to have to go with it. I'm sorry.

3694
03:29:08,255 --> 03:29:11,367
We'll see the next in the cloud if they didn't find it to be

3695
03:29:11,368 --> 03:29:14,942
misused. And I've been, like, twice as me.

3703
03:29:55,001 --> 03:29:58,661

But, I don't know if it's stressful,

3754
03:32:27,709 --> 03:32:29,951
but I think, in this role of,

3755
03:32:29,952 --> 03:32:32,505
in this process, I'm connected. definitely. but new,

3756
03:32:32,506 --> 03:32:35,781
too. But, uh, I didn't receive the new chapter,

3757
03:32:35,930 --> 03:32:38,018
and shouldn't have been time for a little later, tough.

3758
03:32:39,083 --> 03:32:42,354
and walk by the way. Billing Loom's 200, I am really into the making

3759
03:32:42,355 --> 03:32:44,874
of the world with our certain changes.

3760
03:32:44,875 --> 03:32:47,831
Yeah, it was in the video to 15% of it.

3761
03:32:51,321 --> 03:32:52,390
I thought I was going to turn Okay.

3762
03:32:56,891 --> 03:33:01,558
Excuse me. I was having dinner

3763
03:33:01,559 --> 03:33:07,068
from my phone. Okay. Hm.

3764
03:33:07,069 --> 03:33:08,081
you

3765
03:33:14,831 --> 03:33:17,214
I thought it would be a hundred years,

3766
03:33:17,215 --> 03:33:18,710
so it would be a thing to look like that. Good.

3767
03:33:22,871 --> 03:33:26,626
And some bits of it.

3768
03:33:26,745 --> 03:33:29,434
Yeah, it is. I'm talking, huh?

3769
03:33:29,435 --> 03:33:31,688
Yeah. I can't. I'm forgetting.

3770
03:33:31,689 --> 03:33:34,603
Thank you. . . How many?

3771
03:33:37,363 --> 03:33:39,623
Oh. There you go.

3772
03:33:39,624 --> 03:33:44,261

3773
03:33:44,262 --> 03:33:49,039
is five. Ah, ah, ah. And

3774
03:33:49,142 --> 03:33:51,728
I've heard a lot of people are yelling that in fact we've had a

3775
03:33:51,729 --> 03:33:55,936
story about it. to they don't have Right.

3776
03:33:55,552 --> 03:34:00,372

I'm really good.

3780
03:34:20,051 --> 03:34:22,932
It's basically about service every time of the day.

3781
03:34:23,791 --> 03:34:28,096
I'll hear it.

3782
03:34:28,097 --> 03:34:30,255
It's tough to really remember that with fixing.

3783
03:34:30,565 --> 03:34:32,899
You know, I don't understand why with all the fixing,

3784
03:34:32,975 --> 03:34:35,000
I think, you don't talk with guys.

3785
03:34:35,470 --> 03:34:37,650
Don't say no. I love you. Wai, aa, aa, aa, aa,

aa, aa, aa, ha, ha, ha, Is that really,

3787
03:34:40,536 --> 03:34:43,627
I think, I think the sports have a very heavy.

3788
03:34:43,628 --> 03:34:46,245
Yeah. You I've got plenty of things I've done since then.

3789
03:34:46,246 --> 03:34:48,830
I started there, started in the forest,

3790
03:34:48,831 --> 03:34:50,840
and it felt like three months ago.

3791
03:34:50,841 --> 03:34:53,729
I wouldn't even have to buy something like that. No,

3792
03:34:53,730 --> 03:34:56,755
no, no,

3793
03:34:56,756 --> 03:34:59,780
no, no.

3794
03:35:04,743 --> 03:35:08,291
I'm gonna go.

3795
03:35:08,292 --> 03:35:10,487
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna fishing my parks.

3796
03:35:10,488 --> 03:35:13,254

3797
03:35:13,255 --> 03:35:15,552
and the other one's gonna work. Alright?

3798
03:35:15,553 --> 03:35:17,788
So, I'm gonna go to the other side,

3799
03:35:18,009 --> 03:35:20,393
and then I'm gonna go to the apartment piece. Well, it's gonna be a

3800
03:35:20,394 --> 03:35:22,725
month or two minutes. I'm second area.

3801
03:35:23,180 --> 03:35:27,159
I'll push forward. Thank you. Love. You have to have your relationship with someone

3802
03:35:27,160 --> 03:35:30,145
taking a car, but if you think I should listen to you,

3803
03:35:30,146 --> 03:35:32,416
it's Mr. Woodhead. Bye. Bye.

3804

I'm just gonna keep working with my car. You know what I mean?

3805
03:35:34,944 --> 03:35:37,257
I think I should listen to the clarity of what's coming up.

3806
03:35:37,258 --> 03:35:39,755
It's on, you know what I mean? Okay,

3807
03:35:39,867 --> 03:35:44,508

3808
03:35:44,509 --> 03:35:47,776

3809
03:35:47,777 --> 03:35:52,900
tell me exactly what's going to happen? It could

3810
03:35:52,901 --> 03:35:56,531
find a small risk.

3811
03:35:56,532 --> 03:35:58,862
It could find a risk. How's it is? This time,

3812
03:35:59,456 --> 03:36:01,740
thanks. You're going to be like, I'm going to do three balls of training.

You're going to win. That's the matter. Shit.

3814
03:36:04,572 --> 03:36:06,745
You can't even touch it. Get it on.

3815
03:36:07,163 --> 03:36:09,796
Just a little bit. There's just a large pair of shorts to tell.

3816
03:36:09,797 --> 03:36:12,611
Yeah, okay, it's very fast. Thank you Thank you.

3817
03:36:12,612 --> 03:36:15,122
It's about the line, uh, in the heat that I was in.

3818
03:36:15,686 --> 03:36:18,694
Yeah, they still, man. New years ago, I had a cow that went through

3819
03:36:18,695 --> 03:36:21,242
a smiley. I'll do it. And so,

3820
03:36:21,243 --> 03:36:25,115
again, moving to the same thing that you're doing back to the moving bit

3821
03:36:25,613 --> 03:36:27,838
of this b****. I learned a lot.

3822
03:36:27,839 --> 03:36:30,887
I can see that. Who peeps on like souring you now?

3823
03:36:30,888 --> 03:36:32,979
Is that what you mean? Is it better?

3824
03:36:33,156 --> 03:36:36,731
What is it? Oh, it's so good.

3825
03:36:36,732 --> 03:36:38,910
. . You cannot tell if you can get up with a slick thing

3826
03:36:39,222 --> 03:36:41,897
and feel like you have to error. You can just leave it all on

3827
03:36:41,898 --> 03:36:44,145
the end of this and get into the end of your dominance.

3828
03:36:44,394 --> 03:36:46,711
It's like 5. Thanks so much everyone.

3829
03:36:46,712 --> 03:36:49,084
That was important. If you want to do that,

3830
03:36:49,085 --> 03:36:51,850
I can find it but it's been a real similar company.

3834
03:37:07,004 --> 03:37:11,823
Bye. People in the office are beautiful,

3835
03:37:11,824 --> 03:37:16,488

3836
03:37:16,489 --> 03:37:19,227
make it. Good. Alright, this is gonna help us learn even if I'm less

3837
03:37:19,228 --> 03:37:21,881
than best known. Yeah, it's a good thing.

3838
03:37:23,811 --> 03:37:26,460
Have a good year. . . . . . Taht, exploring your I think,

3839
03:37:26,461 --> 03:37:29,339
oh my god! I'm just looking for a rest, I'm just for a rest,

3840
03:37:29,340 --> 03:37:31,376

3841
03:37:31,566 --> 03:37:36,155
under, a***, good good. and, and there was a move here

3842
03:37:36,156 --> 03:37:39,302
to kill me. Yeah. First bad, not bad,

3843
03:37:39,518 --> 03:37:42,629
on the knees, you know. Thank you. Yeah.

3844
03:37:42,630 --> 03:37:45,586
Um, but I think that means a little slower.

3845
03:37:45,739 --> 03:37:48,040
I don't see any replies that you want it to be used in the

3846
03:37:48,041 --> 03:37:51,026
bottom, so yeah. and they invited me to the festival.

3847
03:37:51,027 --> 03:37:53,670
They don't know what's going on in summer.

3848
03:37:53,671 --> 03:37:57,072
They want to be on the festival and they want me to work.

3849
03:37:57,073 --> 03:37:59,493
You know what the best better thing is. Oh yeah, you know what the

3850
03:37:59,494 --> 03:38:02,933
staff are doing. I need to learn it. So talk to everyone else.

3851
03:38:03,026 --> 03:38:05,176
Yeah. Hehehehehe.

3852
03:38:08,980 --> 03:38:12,832
It's time to know what you know and what you can So,

3853
03:38:12,833 --> 03:38:15,461
thank you. And uh I have progress, but I didn't think that,

3854
03:38:15,462 --> 03:38:19,561
uhm, that's perfectly, we did have a little bit of a little bit of

3855
03:38:19,562 --> 03:38:21,895
a few, uhm, ok. Okay. Structures.

3856
03:38:22,451 --> 03:38:24,454
Now I'm going to do about a week now and a girl.

3857
03:38:24,903 --> 03:38:28,059
Okay, I need this fractional because we need this in,

3858
03:38:28,060 --> 03:38:31,329
in, in top of that. . Now that kid with that,

3859
03:38:31,389 --> 03:38:34,603
I'm like, I don't trust him.

3860
03:38:34,727 --> 03:38:37,336
So then I'm doing modern research on some of that.

3861
03:38:37,337 --> 03:38:40,242
I'm not I've been with that.

3862
03:38:40,243 --> 03:38:44,019
I'm like, I can only tell you that. I need to go to India,

3863
03:38:44,494 --> 03:38:46,357
I have to say. that's it. his . and then go on come down

3864
03:38:46,358 --> 03:38:50,574
and do it. He'll give you everything I can do in my area,

3865
03:38:50,575 --> 03:38:52,702
but I'm good to all of this in this movie.

3866
03:38:52,703 --> 03:38:54,359
We'll get to the next one. and you know how to do it. That's

3867
03:38:54,361 --> 03:38:57,137
correct. I mean, some may end up,

3868
03:38:57,138 --> 03:38:59,355
I'll just get the next option.

3869
03:38:59,356 --> 03:39:01,445
But I don't really work that so. Sure.

3870
03:39:01,446 --> 03:39:04,815
I have a lot of issues. I lot of issues here.

3871
03:39:05,156 --> 03:39:07,822
Here's how you do it so that we get what we're doing.

3872
03:39:08,056 --> 03:39:11,901
I think that's a little bit of work. Yeah, I think it probably grants.

3873
03:39:12,668 --> 03:39:15,420
Details on some cancer today, because it wasn't magic.

3874
03:39:15,803 --> 03:39:18,314
I think that's what it was like. The Army's really,

3875
03:39:18,315 --> 03:39:23,054
very well turned right. Ha ha ha ha. The stomach. So,

3876
03:39:23,055 --> 03:39:25,571
um, let me get it on. Okay.

3877
03:39:27,404 --> 03:39:31,655
I'll just, I'll just a piece. Go ahead and package.

3878
03:39:31,656 --> 03:39:33,851
I'm glad you got it.

3879
03:39:34,823 --> 03:39:39,688
I'm glad you got it. It's part of the Atlassian world.

3880
03:39:40,131 --> 03:39:44,217
Okay. Yes, thank you. Joe and because they live there,

3881
03:39:44,218 --> 03:39:47,268

3882
03:39:47,297 --> 03:39:49,996
yeah. Thank you.

3883
03:39:49,997 --> 03:39:52,236
Pat is also a very good guy.

3884
03:39:52,263 --> 03:39:56,335
I remember that was watching spin, rewrite all of the sudden,

3885
03:39:56,336 --> 03:39:59,579
and they don't get off. All right. and it has six Jira's in here,

3886
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:02,573
Loom, MediRoute, and the rest. He was supposed to be the two weeks,

3887
03:40:02,574 --> 03:40:06,436
right now, and it was six months. So he just went- I don't know

3888
03:40:06,437 --> 03:40:10,949
if it going to be a VPN, but we got some fades and stuff.

3889
03:40:11,403 --> 03:40:13,991
That's what we're concerned with is there's detail on being done.

3890
03:40:13,992 --> 03:40:16,015
I've done a multiple entity. Yeah,

3891
03:40:16,016 --> 03:40:18,860
I'm playing really the same way. Yeah,

3892
03:40:18,861 --> 03:40:21,816
just don't learn that this and stuff. I don't see that when I hear

3893
03:40:21,817 --> 03:40:25,185
this. I've got to do something properly. Let me out loud.

3894
03:40:25,432 --> 03:40:30,011
We ended up saying, let me out let out loud.

3895
03:40:30,012 --> 03:40:32,045
I've been sitting through Kid's ham in they used to beworld.

3896
03:40:32,046 --> 03:40:32,410
You know, if they were actually 5 or 6.ff. If they were subsogle so

3897
03:40:32,411 --> 03:40:37,318
I left you and I, how am I driving? And maybe somebody there.

3898
03:40:37,319 --> 03:40:40,118
Of of our standard uh,

3899
03:40:40,128 --> 03:40:44,939
compartments and what I don't want to do. And then put that sort

3900
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:47,784
of button on. Bye So now I'm on the trip with your dad.

3901
03:40:48,127 --> 03:40:51,042
So if you didn't want your dad was internal or external,

3902
03:40:51,043 --> 03:40:53,420
have you been doing a really good job? Better than that,

3903
03:40:53,421 --> 03:40:55,530
you know. As your father said, he said,

3904
03:40:55,531 --> 03:40:59,274
so that, that ain't a plot. But every single time as well,

3905
03:40:59,574 --> 03:41:01,340
thanks for all the details of your new dad. We'll see you in the

3906
03:41:02,051 --> 03:41:04,383
and we'll be talking about the lack of real knowledge.

3907
03:41:05,679 --> 03:41:09,424
We're trying to get the infertile detailer, some infertile detailer for this object to

3908
03:41:09,425 --> 03:41:11,962
get better. That's it. All right. Staying solid or stated,

3909
03:41:11,963 --> 03:41:14,132
it's like that. It's a library part,

3910
03:41:14,133 --> 03:41:16,558
and I said, check it out. She wanted it. But what will I do

3911
03:41:16,559 --> 03:41:19,652
that is, uhh, uhh, hm, this is the library part.

3912
03:41:20,425 --> 03:41:25,055
Like we saw in this problem

3913
03:41:25,056 --> 03:41:30,963
ten years ago. Yeah. Got it. Again,

3914
03:41:30,964 --> 03:41:34,996
kitty-tay-or-stop, maybe that, that, more. and then we will travel.

3915
03:41:34,997 --> 03:41:37,361
and every piece on the radio. I mean,

3916
03:41:37,362 --> 03:41:39,492
not that long before it was the front of it,

3917
03:41:39,493 --> 03:41:42,246
you know. He said we're going to have to ever make it.

3918
03:41:42,247 --> 03:41:44,288
We're going to have to. He said we're going to want to, you know,

3919
03:41:44,289 --> 03:41:48,249
rather than just be able to do this and actually drop it and it

3920
03:41:48,250 --> 03:41:50,760
tastes like. Yeah?

3921
03:41:50,590 --> 03:41:54,031
Yeah. I think, as I think, there's a better way to problem with the

3922
03:41:54,032 --> 03:41:56,338
ears, you know, not just to get the end done,

3923
03:41:56,339 --> 03:41:58,343
but from the past. Here's what I want to say.

3924
03:41:58,360 --> 03:42:02,408
I don't know about that. Yeah, I think everybody needs to realize more than

3925
03:42:02,409 --> 03:42:06,494
life, because if you're not in the second day project.

3926
03:42:06,597 --> 03:42:09,254
Yeah. Alright, and if I just, you can think about it,

3927
03:42:09,255 --> 03:42:19,049
it's probably already been done. Yeah. There go. It's

3928
03:42:19,050 --> 03:42:21,557
kind of funny. Here's a half a go.

3929
03:42:22,672 --> 03:42:24,874
They're building up speed. We'll see you then. Come on. There you go, out

3930
03:42:24,918 --> 03:42:27,166
there, in Boston. Be sure you love it,

3931
03:42:27,935 --> 03:42:29,508
isn't it? I love it, man. So I'm accepting it, I might see it

3932
03:42:29,509 --> 03:42:32,924
in all of this. So they can't even ask, is that? Yeah. We want

3933
03:42:32,925 --> 03:42:34,929
you guys to fill all cool events,

3934
03:42:35,245 --> 03:42:38,374
match, or, uh, exterior events. Okay,

3935
03:42:38,375 --> 03:42:40,622
we'll Okay. And we'll see you guys the next video. I mean, they're very

3936
03:42:40,623 --> 03:42:43,347
closely, you know, like when they didn't stop,

3937
03:42:43,348 --> 03:42:46,382
we heard you guys knew we were sharing. I'm like,

3938
03:42:46,784 --> 03:42:49,966
so look at them. Bye-bye. Okay.

3939
03:42:50,203 --> 03:42:53,259
They don't know if they want somebody to try out. They're like,

3940
03:42:53,260 --> 03:42:56,872
oooh, shit. That's how it is. Get the first They're just,

3941
03:42:56,873 --> 03:43:00,220
uh, I mean, this is what we made.

3942
03:43:00,221 --> 03:43:02,075
This is what we're going to do. We're going to do a huge road.

3943
03:43:02,076 --> 03:43:04,091
We can't do that. I mean, it's a big road.

3944
03:43:04,092 --> 03:43:07,122
and P.E.C.E. and B.E.L.U.

3945
03:43:07,123 --> 03:43:10,030
they just kept on on and on and on and on. It's like,

3946
03:43:10,031 --> 03:43:12,864
in the birds. Go down, B.E.L.U. Look at it.

3947
03:43:12,865 --> 03:43:15,112
Somebody's different. Hmmm,

3948
03:43:15,113 --> 03:43:17,733
they also do a pretty cool thing. I wanted to do a concept.

3949
03:43:17,734 --> 03:43:22,146
I mean, it's like a big, small thing to build. Hello. That's the best.

3950
03:43:22,147 --> 03:43:24,854
They're just panels, right? Hmmm,

3951
03:43:24,855 --> 03:43:28,005
panels that they want to be on the back of this negative.

3952
03:43:28,006 --> 03:43:30,859
you I'm pooling it. So, my right is like,

3953
03:43:31,214 --> 03:43:33,349
stands now, status, tubing,

3954
03:43:33,350 --> 03:43:36,001
and well on duty others, they're brilliant stuff.

3955
03:43:36,002 --> 03:43:38,704
you are. But they've made it like,

3956
03:43:38,705 --> 03:43:41,157
oh, the art, those new ones.

3957
03:43:41,158 --> 03:43:43,977
Can you hear what we'll test all that?

3958
03:43:43,978 --> 03:43:48,713
Bye. I think we have our own kids with their own kids by

3959
03:43:48,714 --> 03:43:53,268
hand. We'll see I wouldn't have been out

3960
03:43:53,269 --> 03:43:56,166
all well with so much for you, but I shouldn't have been out of

3961
03:43:56,167 --> 03:43:58,272
time. It's, it's, it's,

3962
03:43:58,354 --> 03:44:03,563
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I'm sorry. I'm not interested in the direction to

3963
03:44:03,564 --> 03:44:06,229
go too much. Enough. 10 years ago.

3964
03:44:06,230 --> 03:44:09,299
Don't worry about it. This way. It's not.

3965
03:44:09,300 --> 03:44:13,251
It's impossible. Yeah. I don't really want to convince you.

3966
03:44:13,252 --> 03:44:15,414
It's an experience. You know. Good.

3967
03:44:15,032 --> 03:44:19,785
Good. Oh, I've said this the best,

3968
03:44:19,786 --> 03:44:21,795
you know. I signed it up,

3969
03:44:21,796 --> 03:44:24,582
no, no, no, no. I don't,

3970

3972
03:44:34,712 --> 03:44:38,238
I've been here in Cincinnati. You know that I don't can handle that and

3973
03:44:38,239 --> 03:44:40,278
so on and so on. Periods to build what's up.

3974
03:44:40,279 --> 03:44:44,955
I mean,

3975
03:44:44,956 --> 03:44:47,350
it's, it's really, uh.

3976
03:44:47,550 --> 03:45:01,531
You really need and

3977
03:45:01,532 --> 03:45:04,391
Confluence. It's a very good one though.

3978
03:45:04,392 --> 03:45:10,891
I will see you a little All right. Umm,

Bye. Bye. Bye. Cool. Bye.

3986
03:45:58,121 --> 03:46:00,165
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It's in here.

3987
03:46:00,166 --> 03:46:02,391
I think it's in here.

3988
03:46:03,257 --> 03:46:06,996
here. you Confluence, Confluence, Confluence,

3989
03:46:07,090 --> 03:46:09,437
Confluence, Confluence,

3990
03:46:10,220 --> 03:46:12,771
Jira, Loom, So. Yeah, yeah.

3991
03:46:12,772 --> 03:46:16,864
Especially when you're working on this.

3992
03:46:16,865 --> 03:46:21,186
... I know,

3993
03:46:21,187 --> 03:46:23,259
yes, uhm. Check it out.

3994
03:46:23,260 --> 03:46:26,833
Yes, it's easy. It's not right.

3995
03:46:27,409 --> 03:46:29,410
You want me to- They're all silly.

3996
03:46:30,351 --> 03:46:32,851
And, uhm, the entire property of MediRoute,

3997
03:46:33,292 --> 03:46:35,937
and they ask, uhm, which we keep coping with.

3998
03:46:35,938 --> 03:46:39,339
and I'm very for it.

3999
03:46:39,340 --> 03:46:42,751
So, I'm very nice to meet with Kay and I'm going to be used

4000
03:46:42,752 --> 03:46:46,332
to be good. Good. because you can do that on with the video.

4001
03:46:47,653 --> 03:46:51,835
All the trades will actually look forward to the end of the video.

4002
03:46:51,836 --> 03:46:56,553
Bye! If you really can, you can get information from all the time

4003
03:46:56,692 --> 03:46:58,867
to the movement. So.

4004
03:46:58,356 --> 03:47:00,739
So. Word,

4005
03:47:01,664 --> 03:47:03,721
that send me over on a bit of information,

4006
03:47:03,722 --> 03:47:06,102
and I'll try to say it on the phone,

4007
03:47:06,103 --> 03:47:08,111
it's alright. Come on in.

4008
03:47:08,112 --> 03:47:12,068
On a phone for me, make sure that it's right where you did that.

4009
03:47:13,271 --> 03:47:15,384
Cause it's a little more like you've done with it. Yeah.

4010
03:47:15,744 --> 03:47:17,806
Bye bye. It's an ancient world.

4011
03:47:17,990 --> 03:47:21,482
Tell me. It's great to meet you too.

4012
03:47:22,081 --> 03:47:25,271
You know, building for the- They buy a metal building,

4013
03:47:25,272 --> 03:47:29,596
or if somebody is on a building. It's up at very nice and loose,

4014
03:47:29,597 --> 03:47:31,638
up at 30%.

4015
03:47:31,639 --> 03:47:34,041
Bitbucket. I figured I'd be, you know, straight lines,

4016
03:47:34,042 --> 03:47:36,413
uh, uh, what to do with one.

4017
03:47:36,744 --> 03:47:39,618
So, like, it was really, uh, oh, I need to adapt both of you.

4018
03:47:39,619 --> 03:47:43,467
Like, a lot. I'm ready and it's on free. I've been eating stuff straight

4019
03:47:43,468 --> 03:47:46,373
ever. I've been doing that too. So,

4020
03:47:46,374 --> 03:47:49,323
I'm doing all of that acid. That's my first move. Just go I think.

4021
03:47:50,460 --> 03:47:52,959
There's a guy in there. He's over there. I showed up with me for

4022
03:47:52,998 --> 03:47:56,220
what you think of that guy. See in a minute.

4023
03:48:04,211 --> 03:48:06,567
I'm going to see a difference. That's,

4024
03:48:06,568 --> 03:48:08,924
uh, I shouldn't be able to put us in a long,

4025
03:48:08,925 --> 03:48:11,323
uh, first speaking, so I ain't going to have to get away in this

4026
03:48:11,324 --> 03:48:13,479
over here. Eh, and uh. No, no, no, no, no,

4027
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:16,100
no. They expanded the B market.

4028
03:48:16,573 --> 03:48:20,151
Now they are, uh, chief of D is one of our most competitive vendors.

4029
03:48:20,152 --> 03:48:24,235
and and those very effectively. So they have one last minute or a whole

4030
03:48:24,236 --> 03:48:26,447
couple of topics. They have uh.

4031
03:48:26,458 --> 03:48:31,091
Go. One Closetman with a

4032
03:48:31,092 --> 03:48:33,936
50% option.

4033
03:48:34,164 --> 03:48:38,150
And that is sort of it. They have a- The secondary yard of that

4034
03:48:38,151 --> 03:48:40,484
has two 60 potatoes,

4035
03:48:40,935 --> 03:48:44,785
and they also are usually fine. Bye So,

4036
03:48:44,786 --> 03:48:47,187
focal line is low,

4037
03:48:47,188 --> 03:48:49,405
uhh, Delta,

4038
03:48:49,406 --> 03:48:52,391
Bart Smith and Loom.

4039
03:48:52,392 --> 03:48:54,939
So, now Delta, Dot, Reliance.

4040
03:48:54,940 --> 03:48:57,104
Umm,

4041
03:48:57,114 --> 03:48:59,295
now Delta, Loom is all of it,

4042
03:48:59,296 --> 03:49:03,096
which is why they're trying to- I couldn't really renew that facility here,

4043
03:49:03,097 --> 03:49:06,191
uh, I'll try to get it in one of their lives over the deep

4044
03:49:06,192 --> 03:49:08,747
so Yeah,

4045
03:49:08,983 --> 03:49:11,413
but I hope not to have the token, so it would be in this

4046
03:49:12,267 --> 03:49:15,684
huge literally thing for a whole lot.

4047
03:49:15,685 --> 03:49:18,345
Good. In general, I want to have the token,

4048
03:49:18,346 --> 03:49:20,935
and cut it. Yeah. You don't need to do that.

4049
03:49:21,225 --> 03:49:23,442
So I can get lots of links on, um,

4050
03:49:23,452 --> 03:49:26,069
super easily. in the sky. Nice. Yes.

4051
03:49:26,764 --> 03:49:31,791
They, uhm, they've been through a couple of months for everything,

4052
03:49:31,792 --> 03:49:35,555
and we've all- Requesting to them. Even on one and a quarter,

4053
03:49:35,556 --> 03:49:39,048
at least they do a special no-one for all of those.

4054
03:49:39,665 --> 03:49:42,390
They brought everything in. That brings me,

4055
03:49:42,391 --> 03:49:46,346
if you mind, the first part, you have a kiss. And if we use

4056
03:49:46,347 --> 03:49:48,676
that moment, it's here in London. I'm done.

4057
03:49:48,677 --> 03:49:51,187
But it would be only put in the small,

4058
03:49:51,188 --> 03:49:54,637
say, you know, hat the truck or whatever.

4059
03:49:54,849 --> 03:49:57,318
Oh, yeah. Go. Now the,

4060
03:49:57,319 --> 03:49:59,323
uh, I'm going to grab you from the small,

4061
03:49:59,324 --> 03:50:01,525
snip. Just make that boxy, you know.

4062
03:50:01,526 --> 03:50:03,816
Yeah. Yeah,

4063
03:50:03,980 --> 03:50:08,584
that'll build in. and then they have a cable board

4064
03:50:08,585 --> 03:50:11,596
with them in front of us.

4065
03:50:11,597 --> 03:50:14,358
this. . and, uuh,

4066
03:50:14,401 --> 03:50:14,582
no

4067
03:50:20,831 --> 03:50:25,513
That pretty soon the service

4068
03:50:25,514 --> 03:50:28,269
centers are gonna do the people doing the beam line and stuff.

4069
03:50:28,270 --> 03:50:31,197
Love. Yeah, you don't think it's gonna be,

4070
03:50:31,246 --> 03:50:34,607
yeah. So I have to do the first line for it.

4071
03:50:35,699 --> 03:50:40,040
Just follow your head, click first. The person's gonna put a pipe processing center

4072
03:50:40,041 --> 03:50:42,535
in right here, across the bottom there,

4073
03:50:43,325 --> 03:50:48,467
just a little bit more. You I

4074
03:50:48,468 --> 03:50:51,550
got land, everything, I got a super center right next to it. Take care.

4075
03:50:51,551 --> 03:50:54,103
He's the move. I'm going to do it. and so that's going to be

4076
03:50:54,104 --> 03:50:58,618
good to look. Yeah, it's sad. I'll go ahead and I'll associate

4077
03:50:58,619 --> 03:51:03,148
it. So you have to get the- I'll associate it now and

4078
03:51:03,149 --> 03:51:06,227
I'll make it as a mission. It's size,

4079
03:51:06,228 --> 03:51:09,854
but it's a lot of paper. It's used in shafts,

4080
03:51:09,855 --> 03:51:13,333
it's- these are service centers to bring in anything,

4081
03:51:14,589 --> 03:51:18,191
partially finished. It can be.

4082
03:51:18,192 --> 03:51:23,191
I

4083
03:51:25,406 --> 03:51:28,054
just had a little bit of a scary. Good. Hell, they call those service

4084
03:51:28,055 --> 03:51:31,253
owners, you know, one company that bought a lot of service owners.

4085
03:51:31,254 --> 03:51:33,647
Well, they wanted to go out with a positive guy,

4086
03:51:33,648 --> 03:51:36,365
just like me. Alright, guys soon. Yeah, I feel a little bit.

4087
03:51:36,366 --> 03:51:41,608
I will be very close to the

4088
03:51:41,609 --> 03:51:44,666
trial. Last one, Compass. This All right,

4089
03:51:44,667 --> 03:51:46,676
I can just see it. I mean, you're trying to knock it out,

4090
03:51:46,677 --> 03:51:48,985
but not. These days,

4091
03:51:48,986 --> 03:51:51,683
they're going to just have 5D months there and just be here.

4092
03:51:51,684 --> 03:51:54,328
It's costless. Church. Yeah, I'm fine.

4093
03:51:57,306 --> 03:51:59,509
Puffin. Atlassian receives,

4094
03:51:59,510 --> 03:52:01,746
uh, ehm. You Sam. Yeah. So, Rovo,

4095
03:52:01,747 --> 03:52:06,897
this is where it does.

4096
03:52:06,898 --> 03:52:09,225
They can kill the shear. I mean, all tariffs.

4097
03:52:10,507 --> 03:52:15,134
I don't see it on fushion. They can pass through and look through it.

4098
03:52:15,135 --> 03:52:17,328
That's right. Okay,

4099
03:52:17,329 --> 03:52:20,516
I'm close, I need a sec. Alright.

4100
03:52:22,059 --> 03:52:25,662
That's Umm,

4101
03:52:25,673 --> 03:52:29,169
the price is ideal, the maximum amount is quite cheap right here.

4102
03:52:29,246 --> 03:52:31,878
Excuse me then, we will buy an unstructured pen.

4103
03:52:31,944 --> 03:52:32,231
Thank you.

4104
03:52:37,004 --> 03:52:40,296
You know,

4105
03:52:40,297 --> 03:52:42,960
it is totally right, it's a pursuit.

4106
03:52:43,550 --> 03:52:48,064
Oh, you're back on the text. Don't go, don't go, David. Stay

4107
03:52:48,065 --> 03:52:51,926
with us, The crazy trucks come on the rain, so it means they,

4108
03:52:51,927 --> 03:52:56,002
uh, didn't sound like they're seeing what was driving them.

4109
03:52:56,003 --> 03:52:58,435
one. All right, let's see.

4110
03:52:58,597 --> 03:53:01,035
Alright, now we have a shop in next, in next.

4111
03:53:01,388 --> 03:53:03,726
Next couple of guys we have, and then the brand new factory,

4112
03:53:03,727 --> 03:53:06,274
we have something. Okay. We're coming across, yeah,

4113
03:53:06,275 --> 03:53:10,502
and I'll put it. Oh, yes, I'll put it. Um,

4114
03:53:10,513 --> 03:53:13,895
let's just say we got, do we have it? you. and certainly,

4115
03:53:15,806 --> 03:53:18,521
you know, you can have more, like, you can kind of publish it.

4116
03:53:18,522 --> 03:53:20,800
If you have 10 minutes, or you can- I believe it.

4117
03:53:21,570 --> 03:53:25,534
Chill on this side, chill on that side. So they all have to be

4118
03:53:26,177 --> 03:53:28,733
on money. and we will the next but I said,

4119
03:53:29,140 --> 03:53:33,358
you can't much, you've worked it out. Or it was all ends up business,

4120
03:53:33,359 --> 03:53:36,251
it's always done. So. So.

4121
03:53:36,252 --> 03:53:40,565
I can't see how the U.S. ever competes for us.

4122
03:53:42,282 --> 03:53:48,596
I can tell you that. Thank you. Share

4123

ehm. There they are going to be.

4128
03:54:05,194 --> 03:54:10,110
I'm going to show them what they're doing. There you go. Okay. My leggers

4129
03:54:10,309 --> 03:54:12,571
are not saying it's free, but it's, you know,

4130
03:54:12,962 --> 03:54:15,371
hyper. I didn't know why I didn't do that.

4131
03:54:15,372 --> 03:54:19,854
I know. Uhh,

4132
03:54:19,865 --> 03:54:24,198
that's good. Try it in a circle, don't go. I mean 17.

4133
03:54:24,199 --> 03:54:26,728
You'd actually think that you're not happy about . . Okay,

4134
03:54:26,729 --> 03:54:29,179
alright. okay. Great. It wasn't that great around,

4135
03:54:29,779 --> 03:54:32,036
I thought we'd try to help put the earlop next time.

4136
03:54:32,040 --> 03:54:34,091
No. Go ahead and try it out, and check out his lip.

4137
03:54:34,092 --> 03:54:38,132
I just got out of the period of time about Tira.

4138
03:54:38,133 --> 03:54:40,521
They went, they went so far, like,

4139
03:54:40,522 --> 03:54:45,148
we had new, umm. includes before we're getting some thoughts into the bushes,

4140
03:54:45,255 --> 03:54:47,398
like all the bushes were fighting for punkers, right?

4141
03:54:47,622 --> 03:54:50,171
Hmmm, and then it then popped. That's it.

4142
03:54:50,172 --> 03:54:53,594
and I have this footage of who is getting them in thermal oxidizers and

4143
03:54:53,595 --> 03:54:57,108
they put thermal out, then you can repart the brain through the staff that

4144
03:54:57,117 --> 03:55:01,014
are on the thermal oxidizer. You know, the rest of the strategy is,

4145
03:55:02,583 --> 03:55:04,145
you know, within the pool is where, uhh, it's all in that, it's something

4146
03:55:04,146 --> 03:55:09,685
that really is interesting. Alright. I

4147
03:55:09,822 --> 03:55:12,127
don't know if you can look at this video, if that's in China,

4148
03:55:12,146 --> 03:55:14,291
you can see it in a certain way. Okay.

4149
03:55:14,292 --> 03:55:18,615
And,

4150
03:55:18,616 --> 03:55:22,219

Oh, I can, I can't even, I can't even, I can't my hands to

4202
03:58:18,545 --> 03:58:20,801
start out anymore. I like that, I like that.

4203
03:58:20,888 --> 03:58:23,755
But you go through it, we go through the style, we go through the

4204
03:58:23,757 --> 03:58:26,011
PDN. This is still cheaper to go, yeah? I do it quicker.

4205
03:58:26,012 --> 03:58:28,709
And we're going. I'll in the Hola.

4206
03:58:28,710 --> 03:58:27,600
Okay.

4207
03:58:35,411 --> 03:58:37,611

4208
03:58:37,612 --> 03:58:46,387
yes sir. Thank you, Chairman. Okay.

4209
03:58:46,388 --> 03:58:51,825
You're not gonna lie.

4210
03:58:52,006 --> 03:58:57,333
Bye I think that's a big thing.

4211
03:58:57,334 --> 03:58:59,869
If you want to take care of it, no. It has to be.

4212
03:58:59,870 --> 03:59:02,921
I'll right back a It's a little bit dark in here,

4213
03:59:03,138 --> 03:59:06,309
so let me look at the image. We can see that we have the

4214
03:59:06,310 --> 03:59:08,351
only video. Come on.

4215
03:59:08,352 --> 03:59:10,356
? You'll be here with the other one.

4216
03:59:10,628 --> 03:59:12,330
It's a very good amount. It's a stand in prison. It just came under

4217
03:59:12,331 --> 03:59:16,040
the house. It came under the house. It under the So. Because all probability.

4218
03:59:16,041 --> 03:59:18,570
Six from Beethoven. Umm. Umm.

4219
03:59:18,571 --> 03:59:23,570

4221
03:59:31,208 --> 03:59:36,208
Umm.

4222
03:59:59,411 --> 04:00:04,187
We'll be right

4223
04:00:04,191 --> 04:00:07,077
back to the end of the day. Check it out.

4224
04:00:07,166 --> 04:00:11,175
Bye. Alright.

4225
04:00:11,176 --> 04:00:20,723
Sit. Sit. Okay. Well,

4226
04:00:20,775 --> 04:00:26,835
put your foot in and into it. Alright. Okay, good, let's go Atlassian.

4227
04:00:27,128 --> 04:00:29,160
Oh, they're gonna be listening out.

4228
04:00:31,212 --> 04:00:31,871
Okay. And there's the-

4229
04:00:37,106 --> 04:00:39,916
I'm sure they're different. That's what I'm talking about.

4230
04:00:39,917 --> 04:00:43,723
. . . Bixx. Bixx.

4231
04:00:44,490 --> 04:00:46,495
Bixx.

4232
04:00:46,496 --> 04:00:49,437
Bixx. Bixx. Bixx. Bixx. Bixx.

4233
04:00:56,411 --> 04:00:58,885
Umm, so I'm typing the words,

4234
04:00:59,019 --> 04:01:02,851
you know, twice as soon as they're in the media fashion.

4235
04:01:02,852 --> 04:01:05,095
Or to ask them, like, me and Mrs. Bixx. Pophead,

4236
04:01:05,339 --> 04:01:07,963
I'm just hearted in the name, where I should be.

4237
04:01:08,197 --> 04:01:11,417
It's, it's like a $7.00.

4238
04:01:11,418 --> 04:01:15,430
It's a $7.00. It is important to me,

4239
04:01:15,431 --> 04:01:18,972
huh? I should probably, uh, put this in some food,

4240
04:01:18,973 --> 04:01:21,647
so that you can eat all of me. Yup, it's the dollar,

4241
04:01:21,648 --> 04:01:23,868
it's after printing, the door actually,

4242
04:01:23,869 --> 04:01:25,871
it's one side of us and all of them. I think that's it,

4243
04:01:25,872 --> 04:01:28,396
shins. and next Thank you.

4244
04:01:28,397 --> 04:01:34,492
Thank you, Mario. Here's

4245
04:01:35,602 --> 04:01:38,708
another. Okay. It's out.

4246
04:01:40,487 --> 04:01:42,725
All of you very much. I'm not sure what you're giving me.

4247
04:01:43,513 --> 04:01:46,545
Two minutes. Let's I'm hit it.

4248
04:01:46,546 --> 04:01:48,576
She's not going to show you that.

4249
04:01:48,577 --> 04:01:51,417
She's not going to leave it. It's not what I was going to do.

4250
04:01:52,081 --> 04:01:53,112
Basically, great. Yeah.

4251
04:02:02,411 --> 04:02:06,639
Mmm.

4252
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:10,163
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

4253
04:02:10,164 --> 04:02:12,240
. . Alright,

4254
04:02:13,972 --> 04:02:20,674
so we need to believe that we need to do

4255
04:02:20,680 --> 04:02:24,012
some of the things. So we have a variety of things we like,

4256
04:02:24,370 --> 04:02:27,587
but we try to make that do a little bit of stuff.

4257
04:02:27,588 --> 04:02:30,113
I didn't look at it. You know what I was talking about.

4258
04:02:30,114 --> 04:02:32,702
Umm, you can do that.

4259
04:02:32,703 --> 04:02:35,861
Umm, it's fresh. And speed.

4260
04:02:35,862 --> 04:02:38,332
me. There's that 3-1 of the iPad, 4-1 of the Galaxy.

4261
04:02:38,816 --> 04:02:43,538
Plus, they're not. It's going to be able to come in next time.

4262
04:02:43,539 --> 04:02:46,719
Now then, we can look for- and almost ready to look at it.

4263
04:02:46,720 --> 04:02:49,521
Umm, I have made a big video,

4264
04:02:49,522 --> 04:02:52,163
it's it's, it's been happening professionally.

4265
04:02:52,164 --> 04:02:55,220
I'll see I'm going show you the answers. I'm going Yes.

4266
04:03:00,611 --> 04:03:04,999
Okay.

4267
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:09,413
Mm-hmm. eh,

4268
04:03:10,523 --> 04:03:13,220
hehe. Ooh plasma. His phse size.

4269
04:03:13,221 --> 04:03:16,078
I'm not if I'm giving something else there than he see.

4270
04:03:16,079 --> 04:03:18,701
lip must be. . . Gee, you think about it.

4271
04:03:18,702 --> 04:03:21,457
What's your answer to that? It's a fine thing.

4272
04:03:21,458 --> 04:03:23,936
It's really horrible. You can say anything and say one. So, it should be

4273
04:03:23,937 --> 04:03:28,260
like that. I don't have time at the time to see if I can

4274
04:03:28,261 --> 04:03:36,021
share it a lot. in

4275
04:03:36,022 --> 04:03:38,961
my sense. It's very good on the side.

4276
04:03:38,962 --> 04:03:40,592
I'm doing I don't know if I can share it with you. See you

4277
04:03:40,593 --> 04:03:44,106
in a minute. Bollywood, Swerve, MediRoute, Umm,

4278
04:03:44,116 --> 04:03:46,313
Ejisha, Umm, Junjung,

4279
04:03:46,314 --> 04:03:48,856
Statuspage. Now, back here's it.

4280
04:03:48,857 --> 04:03:51,202
. . It's a little bit better, but I'm not going to still get

4281
04:03:51,203 --> 04:03:53,358
hurt in this thing. I don't think we can talk about it.

4282
04:03:53,663 --> 04:03:56,421
We need to invest it. And it won't be as far away as it

4283
04:03:56,422 --> 04:03:58,666
can Have a good day. I don't think we can talk about it.

4284
04:03:59,604 --> 04:04:04,989
I don't think we can talk about You

4285
04:04:04,990 --> 04:04:08,343
don't need to use apps to do it either. Whatever the clock is.

4286
04:04:08,344 --> 04:04:11,878
Umm, I'm gonna shoot the salad at Tonya's and then Jamie's food.

4287
04:04:11,879 --> 04:04:16,548
Thank you. I think it's not only because it's not for the Bitbucket,

4288
04:04:16,549 --> 04:04:18,988
but it's not for the Bitbucket, it's for any cheese.

4289
04:04:19,909 --> 04:04:22,635
It's strong. You right.

4290
04:04:22,734 --> 04:04:26,337
But, no one's trained on that. It's almost as long as there's something in

4291
04:04:26,338 --> 04:04:29,946
it as much. much.

4292
04:04:30,928 --> 04:04:39,234
Come on back shall. Time to be back to No,

4293
04:04:39,235 --> 04:04:43,041
no, no, no,

4294
04:04:44,230 --> 04:04:49,497
Abhay. In hella with the E-VOC,

4295
04:04:49,498 --> 04:04:52,696
I'm not E-VOC.

4296
04:04:52,697 --> 04:04:55,170
I'm not in love with the E I'm from.M.

4297
04:04:55,171 --> 04:04:58,337
I've seen people in the U.M. but where to Nah,

4298
04:04:58,338 --> 04:05:00,492
it's going to be going to be negative. time. Not We'll be increasing. You've

4299
04:05:00,493 --> 04:05:03,418
used aially. I've got my, No. The details in when I use this chit

4300
04:05:03,419 --> 04:05:05,854
chat, I don't know if it might be a show or it might not

4301
04:05:06,944 --> 04:05:09,251
the time to act for more because it's time to work up.

4302
04:05:12,295 --> 04:05:15,355
Mmm, Mmm,

4303
04:05:15,356 --> 04:05:17,648
Mmm, Mmm. I'm in. Mmm.

4304
04:05:17,649 --> 04:05:20,008
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

4305
04:05:20,009 --> 04:05:25,008
I

4306
04:05:30,781 --> 04:05:33,611
think that's part of the reason.

4307
04:05:33,612 --> 04:05:35,625
Stop.

4308
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:37,545
So if I were to stop, I would have to take it.

4309
04:06:23,591 --> 04:06:27,246
Hit that button.

4310
04:06:27,267 --> 04:06:30,591
It was a spin, and you should be listening.

4311
04:06:30,592 --> 04:06:32,763
Uh, it was a lot closer than I expected. I don't know. I've never

4312
04:06:32,768 --> 04:06:36,346
met a company. I've never met a company. And I love to be there.

4313
04:06:36,350 --> 04:06:39,392
So I've been finishing this like, eight dollars in the day.

4314
04:06:39,393 --> 04:06:41,561
Oh shit. Language Tider.

4315
04:06:41,679 --> 04:06:45,013
No, you need to be on my burger. Umm,

4316
04:06:45,024 --> 04:06:47,405
it's good. Plus I was good.

4317
04:06:47,406 --> 04:06:49,836
Good. But there should be a separate one.

4318
04:06:50,259 --> 04:06:52,574
Or back to double check that. Because that's the case.

4319
04:06:53,242 --> 04:06:58,029
For old. But. want to talk about market

4320
04:06:58,030 --> 04:07:00,613
market. Yes. That's good to see many.

4321
04:07:00,958 --> 04:07:04,576
He might have been strong with 100 mayors. That was great shit.

4322
04:07:04,577 --> 04:07:07,635
I'm going to put it somewhere else in here. In and out.

4323
04:07:09,411 --> 04:07:12,280
It's 17. 17.

4324
04:07:12,551 --> 04:07:16,805
He hurts me. Heh.

4325
04:07:16,806 --> 04:07:17,242
Heh.

4326
04:07:24,168 --> 04:07:28,898
I don't think

4327
04:07:28,899 --> 04:07:30,422
I estimated this. Yes, I mean the third. . . So it's fine on

4328
04:07:30,423 --> 04:07:35,191
the earth. That's the big thing.

4329
04:07:35,887 --> 04:07:37,991
That's the one they have, ehm. No.

4330
04:07:37,992 --> 04:07:40,120
I think you were supposed to be pushing on your back.

4331
04:07:40,788 --> 04:07:43,330
That's a, you know, cheater. Yeah.

4332
04:07:44,573 --> 04:07:47,379
So I'll tell you how to get Umm, just go back and take a

4333
04:07:47,594 --> 04:07:50,460
GIC and see what, uh, what are you want me to do?

4334
04:07:51,102 --> 04:07:54,071
I'm going to buy you a little.

4335
04:07:54,072 --> 04:07:56,241
. . He's still big with him,

4336
04:07:56,242 --> 04:07:58,885
but I'm just not interested. He's still in the car?

4337
04:07:59,397 --> 04:08:01,764
Yeah, because they have both there, so they give a feel.

4338
04:08:01,765 --> 04:08:04,205
We'll next Worshoot, and MediRoute, Apple.

4339
04:08:04,334 --> 04:08:07,074
It started playing with Apple. Now,

4340
04:08:07,789 --> 04:08:10,151
let me see if I can get some fun, if he's in there.

4341
04:08:10,152 --> 04:08:12,862
Yeah, I had 29,

4342
04:08:12,863 --> 04:08:15,942
450 from steel, and then 15,000,

4343
04:08:15,943 --> 04:08:18,079
150. Yep, he gave it a lot, so yeah.

4346
04:08:24,126 --> 04:08:26,231
31 bucks, 31 31 dollars.

4347
04:08:26,232 --> 04:08:28,588
I don't Some change. Whatever,

4348
04:08:28,651 --> 04:08:31,829

4349

4353
04:08:46,753 --> 04:08:48,907
make an F3, and pull it in at once for a higher level. we

4354
04:08:48,908 --> 04:08:51,566
will catch you for the, uh,

4355
04:08:51,577 --> 04:08:58,577
vlogs. That's what I'm going to show and

4356
04:08:58,578 --> 04:09:03,972
the people. Keep down

4357
04:09:03,973 --> 04:09:06,040
the question. Excited,

4358
04:09:06,041 --> 04:09:08,903
buddy, keep up. I said, why don't you? Oh,

4359
04:09:08,904 --> 04:09:11,777
no, respect. Atlassian,

4360
04:09:11,778 --> 04:09:12,998
why don't you? Eh? There.

4361
04:09:23,651 --> 04:09:28,250
and it's

4362
04:09:28,251 --> 04:09:30,545
the minute. Okay.

4363
04:09:31,455 --> 04:09:36,074
Join me. You This'll be weird,

4364
04:09:36,075 --> 04:09:38,600
it's gonna be in the package,

4365
04:09:38,601 --> 04:09:41,873
probably. Working on a person in question. And it is- You uhh,

4366
04:09:41,874 --> 04:09:45,179
uhh, uhh, hmmm. It's like an eraser of a fridge.

4367
04:09:45,180 --> 04:09:47,551
I just thought I could put a lot of ink in it in the

4368
04:09:47,552 --> 04:09:51,532
morning. Okay. I can't just find an interesting reward.

4369
04:09:52,300 --> 04:09:55,059
It's available at the same time. It'll be sure it's ready yet,

4370
04:09:55,060 --> 04:09:57,600
but it's my month. It's a pug, so it's not my month.

4371
04:09:57,601 --> 04:10:00,913
Uhh, uhm.

4372
04:10:00,945 --> 04:10:06,604
Bye-bye, music. See you. I

4373
04:10:06,605 --> 04:10:09,652
mean, 5th country is one of theest parts of the country in the country.

4374
04:10:09,687 --> 04:10:12,581
Yeah. I'm sure you will. You know,

4375
04:10:12,582 --> 04:10:15,044
she's wearing eyes. you and that,

4376
04:10:15,045 --> 04:10:17,347
I'm gonna say if I'm gonna need to, so they have a great bunch

4377
04:10:17,348 --> 04:10:19,549
of different uh, options to be gonna go.

4378
04:10:20,200 --> 04:10:22,220
Ok, so let's go work with them. Let me go.

4379
04:10:22,221 --> 04:10:24,367
I don't know. Well, uh,

4380
04:10:24,378 --> 04:10:26,815
well, it indicates what it meant to be. Well, there's some lines,

4381
04:10:26,885 --> 04:10:30,446
different ones. They're just kind of, they're actually gonna ask for you.

4382
04:10:30,447 --> 04:10:33,682
So I don't really do any more. Now,

4383
04:10:33,683 --> 04:10:35,254
I start with a market, and it's going to be a really good design.

4384
04:10:35,255 --> 04:10:37,805
You want to make a problem? John, John. I'm going you a bit of

4385
04:10:37,806 --> 04:10:40,084
the video. Yeah, do you want us to draw us?

4386
04:10:40,297 --> 04:10:44,953
Yeah, we should have a sample at any time. Which we

4387
04:10:44,954 --> 04:10:48,966
saw in the original video, at least we called, So, it's not,

4388
04:10:48,967 --> 04:10:51,568
it's not, it's not really what we didn't, uh, uh.

4389
04:10:51,578 --> 04:10:54,676
Sure, so, okay. Thank you. Thank you.

4390
04:11:02,656 --> 04:11:05,141
So, I mean, what else kind of what's here?

4391
04:11:06,500 --> 04:11:08,798
It longs that light, and it looks as well,

4392
04:11:08,799 --> 04:11:13,634
as well as then. And, I think we're turning into

4393
04:11:13,908 --> 04:11:16,469
a year-long pipeline. And so,

4394
04:11:16,470 --> 04:11:18,761
there we go. Jira,

4395
04:11:18,762 --> 04:11:21,957
but, you know, they said make it sound because they're probably in the same

4396
04:11:21,958 --> 04:11:24,404
with TJ's, uhm, so TJ isn't that stability.

4397
04:11:25,339 --> 04:11:28,479
So. That's all I Like, you know,

4398
04:11:28,480 --> 04:11:33,238
how do you look at that adventure? And somehow I don't have an adventure,

4399
04:11:33,915 --> 04:11:39,216
so we had an adventure. better. better. Stop.

4400
04:11:40,637 --> 04:11:42,885
Free. Better to solve.

4401
04:11:42,886 --> 04:11:46,448
All right. All right. All right. Okay. Let's see where all the effects are,

4402
04:11:46,449 --> 04:11:50,660
and then we're going to solve first.

4403
04:11:50,754 --> 04:11:52,914
So we do. I didn't want to keep all of my senses,

4404
04:11:53,000 --> 04:11:57,105
no. But what sucks is, inventors,

4405
04:11:57,372 --> 04:12:00,133
I don't care about it, so a lot of it all- I'm just like,

4406
04:12:00,134 --> 04:12:02,879
hey, we're auto-capped people. And so,

4407
04:12:02,880 --> 04:12:06,001
that became a problem, and commonly,

4408
04:12:06,239 --> 04:12:08,770
auto-capped license. Thank for your attention. So, to me, keep on going to the

4409
04:12:08,771 --> 04:12:11,031
rigidity. I mean, these licenses,

4410
04:12:11,137 --> 04:12:13,990
like, we are auto-starred. But,

4411
04:12:13,991 --> 04:12:16,533
I mean, if you want to do some- Brimes, like that,

4412
04:12:16,534 --> 04:12:18,682
by that. But, I mean,

4413
04:12:18,683 --> 04:12:21,248
Bitbucket is a whole, more solid,

4414
04:12:21,265 --> 04:12:25,263
it's a whole thing to mark, it's a thing. We'll be like,

4415
04:12:25,802 --> 04:12:29,307
I have a temperature for a little while, man. We need this,

4416
04:12:29,308 --> 04:12:32,415
uhm, this, uhm, this, uhm, this, I don't know if it is going to

4417
04:12:32,417 --> 04:12:35,593
cost a question, but I don't know what it, it's not like for the

4418
04:12:35,594 --> 04:12:38,706
way of designing that. And you're going to use it for the feel where

4419
04:12:38,793 --> 04:12:41,586
it appears. Yeah, we wanted to do it here for the shop,

4420
04:12:41,587 --> 04:12:43,935
and I was like, I think that'd be great for the night,

4421
04:12:43,939 --> 04:12:46,592
so I was like,

4422
04:12:46,593 --> 04:12:50,486
what can you draw here? Jira, Loom, MediRoute, because the bellows end up.

4423
04:12:50,974 --> 04:12:53,107
Oh, they actually draw it down. Yeah, they,

4424
04:12:53,108 --> 04:12:55,571
uh, who's going to come up? Go on and view it.

4425
04:12:55,572 --> 04:12:58,546
I'm going come up and show you how to do it. And Jimmy started

4426
04:12:58,547 --> 04:13:01,041
doing the, uh, um, um, with the bellows.

4427
04:13:01,042 --> 04:13:04,089
And I'm like, there's just, that's- Turdike,

4428
04:13:04,593 --> 04:13:06,772
you know, real time and impact, you know,

4429
04:13:06,773 --> 04:13:10,776
where your brilliant money is, it's, it won't process as close to getting rid

4430
04:13:10,777 --> 04:13:13,174
of you. So do you want to get rid of me?

4431
04:13:13,497 --> 04:13:15,520
Yeah. Sorry.

4432
04:13:16,056 --> 04:13:18,672
I was like, I'm tired for that either.

4433
04:13:18,673 --> 04:13:20,704
It's a lot. Bye bye. I'm just somebody,

4434
04:13:20,705 --> 04:13:23,482
you know, you know, a book? No.

4435
04:13:23,483 --> 04:13:26,296
It's like a website, right? You just go and job it's somebody,

4436
04:13:26,297 --> 04:13:28,517
you just like shit all the time. Contact.

4437
04:13:28,821 --> 04:13:31,831
And then, what we did was, um, for one of the buildings,

4438
04:13:31,832 --> 04:13:34,872
we did a demo of building scanner.

4439
04:13:35,293 --> 04:13:38,474
And so. you We're all walking and I'm doing a training mountain,

4440
04:13:38,475 --> 04:13:41,031
and they said, oh yeah, we'll send you the file for free.

4441
04:13:41,408 --> 04:13:43,699
You know, I'm a part of it. Just demo so that we can get

4442
04:13:43,700 --> 04:13:47,669
started. So we're going to start with our model.

4443
04:13:47,996 --> 04:13:49,553
And I'm still like, in charge of it. But I just want to do

4444
04:13:49,554 --> 04:13:54,998
this for a little bit. we're going You It's

4445
04:13:54,999 --> 04:13:57,355
definitely genius, all the rich and rich. I think it's very honest,

4446
04:13:57,356 --> 04:14:00,216
all the rest of that. Yeah, that's the generic. back. Yeah.

4447
04:14:00,904 --> 04:14:04,436
But I, I'm okay at 2000 or less than at home,

4448
04:14:04,437 --> 04:14:06,813
the company I work for, bottom. Thanks watching,

4449
04:14:06,814 --> 04:14:09,994
and I'll see you in this so I haven't had it,

4450
04:14:10,773 --> 04:14:13,190
had it forever now, but it's, it's one of you,

4451
04:14:13,191 --> 04:14:18,039
but. Good. Let me know how I start things with that software,

4452
04:14:18,040 --> 04:14:24,506
okay, I'll discuss this. Thank Listen,

4453
04:14:24,507 --> 04:14:27,140
they can't do you so good at it. Exactly. I hope you enjoyed

4454
04:14:32,051 --> 04:14:35,639
So we're gonna wait for the electrical should we do it again?

4455
04:14:35,640 --> 04:14:39,008
Hey, I don't have something to find.

4456
04:14:39,009 --> 04:14:41,615
Must be in there, it's all built. No. No. No. That's the one being

4457
04:14:41,616 --> 04:14:45,718
called. That's the side of the wheel.

4458
04:14:46,737 --> 04:14:49,096
Greatness. guys. In a calm,

4459
04:14:49,097 --> 04:14:54,045
dizzy, 12. I wanna be crazy with preference.

4460
04:14:54,046 --> 04:14:57,674
We'll see I to go round,

4461
04:14:57,675 --> 04:14:57,973
right?

4462
04:15:04,211 --> 04:15:06,375
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh,

4463
04:15:06,376 --> 04:15:11,184
heh, heh. I did just again on a

4464
04:15:11,185 --> 04:15:15,636
long idea. I'm going to do an estimate of,

4465
04:15:15,972 --> 04:15:18,075
I'm going to do 13th of the paper, I'm going to do 15th.

4466
04:15:18,076 --> 04:15:20,291
Thank you. Yeah.

4467
04:15:20,292 --> 04:15:22,520
Do a chance to buy a kit? Mmm,

4468
04:15:22,679 --> 04:15:24,838
not unless. It takes me, my own,

4469
04:15:24,839 --> 04:15:26,934
if you want to get into it. Yeah, that worked.

4470
04:15:27,712 --> 04:15:32,497
It was that way. with. Is that a boost

4471
04:15:32,498 --> 04:15:35,182
kit? No. No.

4472
04:15:35,183 --> 04:15:37,339
No. No. No. No. No. No.

4473
04:15:37,340 --> 04:15:41,926
No. No. Yeah,

4474
04:15:41,927 --> 04:15:44,776
I used to walk in and talk in terms of you guys.

4475
04:15:44,777 --> 04:15:48,995
Gays, Nettges, Pimparker,

4476
04:15:49,108 --> 04:15:51,139
London, England, I don't know what's going on.

4477
04:15:51,337 --> 04:15:54,030
There's Office, you know. So lets go. I just love them.

4478
04:15:54,979 --> 04:15:58,334
Like, ah, oops, oops,

4479
04:15:58,335 --> 04:16:00,791
No. Good. Good.

4480
04:16:00,792 --> 04:16:05,246
I don't know if it's being in a field site at the end of

4481
04:16:05,382 --> 04:16:13,124
the construction It's

4482
04:16:13,125 --> 04:16:14,535
our technology in that environment. This is I'll make

4483
04:16:18,731 --> 04:16:22,339
So that is forward, kind of forward because of the yesterday,

4484
04:16:22,340 --> 04:16:26,229
so that's what we are feeling now. I'm good.

4485
04:16:26,230 --> 04:16:28,521
Yeah. Good. Good. Thank you,

4486
04:16:28,522 --> 04:16:34,550
thank you. We'll you

4487
04:16:35,017 --> 04:16:38,323
in a Umm,

4488
04:16:38,334 --> 04:16:40,793
it is. I was not that impressed.

4489
04:16:41,196 --> 04:16:47,963
I just did a one here. I didn't even get I

4490
04:16:47,964 --> 04:16:49,280
mean, we're bad, it's like, I think thought it was gonna be fun to

4491
04:16:49,281 --> 04:16:52,559
hear, well, you know, you gotta remember, I've come from other places.

4492
04:16:52,560 --> 04:16:55,523
Thank you. I have all this really nice equipment and I hope,

4493
04:16:55,524 --> 04:16:57,778
uh, Space Girl,

4494
04:16:57,779 --> 04:17:00,492
you do that. Uh,

4495
04:17:00,503 --> 04:17:05,173
I'ma- I would purposely use a really good set of drawings to

4496
04:17:05,174 --> 04:17:08,495
kind of see what it can do, right? That's throwing up the most difficult.

4497
04:17:08,496 --> 04:17:13,220
It's called. So,

4498
04:17:13,221 --> 04:17:16,811
they've had this thing. They've had about 75 recorders on it.

4499
04:17:16,812 --> 04:17:20,329
for about the past six months, just as a,

4500
04:17:20,330 --> 04:17:22,763
uhm, in Mega Mode,

4501
04:17:23,259 --> 04:17:27,578
just to get things working. Welcome. So I'm gonna upload a set of drawings

4502
04:17:27,579 --> 04:17:30,561
here. Umm,

4503
04:17:30,572 --> 04:17:32,596
I'll just put in today's data.

4504
04:17:32,597 --> 04:17:34,754
is the project number.

4505
04:17:34,755 --> 04:17:39,767
Fill out whatever you want to there. So it's gonna upload the drawings.

4506
04:17:39,819 --> 04:17:42,047
Let me, actually, let me- I don't open that so you can kind of

4507
04:17:42,048 --> 04:17:44,254
see what I'm uploading. Umm.

4508
04:17:44,255 --> 04:17:44,860
.

4509
04:17:49,031 --> 04:17:51,126
Uhh, duh duh.

4510
04:17:51,127 --> 04:17:51,217
Thank you.

4511
04:17:57,071 --> 04:18:02,807
So this is what I'm up on just,

4512
04:18:02,808 --> 04:18:05,111
you know, just PDFs, yep.

4513
04:18:05,112 --> 04:18:07,933
And what's good, what's this program going to do?

4514
04:18:08,409 --> 04:18:10,831
It's going to, so.

4515
04:18:10,832 --> 04:18:13,156
I love it.

4516
04:18:13,157 --> 04:18:16,273
Once again, it's up there, I've done it in the last few years.

4517
04:18:16,436 --> 04:18:19,847
Yeah. They'll take off the columns, they'll take off the beams,

4518
04:18:19,848 --> 04:18:23,890
they'll engineer the connection. It'll spin out the next more to,

4519
04:18:24,142 --> 04:18:27,324
to bring in the power time, and it can reveal the model,

4520
04:18:27,672 --> 04:18:29,697
calling them shy. Bye-bye. Wow.

4521
04:18:29,724 --> 04:18:33,021
Yeah. A lot of the tech folks have said for you,

4522
04:18:33,022 --> 04:18:36,414
impressive. It's crazy.

4523
04:18:36,933 --> 04:18:39,078
It's, Alright,

4524
04:18:39,079 --> 04:18:41,584
so I'm in there. Let me go here first. This configuration.

4525
04:18:41,585 --> 04:18:43,855
The duration of all the planets in section.

4526
04:18:43,994 --> 04:18:47,284
I don't think no other plan. No,

4527
04:18:47,285 --> 04:18:51,101
it's, it's, you, you don't have to upload everything,

4528
04:18:51,102 --> 04:18:54,189
like, this page is going to do not. Thank much for Alright?

4529
04:18:54,272 --> 04:18:57,653
Sure. Uhm, but even with the sections,

4530
04:18:57,654 --> 04:19:00,447
it's not gonna really look at the sections right now.

4531
04:19:00,448 --> 04:19:04,430
There, there. Okay. It's actually working on it where it will start using the

4532
04:19:04,431 --> 04:19:09,009
sections to get more detail and to get other information.

4533
04:19:09,010 --> 04:19:12,098
It's But. I pretty much, these are all the pages I care about.

4534
04:19:12,308 --> 04:19:16,730
So, now, I can write here on this config page.

4535
04:19:16,847 --> 04:19:21,166
Yes, You would want to get in here and look and do all your

4536
04:19:21,175 --> 04:19:23,591
settings for how you wanted the deep connections.

4537
04:19:23,592 --> 04:19:27,041
Umm, the B-M-N-N and Reaction Method,

4538
04:19:27,042 --> 04:19:29,765
Seismic Stuff. Umm,

4539
04:19:29,776 --> 04:19:33,215
do I want to default to double angles or shoot hands?

4540
04:19:33,216 --> 04:19:37,277
Yeah, I'm sorry. Right? So, you set all this up in order to do

4541
04:19:37,278 --> 04:19:41,105
the connections. Does it actually understand your excitement?

4542
04:19:41,106 --> 04:19:43,203
Have a good one. I'm not,

4543
04:19:43,204 --> 04:19:46,634
I don't know that I don't fully, it's going to be quite honest with

4544
04:19:46,635 --> 04:19:48,644
you. I, I haven't, you know,

4545
04:19:48,645 --> 04:19:50,926
I've used a simple. Dutshill, it's, it's,

4546
04:19:51,588 --> 04:19:53,608
so I, I don't know all those announcements,

4547
04:19:53,609 --> 04:19:56,183
you have to get them. I have to ask them about that,

4548
04:19:56,184 --> 04:20:00,145
but. So. So, What I'm going to do on,

4549
04:20:00,560 --> 04:20:03,002
so I'm a foundation plan, so.

4550
04:20:03,759 --> 04:20:06,494
What I'm going to do, it picks up the- Scale,

4551
04:20:06,495 --> 04:20:08,638
and the, um, well,

4552
04:20:08,639 --> 04:20:11,239
give him pick up top of steel, cause there is no top of steel,

4553
04:20:11,240 --> 04:20:13,751
alright? So, I can do zero.

4554
04:20:13,752 --> 04:20:15,862
I could do minus one for that.

4555
04:20:15,863 --> 04:20:18,611
I could do whatever I wanted to there for,

4556
04:20:18,626 --> 04:20:22,804
for this and then I'm gonna tell it by hitting this button to go

4557
04:20:22,805 --> 04:20:25,679
analyze it. So now you'll see that,

4558
04:20:25,825 --> 04:20:27,982
like on this one, you'll see it,

4559
04:20:28,160 --> 04:20:30,373
it'll pick it up here. ... second,

4560
04:20:30,600 --> 04:20:35,032
see how it is now highlighted in blue and has that overlay on it.

4561
04:20:35,399 --> 04:20:37,524
At that point, I'm just making sure it got everything.

4562
04:20:37,525 --> 04:20:40,588
I love you, too. and make sure it get and get something that I

4563
04:20:40,589 --> 04:20:44,047
don't want like this over here. It picked up stuff here,

4564
04:20:44,048 --> 04:20:46,243
which I don't want, so I'm just going to holla Thank you. like that

4565
04:20:46,244 --> 04:20:49,607
and say, don't, don't do that until it will read me a little bit

4566
04:20:49,608 --> 04:20:51,699
with that, with that out of it.

4567
04:20:51,716 --> 04:20:54,005
So, you're pretty.

4568
04:20:53,877 --> 04:20:56,983
Pretty much just letting it do its thing to make sure it got everything

4569
04:20:56,984 --> 04:20:59,213
and cleaning it up. Now,

4570
04:20:59,665 --> 04:21:01,991
I'm gonna then go to the next set.

4571
04:21:01,992 --> 04:21:04,816
It picked up top of steel, it picked up my scale.

4572
04:21:05,211 --> 04:21:07,424
So I'm just gonna tell it to you go.

4573
04:21:07,425 --> 04:21:11,118
Hello. And boom,

4574
04:21:11,119 --> 04:21:15,480
it got all that. You can see the red though it didn't pick up

4575
04:21:15,481 --> 04:21:18,076
like if I zoom in here. You're,

4576
04:21:18,077 --> 04:21:20,491
It didn't get this one here,

4577
04:21:20,492 --> 04:21:24,490
this 10 at 12. And it didn't get this 10 at 12 right here,

4578
04:21:24,491 --> 04:21:29,240
so if I were to select both of them, I can then

4579
04:21:29,241 --> 04:21:32,900
tell it it's a dead, oops, W10x12.

4580
04:21:32,621 --> 04:21:37,473
So And that has six studs.

4581
04:21:38,176 --> 04:21:42,015
It is picking up the studs by the way. So I'm safe.

4582
04:21:42,016 --> 04:21:44,487
Thank I've been telling it to re-deal.

4583
04:21:44,607 --> 04:21:47,426
So really, I've just cleaned it up, right? Like I picked up all this

4584
04:21:47,427 --> 04:21:50,236
crap right here thinking it's a beam of some sort. Work.

4585
04:21:50,237 --> 04:21:52,557
So I would just be going through cleaning all that up.

4586
04:21:53,460 --> 04:21:55,941
I'll go to the next page. Same deal.

4587
04:21:55,942 --> 04:21:58,585
Picked up top of steel and my scale. I was t- I love the

4588
04:21:58,586 --> 04:22:03,464
screen. I see you're going

4589
04:22:03,465 --> 04:22:05,788
floor by elevation, elevation,

4590
04:22:05,789 --> 04:22:11,831
current. with it. So,

4591
04:22:11,832 --> 04:22:13,903
yeah, I haven't really cleaned up anything,

4592
04:22:13,904 --> 04:22:16,639
right? All right. But just a few, a few things.

4593
04:22:16,893 --> 04:22:20,541
But as I'm doing that, I go here to my 3D view.

4594
04:22:21,734 --> 04:22:28,986
You're gonna see this. This is where

4595
04:22:28,987 --> 04:22:32,307
I think my- Modeling is going to be a,

4596
04:22:32,308 --> 04:22:34,707
uh, think of the past before too long.

4597
04:22:34,708 --> 04:22:40,938
All right. And

4598
04:22:40,939 --> 04:22:43,881
so now I've got my model with connections in it.

4599
04:22:43,882 --> 04:22:49,595
Live. Hm.

4600
04:22:49,596 --> 04:22:51,696
Interesting. And that crazy? Yeah, it is. Keep watching.

4601
04:22:51,697 --> 04:22:53,820
Now, we'll be right All right.

4602
04:22:55,871 --> 04:22:58,011
Absolutely. So,

4603
04:22:58,539 --> 04:23:02,383
I got my model. I can come over here.

4604
04:23:02,879 --> 04:23:07,200
You see that building? on the material. This is actually the,

4605
04:23:08,096 --> 04:23:12,817
the import, um, template. I'm with So you

4606
04:23:12,818 --> 04:23:15,076
can see that it's,

4607
04:23:15,090 --> 04:23:18,996
it's picked up my quantity, my shape, my size. Don't more videos.

4608
04:23:19,544 --> 04:23:23,494
Thank for watching. I think the grade, it's got my labor code in here.

4609
04:23:23,495 --> 04:23:27,911
They're working on this being customizable to your own labor code.

4610
04:23:27,912 --> 04:23:32,379
Alright, so if you want, it got camber coat,

4611
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:36,776
coals, studs, and it's just- I'm just picking up a I've got up everything,

4612
04:23:36,777 --> 04:23:42,450
right? I'm good at PDFs, I'm good. Um.

4613
04:23:42,460 --> 04:23:45,743
They were fine. I'm in love. Oh, whole lot.

4614
04:23:45,744 --> 04:23:46,804
We can get that in one of them. We don't want to throw it

4615
04:23:46,805 --> 04:23:50,686
up here. But that's one thing they want to know is staff are getting

4616
04:23:50,687 --> 04:23:53,116
someone there for one of their lives. And get along there.

4617
04:23:53,117 --> 04:23:59,743
It's free. Yeah. Yeah. That was good. I mean. I'm to make

4618
04:23:59,744 --> 04:24:04,639
it Now, got it. I can come here also with my columns.

4619
04:24:04,640 --> 04:24:07,936
You see that it thought that I'll go back up.

4620
04:24:12,297 --> 04:24:14,179
It thought that on the upper level it was a 14 to 74 minutes,

4621
04:24:14,180 --> 04:24:20,062
a 14 to 68 actually. actually. So

4622
04:24:20,063 --> 04:24:24,612
what it I'll get rid of

4623
04:24:24,613 --> 04:24:27,043
it. So now I've got that fixed.

4624
04:24:27,044 --> 04:24:29,515
So you want to check your column schedule here. But like,

4625
04:24:29,647 --> 04:24:31,863
if I literally did want a column splice here,

4626
04:24:31,864 --> 04:24:35,384
I- I can do that, and then choose whether I want it to be

4627
04:24:35,385 --> 04:24:39,117
welded or bolted or what type of connect splice I want there,

4628
04:24:39,205 --> 04:24:41,216
right? But. I can build. You're a starter?

4629
04:24:42,009 --> 04:24:44,556
No, this was a plywood mine.

4630
04:24:44,557 --> 04:24:47,371
Um, so it's a fabricator that wrote this,

4631
04:24:47,372 --> 04:24:50,088
which is a nut. . Another big checkbox, right? That's a good thing.

4632
04:24:50,089 --> 04:24:52,251
Uh, a fabricator it is.

4633
04:24:52,315 --> 04:24:55,772
So, this is pretty awesome.

4634
04:24:55,773 --> 04:24:59,804
and then I can also,

4635
04:24:59,891 --> 04:25:02,921
right here, they're going to get it set on the apply that.

4636
04:25:02,922 --> 04:25:06,842
That's it. They're going to get it set where the bracing just,

4637
04:25:07,262 --> 04:25:09,444
it figures the bracing out and does it.

4638
04:25:10,035 --> 04:25:12,490
If I get a brace as though, I can- I'm going to open my

4639
04:25:12,491 --> 04:25:17,172
bracing in here if I wanted to, by saying I started column C1,

4640
04:25:17,173 --> 04:25:19,991
get a column C32. I'll you in the next video.

4641
04:25:19,992 --> 04:25:22,686
I want the bracing,

4642
04:25:22,787 --> 04:25:25,042
I want it to be welded and cool,

4643
04:25:25,208 --> 04:25:27,249
and I want it to be HSS,

4644
04:25:27,250 --> 04:25:29,700
I I made by,

4645
04:25:29,701 --> 04:25:34,478
oh, uh quarter. Waaac

4646
04:25:34,479 --> 04:25:38,267
Chr! Fricked out on me. Thank you. Oh,

4647
04:25:38,268 --> 04:25:42,169
man.

4648
04:25:42,170 --> 04:25:46,357
You're bad. I'll see you Something freaked out on me.

4649
04:25:46,548 --> 04:25:48,831
Let me get back in there. But I can,

4650
04:25:48,832 --> 04:25:51,177
I can build my mercy if I wanted to.

4651
04:25:51,848 --> 04:25:54,625
Then once I get on- All that done, and I had the model.

4652
04:25:54,626 --> 04:25:57,154
I could import the model. I could also,

4653
04:25:57,348 --> 04:26:00,062
by getting the IFC right there,

4654
04:26:00,513 --> 04:26:03,273
there be- I don't think it's so that it can go straight into technical

4655
04:26:03,274 --> 04:26:05,280
structure, your history as well.

4656
04:26:05,754 --> 04:26:08,956
And just build the bottle in there. But I can also do this.

4657
04:26:08,801 --> 04:26:15,311
This export is PDF. And it

4658
04:26:15,312 --> 04:26:18,994
marks up everything that, Took off now and got to do the rest of

4659
04:26:18,995 --> 04:26:21,271
the jump, you know, the genobrist,

4660
04:26:21,272 --> 04:26:23,494
uh, all the perimeter stuff,

4661
04:26:23,495 --> 04:26:26,521
my miscellaneous and everything. So, I mean,

4662
04:26:26,522 --> 04:26:28,753
yeah, you think about it.

4663
04:26:28,754 --> 04:26:30,969
I mean, how, how much savings is,

4664
04:26:30,970 --> 04:26:35,236
is that if it's picking up the drop? So, I know how to write.

4665
04:26:35,237 --> 04:26:37,745
I've got, uh, one part of Texas,

4666
04:26:37,746 --> 04:26:41,384
who was, if you go to, um. and see you Ah,

4667
04:26:41,385 --> 04:26:44,055
what's your name? The other guy's here,

4668
04:26:44,567 --> 04:26:47,776
Lyft. If you go to these guys' website,

4669
04:26:48,214 --> 04:26:50,350
you're gonna see- the, uh, sketch deck.

4670
04:26:50,649 --> 04:26:53,877
You're gonna see one of our clients and biggest user on it.

4671
04:26:54,410 --> 04:26:56,487
They've switched over to his. Umm,

4672
04:26:56,488 --> 04:27:01,248
uhm. Oh, my God. He, he says that he's getting about only

4673
04:27:01,249 --> 04:27:03,397
percent more estimates out what it is.

4674
04:27:03,535 --> 04:27:05,742
We'll have the same people. you I mean,

4675
04:27:05,880 --> 04:27:08,011
they're strict structuring. Yeah,

4676
04:27:08,012 --> 04:27:11,187
industrial grounds don't even, you know,

4677
04:27:11,345 --> 04:27:15,717
like, uh, strict structuring. Okay, so that's what this is going to look like.

4678
04:27:15,718 --> 04:27:17,785
Look at the strategy of what you have in your strategy.

4679
04:27:17,786 --> 04:27:20,466
We're fine. 10%.

4680
04:27:20,467 --> 04:27:23,935
10 10%?

4681
04:27:23,936 --> 04:27:26,248
10%?

4682
04:27:26,249 --> 04:27:28,561
10%?

4683
04:27:28,562 --> 04:27:30,837
10% of the dynamics?

4684
04:27:30,838 --> 04:27:35,022
Thanks. We'll see if I can ask a question this one.

4685
04:27:35,464 --> 04:27:37,379
How many yes, I'm just going to do the restraints function. I'll see you

4686
04:27:37,380 --> 04:27:46,133
in Yeah,

4687
04:27:46,134 --> 04:27:47,684
well, I mean, we can throw some airplanes up here. Hi! That's it! Well,

4688
04:27:47,685 --> 04:27:49,761
great day. I you enjoyed. You all What? Let me read the right thing.

4689
04:27:49,947 --> 04:27:52,051
I don't care if you use it now. I didn't have to really do

4690
04:27:52,052 --> 04:27:54,125
it. I just like sharing the tools, uh.

4691
04:27:54,135 --> 04:27:56,667
I don't even back up, see if it'll be back up. It's for the

4692
04:27:56,668 --> 04:27:58,676
needle of how, uh,

4693
04:27:58,686 --> 04:28:02,021
you know how much it's going to be. It's,

4694
04:28:02,022 --> 04:28:04,435
uh, nearly sound edgy. anymore. First.

4695
04:28:05,264 --> 04:28:08,941
So, like right now that we talked two months ago,

4696
04:28:08,942 --> 04:28:11,524
you'd be able to do this for free. Uh,

4697
04:28:11,535 --> 04:28:13,850
as long as you- But, yeah,

4698
04:28:13,851 --> 04:28:16,152
conjugate a recursion. It's, uh,

4699
04:28:16,163 --> 04:28:18,178
they're not taking any more data control, sir. But I'm not doing the cost.

4700
04:28:18,179 --> 04:28:21,837
All the guests, ladies They know what sketch they're past,

4701
04:28:22,587 --> 04:28:25,342
so I would imagine it's going to be a really short sketch they've used,

4702
04:28:25,453 --> 04:28:29,336
so. Yeah. We'll see you which was pretty expensive,

4703
04:28:29,337 --> 04:28:32,263
but, yeah, it was pretty expensive,

4704
04:28:32,264 --> 04:28:36,746
80,000 off. I've heard all of them in the place for s- catch back.

4705
04:28:36,747 --> 04:28:39,974
Uhm.

4706
04:28:39,985 --> 04:28:43,618
They were included in the red to be based on a lot of kind

4707
04:28:43,619 --> 04:28:46,931
of like, well, then they stopped that and they started doing it part of

4708
04:28:46,932 --> 04:28:49,820
life since then they started doing it part company,

4709
04:28:50,020 --> 04:28:53,495
then they started doing it part yesterday. I don't know how you're going to

4710
04:28:53,496 --> 04:28:56,848
be planning on this soon, but it was pretty expensive.

4711
04:28:56,849 --> 04:29:01,544
Thank so much. I also

4712
04:29:01,545 --> 04:29:04,439
knew the $20 dollar exchange, well, I said you should go in that way.

4713
04:29:04,440 --> 04:29:09,205
But, erm, no, I don't know

4714
04:29:09,206 --> 04:29:12,584
that. I'm going to see if it's cheap, probably the most in the subscription.

4715
04:29:12,682 --> 04:29:16,456
You know, even what likes that over there.

4716
04:29:16,457 --> 04:29:18,953
But,

4717
04:29:18,954 --> 04:29:21,244
I guess my father was flexed in 25,000,

4718
04:29:21,245 --> 04:29:23,035
and I don't know if he could have a poor ship or a ship

4719
04:29:23,195 --> 04:29:26,386
ship or a or a I'd be all over. But,

4720
04:29:26,387 --> 04:29:30,361
ship, three of you guys from others you hear that this is a 25k,

4721
04:29:30,362 --> 04:29:32,440
it's done. Yes, but- .

4722
04:29:32,441 --> 04:29:34,503
. . ...the credit cards together. Yeah. And I'm- .

4723
04:29:34,504 --> 04:29:37,910
. . I'm tossing my number, like, the board of the people,

4724
04:29:37,911 --> 04:29:40,061
but the kids, the way this,

4725
04:29:40,280 --> 04:29:42,255
this- . . . people will stay a hundred- . . . got from,

4726
04:29:42,256 --> 04:29:44,742
like, a hundred- . . . that came in,

4727
04:29:44,791 --> 04:29:47,480
and he started detailed, but, like, he's got a program.

4728
04:29:47,481 --> 04:29:52,439
We'll back around and leave you. He

4729
04:29:52,440 --> 04:29:56,651
started working a little bit,

4730
04:29:56,652 --> 04:30:01,566
He just, he any guy that sold his buddies from back how the third-grampers,

4731
04:30:01,567 --> 04:30:03,758
uh, start helping them all out,

4732
04:30:03,759 --> 04:30:06,808
so they've been working a little bit. Thank you about two years. So,

4733
04:30:07,233 --> 04:30:11,126
yeah, it's been actively used in their shop citizens.

4734
04:30:11,127 --> 04:30:14,102
So, it's been fun. One. Yeah,

4735
04:30:14,409 --> 04:30:16,724
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,

4736
04:30:17,352 --> 04:30:19,888
yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cool content, bro. Yeah. Cool. Almost another. Learn more

4737
04:30:19,889 --> 04:30:23,030
at www And I've got sketch deck.

4738
04:30:23,043 --> 04:30:25,404
I haven't tried them in forever.

4739
04:30:25,405 --> 04:30:31,103
forever. I

4740
04:30:31,104 --> 04:30:33,117
could throw one out there too, but there's,

4741
04:30:33,536 --> 04:30:39,313
it doesn't do as much. Thank you. you So,

4742
04:30:39,314 --> 04:30:41,833
didn't I?

4743
04:30:41,834 --> 04:30:44,892
Do I call?

4744
04:30:44,893 --> 04:30:47,167
No. Mhm.

4745
04:30:47,168 --> 04:30:57,481
Mm hmm. I

4746
04:30:57,482 --> 04:31:00,765
would be just a child of the girls later. Let's see how much.

4747
04:31:00,766 --> 04:31:02,967
So, on. Go on. We'll go on. David Rastikz. I've done some and it's

4748
04:31:02,968 --> 04:31:05,409
like, okay, well, uh,

4749
04:31:05,420 --> 04:31:08,198
ah, so. And they've had slowly.

4750
04:31:08,199 --> 04:31:11,151
I believe. The estimators don't hear like that.

4751
04:31:12,324 --> 04:31:15,161
I've, I've done it. They had them fixed much of that.

4752
04:31:15,203 --> 04:31:17,959
Like I said, drones, I'll put up there. Thank you. For a client,

4753
04:31:17,960 --> 04:31:20,900
and it didn't really need anything. And it, it should have been so I

4754
04:31:20,901 --> 04:31:22,956
sent it to him that night. I came up back here. He said,

4755
04:31:22,957 --> 04:31:25,156
okay, good shot, Mill. I picked up everything.

4756
04:31:25,157 --> 04:31:28,363
So, I was kind of pleased with their response here.

4757
04:31:28,364 --> 04:31:30,393
By their crowdsourced data conditioning, that's not much of their performance.

4758
04:31:30,394 --> 04:31:32,760
Don't worry Don't worry.

4759
04:31:32,761 --> 04:31:35,966
There'sangers to work Yeah. Exactly. When I saw it,

4760
04:31:36,544 --> 04:31:39,011
I'm about to go. Like, as you guys said,

4761
04:31:39,012 --> 04:31:41,037
it's now. They're like, it's not really. And like,

4762
04:31:41,038 --> 04:31:44,151
you're way farther than anybody else. Just tell everybody what it came to,

4763
04:31:44,152 --> 04:31:46,454
what it came to, what to, what what it just was selling.

4764
04:31:46,455 --> 04:31:48,920
And they're like, where I'm going to tell us how it's ready.

4765
04:31:48,921 --> 04:31:51,502
. S My okay. But.

4766
04:31:51,857 --> 04:31:54,868
There he is, there he is.

4767
04:31:54,869 --> 04:31:55,524
I want

4768
04:32:14,051 --> 04:32:17,804
Alright.

4769
04:32:17,805 --> 04:32:38,253
. I

4770
04:32:38,254 --> 04:33:52,665
can't even hear you serious, I'll get- Or

4771
04:33:52,666 --> 04:33:57,600
the other side of their own. . . I don't think

4772
04:33:57,601 --> 04:34:01,871
they got anywhere to get to.

4773
04:34:01,872 --> 04:34:07,575
I'm sure

4774
04:34:07,576 --> 04:34:08,363
that we all want to start sailing into it. Yeah, I hope that they

4775
04:34:08,388 --> 04:34:09,527
already had. Good.

4776
04:34:17,951 --> 04:34:18,750
Ojib. Thank you.

4777
04:35:07,211 --> 04:35:12,211
Subscribe

4778
04:35:13,503 --> 04:35:16,833
to our internet, not heaven. Bye-bye. Yeah,

4779
04:35:16,834 --> 04:35:19,712
that was the key. Yeah,

4780
04:35:19,713 --> 04:35:22,954
there are interesting videos, cool. That's what you've got to show,

4781
04:35:22,985 --> 04:35:24,936
right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

4782
04:35:29,950 --> 04:35:32,231
This is so the drums, I'm looking at it right here.

4783
04:35:32,097 --> 04:35:37,452
Here has, umm.

4784
04:35:37,463 --> 04:35:39,482
Atlassian where the building is. Yeah,

4785
04:35:41,075 --> 04:35:43,692
Yeah. You got half the building on this one, she got half the building

4786
04:35:43,714 --> 04:35:46,390
on this other sheet, and so now that's the part of those two together

4787
04:35:46,391 --> 04:35:49,034
somehow. We're having trouble with that first but- And the short.

4788
04:35:49,035 --> 04:35:54,915
All right. Hey, they got that taken care of everybody Yes,

4789
04:35:54,916 --> 04:35:57,251
go over to the end of the video.

4790
04:35:57,252 --> 04:36:00,010
And, uh, this is what we really just need.

4791
04:36:00,011 --> 04:36:05,040
Let me take a peek at this. Coming at our

4792
04:36:05,041 --> 04:36:07,567
agenda versus. Jesus. Give us an instantly.

4793
04:36:08,194 --> 04:36:08,750
Yep. So,

4794
04:36:38,651 --> 04:36:42,745
There is a way also to uh,

4795
04:36:42,756 --> 04:36:48,637
action draw stuff over here if you want me to. I'll see you I

4796
04:36:48,638 --> 04:36:50,673
don't have a big hat for someone. Good

4797
04:37:02,771 --> 04:37:04,806
I mean, it's called the enemy.

4798
04:37:04,807 --> 04:37:09,494
Uhh.

4799
04:37:09,505 --> 04:37:14,079
You made the coupling of notes, still, really? Baby. Master Steel is the,

4800
04:37:15,036 --> 04:37:19,271
is the steel company, but they kind of formed their own company.

4801
04:37:19,272 --> 04:37:20,480
I need to sell this. .

4802
04:37:37,271 --> 04:37:41,867
So there is a

4803
04:37:41,868 --> 04:37:45,929
company called D&D that does conceptual models.

4804
04:37:45,930 --> 04:37:49,107
All right. So, hopefully you know what, I know that I'm going to ask

4805
04:37:49,108 --> 04:37:57,113
us what's through instruction. Hello. Hello. It's,

4806
04:37:57,114 --> 04:37:59,827
uhm, Captain Lewis, OpsGenie.

4807
04:37:59,942 --> 04:38:04,117
Thank Well,

4808
04:38:04,118 --> 04:38:07,727
I think my search for Steel Genie.

4809
04:38:07,989 --> 04:38:12,795
Yep. This came up. you There is another,

4810
04:38:12,796 --> 04:38:17,306
uh, I'm trying to think of a name. There's another one that I have,

4811
04:38:17,307 --> 04:38:22,113
uh, a long year. I'm trying

4812
04:38:22,114 --> 04:38:27,196
to think of the name

4813
04:38:27,197 --> 04:38:29,867
. . . But it's just, ah,

4814
04:38:29,868 --> 04:38:34,008
it's a little bit frustrating, isn't it? You have little drones on their side.

4815
04:38:34,619 --> 04:38:38,845
They did the- They did the take-off on their software to send it back

4816
04:38:38,846 --> 04:38:40,886
to you. You have no control over it. So.

4817
04:38:41,048 --> 04:38:43,271
Sutter.

4818
04:38:43,272 --> 04:38:47,993
It's, it's all good. Don't be a little bit frustrated because I don't,

4819
04:38:48,077 --> 04:38:50,540
if I'm gonna give you a little help, pick out everything,

4820
04:38:50,901 --> 04:38:53,663
make no- the type of the insublier.

4821
04:38:54,768 --> 04:38:57,850
Kinda weird that in a,

4822
04:38:58,379 --> 04:38:59,351
you should be- You

4823
04:39:07,391 --> 04:39:10,438
It's like nothing about contact information,

4824
04:39:10,439 --> 04:39:12,154
anything that you may discuss in the video. No.

4825
04:40:39,851 --> 04:40:42,404
Hopefully not, but guys, don't come.

4826
04:40:42,405 --> 04:40:44,766
I don't know what we're doing, what are we doing, tough love.

4827
04:40:44,767 --> 04:40:47,891
Umm, I don't see the importance towards that.

4828
04:40:47,892 --> 04:40:52,753
I just want to do for all these truck

4829
04:40:52,754 --> 04:40:55,931
eases. Yeah, I can cause- Oh my gosh.

4830
04:40:55,932 --> 04:40:59,865
I can't even scroll here. Uhh,

4831
04:40:59,876 --> 04:41:01,993
this is fun, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm,

4832
04:41:01,994 --> 04:41:04,312
uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm. Come here,

4833
04:41:04,313 --> 04:41:07,308
go back out there and leave the link in there.

4834
04:41:07,309 --> 04:41:09,441
Umm,

4835
04:41:09,452 --> 04:41:14,154
I will just call them shamelessly. So now, you got an import

4836
04:41:14,155 --> 04:41:16,948
on the electrical studs, that's what you say. Please.

4837
04:41:16,949 --> 04:41:19,763
I'm pleased. Okay. Amen.

4838
04:41:19,764 --> 04:41:22,972
Good. Okay. Okay. Everybody go on in like this.

4839
04:41:22,973 --> 04:41:25,409
All the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good.

4840
04:41:25,410 --> 04:41:28,181
We'll see you Yeah,

4841
04:41:28,182 --> 04:41:30,437
I was just, I was just beep out about it going.

4842
04:41:30,991 --> 04:41:33,679
Oh, man. Yeah, that, we,

4843
04:41:33,720 --> 04:41:36,136
we helped him with estimating. They're wanting to help.

4844
04:41:36,137 --> 04:41:40,641
But, they're wanting to help with production because they're almost It's a good

4845
04:41:40,642 --> 04:41:42,719
minute and it's great in the hair, it's a bit challenging,

4846
04:41:42,946 --> 04:41:47,146
but it's great in the hair. It's a bit challenging in the new structure

4847
04:41:47,147 --> 04:41:49,519
of them, in the new creates, and they do all right now.

4848
04:41:50,221 --> 04:41:54,786
Don't let anything go the other way. Thanks a

4849
04:41:54,787 --> 04:41:57,891
lot. Start with the structure of the vision about,

4850
04:41:58,452 --> 04:42:00,997
about a better scale. Thank you. There's,

4851
04:42:00,998 --> 04:42:03,567
uh,

4852
04:42:03,578 --> 04:42:07,768
a lot of other companies out there I haven't done anything with I've done

4853
04:42:07,769 --> 04:42:10,295
to. Good. Good. Hm. For some busy,

4854
04:42:10,296 --> 04:42:15,542
uh, but, yeah. Everything

4855
04:42:15,543 --> 04:42:16,331
booked out. Go!

4856
04:42:20,843 --> 04:42:24,280
Yeah, booked out. In the April right now. Yeah. Yeah.

4857
04:42:24,281 --> 04:42:28,999
Thank you. But

4858
04:42:29,000 --> 04:42:31,214
that's, umm,

4859
04:42:31,225 --> 04:42:33,436
I'm planning one week a month not.

4860
04:42:33,437 --> 04:42:37,962
Traveling, so that's a little bit

4861
04:42:37,963 --> 04:42:40,662
artificially inflated from what I used to be.

4862
04:42:40,830 --> 04:42:43,048
See you later. On the road? Yes.

4863
04:42:44,038 --> 04:42:46,361
How many people do you have, like, Jason,

4864
04:42:46,362 --> 04:42:49,088
to the same community? Uh,

4865
04:42:49,099 --> 04:42:51,809
what other, I've got other than yours. Some rich markets.

4866
04:42:55,090 --> 04:42:57,614
Yeah. Two. Oh, there's probably so many structural shops,

4867
04:42:57,615 --> 04:43:00,282
so it's just there. You are trending. They are posted in Lava,

4868
04:43:00,508 --> 04:43:03,340
out there in, uh, in the U.S.

4869
04:43:03,502 --> 04:43:07,577
Yeah. They they have, they they have. We'll see the next hundred thirty at

4870
04:43:07,578 --> 04:43:11,005
three. I found like eighty seven.

4871
04:43:11,006 --> 04:43:13,026
I was looking like the rest of the pie. Yeah.

4872
04:43:13,027 --> 04:43:15,584
I found eighty seven. Thank much. Last. Yeah.

4873
04:43:15,585 --> 04:43:17,800
Not even, not including Kellogg from one year,

4874
04:43:17,801 --> 04:43:22,333
not including the cost. Yeah, thanks. Most of the pie is starting

4875
04:43:22,334 --> 04:43:25,020
to- Most of clients, I don't know why,

4876
04:43:25,021 --> 04:43:29,718
but maybe there's more family theaters, but most of my clients are

4877
04:43:29,719 --> 04:43:31,785
Easter-sized. So, I'm in the United States,

4878
04:43:32,190 --> 04:43:35,935
more southern western, which I will,

4879
04:43:35,936 --> 04:43:38,471
I will wish, yes.

4880
04:43:38,472 --> 04:43:43,290
Umm, like, there's all of the green dots

4881
04:43:43,291 --> 04:43:45,914
on the clients, but you need to say that,

4882
04:43:45,915 --> 04:43:48,737
uhm. Oh. I'm tired of concentration over the middle of that.

4883
04:43:48,738 --> 04:43:52,131
It means that's a little less, uh, for what to agree with about any

4884
04:43:52,132 --> 04:43:54,496
title matters. My culture, my aim is to,

4885
04:43:54,497 --> 04:43:57,084
Yeah. I know that you're an audience. Yeah.

4886
04:43:57,629 --> 04:43:59,951
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we're fun,

4887
04:43:59,952 --> 04:44:02,060
nice to know that you know we're looking for a job. I'm sorry.

4888
04:44:02,061 --> 04:44:04,891
I'm sorry. Let me know. Ops.

4889
04:44:04,892 --> 04:44:07,445
Uh. I got a chance down here,

4890
04:44:07,446 --> 04:44:11,755
down, and then we bring the house rather than just This is my So

4891
04:44:11,756 --> 04:44:15,049
yeah, I'm going to, like, bring it down to the sales stock,

4892
04:44:15,050 --> 04:44:17,798
bring it down to the, the interest rate of stock,

4893
04:44:17,799 --> 04:44:20,389
which, eh, that. I think I might have bound one today, so,

4894
04:44:20,390 --> 04:44:24,787
uh, to figure out, this is what I like to run out of,

4895
04:44:24,788 --> 04:44:32,331
like, to say. Good. Yeah.

4896
04:44:33,260 --> 04:44:38,072
Wait a few minutes of the sun here. We'll see in the next

4897
04:44:38,073 --> 04:44:42,978
video. I like to feel like I'm helping

4898
04:44:42,979 --> 04:44:46,605
you now. Yeah, that's the biggest issue you can make with work.

4899
04:44:47,614 --> 04:44:51,556
The last 10 years, that's the biggest issue.

4900
04:44:51,557 --> 04:44:54,006
Yeah,

4901
04:44:54,007 --> 04:44:55,200
I think my goes to this five to five thing. I was hearing all

4902
04:44:55,201 --> 04:44:59,328
these different opinions and finally it's going to happen to the feelings.

4903
04:44:59,329 --> 04:45:04,036
Thanks for watching. I love this morning in the childhood. It's like

4904
04:45:04,037 --> 04:45:06,072
everybody is thinking, okay, I'm off.

4905
04:45:06,073 --> 04:45:09,555
I'll have a move. I was like,

4906
04:45:09,720 --> 04:45:14,456
got in. But because you're going to set your partial

4907
04:45:14,898 --> 04:45:15,460
story. All

4908
04:45:21,333 --> 04:45:23,237
And this guy basically has to go do the job. And I thought, maybe

4909
04:45:23,238 --> 04:45:28,294
there's going to be a guy. Bye. I could see that's not the

4910
04:45:28,295 --> 04:45:32,082
case. So. Like,

4911
04:45:32,083 --> 04:45:36,659
the check, the most often really on the first episode of Compass Manager.

4912
04:45:37,978 --> 04:45:41,310
I think he got pulled in, too. You wouldn't have thought of him as,

4913
04:45:41,311 --> 04:45:45,986
you know, but, uhm, there's nobody that's really good in killing

4914
04:45:45,987 --> 04:45:48,182
us. It's- It's- Okay. It's a- It's an easy job for some of your

4915
04:45:48,183 --> 04:45:48,779
experience. Go ahead. Uh, when it comes to film a reaction from-

4916
04:45:55,278 --> 04:45:57,383
I'm I'm sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm I'm out of the lane.

4917
04:45:57,384 --> 04:45:59,783
Go ahead and try to help with it. It's a well-made thought of the

4918
04:45:59,784 --> 04:46:03,989
hell I'm in. That couldn't be any right to tell me- I'm going to

4919
04:46:03,990 --> 04:46:11,084
follow across- I'm going to ask you guys- hmm.

4920
04:46:11,094 --> 04:46:13,011
And we can get this in the battle eyes. I'll end All right. There's

4921
04:46:13,186 --> 04:46:17,852
welding together on actually sassing the corrosion science.

4922
04:46:18,261 --> 04:46:20,531
We can give that stuff.

4923
04:46:20,532 --> 04:46:25,158
Until I have an order to work, I'm going to also

4924
04:46:25,231 --> 04:46:28,506
open it up.

4925
04:46:28,631 --> 04:46:32,845
Try the babies. Cheers. I'm sure they understand. He did what matters.

4926
04:46:34,130 --> 04:46:37,186
Don't like that, Mr. Welling. He needs to get him tested.

4927
04:46:37,187 --> 04:46:41,820
Let's get started. They're gonna really hate it when

4928
04:46:41,821 --> 04:46:44,398
it's not gonna be used like a really small stick rod.

4929
04:46:44,399 --> 04:46:46,688
I'm stop. I'm gonna fast.

4930
04:46:48,460 --> 04:46:50,932
I don't know if that's not the most efficient way. It's like,

4931
04:46:51,030 --> 04:46:53,716
yeah, it might be the only way to pass it, but it's interesting.

4932
04:46:53,717 --> 04:46:56,157
If there's no commercial test,

4933
04:46:56,266 --> 04:46:59,277
yeah. Yeah, that's where Bitbucket's at,

4934
04:46:59,278 --> 04:47:01,751
they've got, uhm, Cluffins, he's in the air. I will.

4935
04:47:01,752 --> 04:47:05,797
. . . with the comedies. Anybody who just spoke in the world,

4936
04:47:05,798 --> 04:47:09,449
they're making good love about it. They just buy us some new machines to

4937
04:47:09,450 --> 04:47:12,928
do that. I don't how it's going. Of course it goes.

4938
04:47:13,745 --> 04:47:16,169
I don't know how it's going to go. Yeah, it's going to completely.

4939
04:47:16,645 --> 04:47:22,741
I'm just going to pick up. Go. I'm

4940
04:47:22,742 --> 04:47:24,970
out by spreading the ingredients.

4941
04:47:24,971 --> 04:47:27,394
Don't be into it. I love this shot.

4942
04:47:27,395 --> 04:47:36,911
Bye-bye. So,

4943
04:47:36,912 --> 04:47:41,179
this is all like a hundred sixty feet in the air inside a slide.

4944
04:47:41,325 --> 04:47:48,435
Yeah. Yeah. Ladies

4945
04:47:48,436 --> 04:47:50,712
and gentlemen. Yeah.

4946
04:47:51,573 --> 04:47:53,712
Can I have a step a little later around?

4947
04:47:53,713 --> 04:47:55,841
Yeah. Okay. Touch it. Machine?

4948
04:47:56,019 --> 04:47:58,601
Yeah, it becomes going to be more and more popular. You have a little

4949
04:47:59,732 --> 04:48:03,010
bit more. See you pretty much in the back part.

4950
04:48:03,011 --> 04:48:05,468
Yeah. Okay.

4951
04:48:05,469 --> 04:48:07,506
And go. Wait a minute.

4952
04:48:08,016 --> 04:48:10,684
They have machines too. Yeah. It's a good question.

4953
04:48:10,685 --> 04:48:15,470
God you. It'll be a state

4954
04:48:15,471 --> 04:48:17,832
so we can not go after the big interior case.

4955
04:48:18,728 --> 04:48:22,156

4956
04:48:22,157 --> 04:48:25,568

04:48:25,569 --> 04:48:27,996
it will tell us what's going on in favor of the big difference.

4958
04:48:29,784 --> 04:48:32,307
If not, because later well,

4959
04:48:32,308 --> 04:48:34,865
you can use it in all instances. Yeah, pretty much.

4960
04:48:34,866 --> 04:48:38,596
No, uh, yeah. That's the answer to me code. That's not a lot.

4961
04:48:38,597 --> 04:48:42,357
I'm not going to be talking about I'm not going to be talking it.

4967
04:49:12,616 --> 04:49:15,660

04:49:20,591 --> 04:49:25,591
Umm.

4969
04:49:29,591 --> 04:49:32,049
I still think I can find my website, so that's the end of the

4970
04:49:32,050 --> 04:49:34,165
video. Umm,

4971

04:50:21,527 --> 04:50:23,697
So, I'm gonna, Ummm, reinvent.

04:50:23,734 --> 04:50:26,771
I know what kinda Everything can Do not count.

4979

04:57:50,193 --> 04:57:52,696
And, you know, that is a lot of it.

5078

04:58:16,761 --> 04:58:23,032
begin with e-limits. Class of 2020. Yeah.

04:59:30,857 --> 04:59:33,240
It's not. It's exciting.

5110
04:59:34,731 --> 04:59:38,533
I did it to suddenly modify the file to handle a different file for

5111
04:59:38,534 --> 04:59:40,927
growing. Bye. I'm not sure if but I'm just important.

5112
04:59:42,256 --> 04:59:45,448
I don't have any. Oh, sorry. I shouldn't have seen it.

5113
04:59:45,449 --> 04:59:51,006
I shouldn't have seen it. Oh.

5114
04:59:51,298 --> 04:59:55,300
Could've been sick now. But keyboard can have me play.

5115
04:59:55,301 --> 05:00:01,006
Bye. Here's a bit more news. Umm,

5116
05:00:01,017 --> 05:00:03,147
I guess I'll go over that sentence.

5117
05:00:03,148 --> 05:00:05,596
That's it. Later in this,

5118
05:00:05,901 --> 05:00:10,414
I have one question. What ever you have to

5119
05:00:10,415 --> 05:00:15,108
make a new project. Good. Shoulders

5120
05:00:15,109 --> 05:00:18,917
and weights, but it's definitely different as you're thinking and in the summary.

5121
05:00:18,918 --> 05:00:23,456
Good morning. I don't know if it's something that has a

5122
05:00:23,457 --> 05:00:26,514
key talk to them. So I can't,

5123
05:00:26,515 --> 05:00:29,125
I can't grab anything with you. . . Do that,

5124
05:00:29,126 --> 05:00:31,743
on which you see. Like,

5125
05:00:31,744 --> 05:00:33,803
if you're doing it on the other end, I'm just gonna click on it.

5126
05:00:33,804 --> 05:00:38,373
25 foot 7. You have 25 hours of school

5127
05:00:38,374 --> 05:00:41,431
or an admin, you know, we see what the cost is,

5128
05:00:42,112 --> 05:00:44,278
and then figure out. and yeah,

5129
05:00:44,279 --> 05:00:48,776
later it costs to cover the part,

5130
05:00:48,777 --> 05:00:51,911
you just see the one that I think is. Yeah. Yeah.

5131
05:00:50,943 --> 05:00:54,953
Yeah. Yeah,

5132
05:00:54,954 --> 05:00:57,433
because most of that, we factor outside of,

5133
05:00:58,567 --> 05:01:00,856
outside of the system. Stop it.

5134
05:01:00,857 --> 05:01:03,520
Yeah, I actually wish it was going to touch that.

5135
05:01:03,672 --> 05:01:05,804
But, it must have been to, uhm, over city.

5136
05:01:05,805 --> 05:01:10,697
and we'll see I'll see you.

5137
05:01:10,698 --> 05:01:10,744
Bye.

5138
05:02:14,302 --> 05:02:19,302
Umm.

5139
05:02:22,331 --> 05:02:27,268
Oh, hmmm.

5140
05:02:27,278 --> 05:02:32,250
It's one of these now. I love you. Umm.

5141
05:02:32,251 --> 05:02:32,310
Okay.

5142
05:02:54,971 --> 05:02:59,510
It's- It's- It's- It's-

5143
05:02:59,511 --> 05:03:11,573
It's-- . Yeah,

5144
05:03:11,574 --> 05:03:14,320
the varnishing set. That's I'm going to you

5145
05:03:21,971 --> 05:03:28,752
I'm going to go by Oh,

5146
05:03:28,753 --> 05:03:34,313
so. Oh, I'm

5147
05:03:34,314 --> 05:03:36,546
going to go by that thing as I'm going to go by that thing.

5148
05:03:38,711 --> 05:03:42,360
Now I should tell Okay.

5149
05:03:42,361 --> 05:03:42,010
Oh.

5150
05:04:10,871 --> 05:04:15,583
Here,

5151
05:04:15,595 --> 05:04:17,711
we'll manage it, and so I'll give you a side draw,

5152
05:04:17,712 --> 05:04:20,148
do we? Thank Thank you. Yeah, there was,

5153
05:04:20,149 --> 05:04:24,431
uh, there's one, one column that was in your shirt.

5154
05:04:24,736 --> 05:04:26,951
I, uh, I had it. Good.

5155
05:04:26,952 --> 05:04:31,365
I was his main art column to begin in the dry wound.

5156
05:04:31,366 --> 05:04:33,519
Uh, I've been, uh,

5157
05:04:33,530 --> 05:04:36,373
important to you to go. you It's not really,

5158
05:04:37,178 --> 05:04:41,897
it's definitely not really in

5159
05:04:41,898 --> 05:04:45,019
the process. That's Time to get a single day.

5160
05:04:49,643 --> 05:04:53,038
Just make sure some of the- nd, uuh, vuuh, wuh,

5161
05:04:53,039 --> 05:04:57,666
wuh, wuh, Say, ask why did he buy something that we

5162
05:04:57,667 --> 05:05:03,685
can't buy from here. I mean,

5163
05:05:03,686 --> 05:05:07,151
you do as well. Thank you for having us sayin'.

5164
05:05:07,152 --> 05:05:10,069
but I will too further. She is kept down as my pal,

5165
05:05:10,204 --> 05:05:12,340
you know, taking off all the parts,

5166
05:05:12,475 --> 05:05:14,588
you know, the representation in the story, my son,

5167
05:05:14,589 --> 05:05:19,103
I was in so, . Yeah, probably going to have a little bit less

5168
05:05:19,105 --> 05:05:21,674
sort of optimization,

5169
05:05:21,675 --> 05:05:23,236
but at least a table of,

5170
05:05:29,319 --> 05:05:32,252
Yeah, like, fighting. So. Right. Yeah. And it just does. I've got Glasses on

5171
05:05:32,253 --> 05:05:35,455
it. We've got Super on it somewhere.

5172
05:05:35,702 --> 05:05:38,963
Considering we are excited, what was going on is this one.

5173
05:05:39,104 --> 05:05:41,726
I- That's it. I can barely just combine and see it all the way

5174
05:05:41,727 --> 05:05:46,456
to the home. I'm going to get a 2-1

5175
05:05:46,457 --> 05:05:48,982
minute set. So, what do we just want here here?

5176
05:05:48,983 --> 05:05:53,621
Uhh, I don't know if you can escape

5177
05:05:53,622 --> 05:05:57,155
or something else. So, thank you very- I'm keep working with some good about

5178
05:05:57,156 --> 05:06:01,964
it right now. I'm get to the beginning

5179
05:06:01,965 --> 05:06:04,560
of the year. I thought they were only,

5180
05:06:05,234 --> 05:06:08,085
virtually waiting for it to feel. I'm sure we could just tell it to

5181
05:06:08,086 --> 05:06:11,476
help, depending on what the surprise and engagement is.

5182
05:06:11,477 --> 05:06:14,104
It's kind of a part of the second time I've played.

5183
05:06:14,105 --> 05:06:16,578
Umm,

5184
05:06:16,589 --> 05:06:22,267
I couldn't make it seem that way, so. Thank you. Depending

5185
05:06:22,268 --> 05:06:24,448
on how much work you need to do in the back when you get

5186
05:06:24,449 --> 05:06:26,541
that XF on the look that way is,

5187
05:06:27,185 --> 05:06:30,094
whether or not we're gonna- we are a natural and benefit to this and

5188
05:06:30,095 --> 05:06:33,074
we are. Well, I'd have to be looking into those cars so we don't

5189
05:06:33,075 --> 05:06:36,071
know which other quantity you're interested in.

5190
05:06:36,072 --> 05:06:38,857
Trying to be all this long without the cars would be a tight pass.

5191
05:06:38,858 --> 05:06:39,310
house.

5192
05:06:44,051 --> 05:06:47,061
Probably,

5193
05:06:47,075 --> 05:06:48,181
we think we're doing this by hand and we have a show just on

5194
05:06:48,195 --> 05:06:51,492
its eye on something. Yeah, the next Well,

5195
05:06:51,493 --> 05:06:53,556
there's of this. I've our window, of course, I've All right. You Yeah,

5196
05:06:53,651 --> 05:06:55,782
yeah, the shots made more intuitive.

5197
05:06:55,857 --> 05:06:58,350
You can't sit and do our same to my shot.

5198
05:06:58,467 --> 05:07:03,206
So, go ahead and let's- do what it

5199
05:07:03,207 --> 05:07:06,186
makes sense. You need to grasp it and get it suddenly with their cards,

5200
05:07:06,187 --> 05:07:09,512
and all that stuff. Uh, please. You just drop the parts and the rest

5201
05:07:09,513 --> 05:07:16,468
of the the rest. See you later. Let's go over

5202
05:07:16,469 --> 05:07:17,988
any of that bit. So it's the same. I don't know what it's doing.

5203
05:07:19,500 --> 05:07:21,000
I actually don't know what this is happening. you

5204
05:07:25,091 --> 05:07:27,597
I need it.

5205
05:07:27,598 --> 05:07:30,108
It's uh, the only guy who's been here at least in a super simple

5206
05:07:30,109 --> 05:07:32,655
but subtle sense of this room used to be. We'll,

5207
05:07:32,656 --> 05:07:34,943
uh... Let's we Yes. Oh, uh, This room,

5208
05:07:34,944 --> 05:07:38,103
excuse me, is an L-shirt, burp,

5209
05:07:38,602 --> 05:07:41,437
and then you're just going to be down through this house and near this

5210
05:07:41,438 --> 05:07:44,758
house. And, uh,

5211
05:07:44,768 --> 05:07:46,917
why are the words in the pen,

5212
05:07:46,918 --> 05:07:49,071
my table all used to be that I'm all looking at.

5213
05:07:49,072 --> 05:07:51,931
Thanks for watching. We installed a new role in order to,

5214
05:07:52,691 --> 05:07:56,540
you know, shout out to all three leaders. This is it,

5215
05:07:56,541 --> 05:08:00,362
just now I'm back. I'll leave. You It's gonna kill a facility with all

5216
05:08:00,363 --> 05:08:03,593
the facts. You can't do it. You know what I huh?

5217
05:08:03,594 --> 05:08:06,100
You know what I'm gonna it into this? It's about to- .

5218
05:08:06,131 --> 05:08:08,729
Back to the door. So,

5219
05:08:09,786 --> 05:08:14,218
that used to be just a quad that went- .

5220
05:08:14,219 --> 05:08:16,795
. . . . . . . . . And late,

5221
05:08:16,796 --> 05:08:20,280
because of our personal satisfaction in the internet,

5222
05:08:20,492 --> 05:08:25,578
it's not. Just

5223
05:08:25,579 --> 05:08:28,622
everything with my monitor. And I want all this monitor.

5224

three time I'm in the zip, three or forty years,

5226
05:08:33,619 --> 05:08:37,014
I wouldn't have said it was back here. You know,

5227
05:08:37,015 --> 05:08:43,568
we're going to build an office above the shan- I don't know I'm

5228
05:08:43,569 --> 05:08:45,672
removing it, but that one's uh.

5229
05:08:45,683 --> 05:08:48,225
That was a good idea, I never looked. Hello? It's a good stage.

5230
05:08:48,226 --> 05:08:52,756
See you in the room.

5236
05:09:20,017 --> 05:09:22,148
that. My last day.

5237
05:09:22,843 --> 05:09:26,729
Oh, yeah. I think I did a video,

5238
05:09:26,730 --> 05:09:32,095
son. I hope that it was I'm trying to look

5239
05:09:32,096 --> 05:09:35,563
at it, and it didn't work, but that is probably my computer,

5240
05:09:35,883 --> 05:09:38,410
the one you- I think that it didn't, it was a weird spot on

5241
05:09:38,411 --> 05:09:42,140
the bottom. And I almost said it was fine.

5242

5272
05:12:07,084 --> 05:12:09,256
letter. Uhh, I'm going to carry my knee going to,

5273
05:12:09,257 --> 05:12:12,450
I'm running everything through the show. I did a bit of the editing program,

5274
05:12:12,451 --> 05:12:15,259
creating the code, the story now. I'm welcome. And if the editing work,

5275
05:12:15,580 --> 05:12:18,256
I'm I'm going to be taking a tutorial in a first, with the speed

5276
05:12:18,257 --> 05:12:20,660
visit. I'm making the cut-ups very now,

5277
05:12:20,725 --> 05:12:24,835
you know, the environment supports, and then we can smell all that in the

5278
05:12:24,836 --> 05:12:28,023
end and say. ... Jira. And go around and go to the gears,

5279
05:12:28,024 --> 05:12:31,334
I want to make all this documentation, fire, if this is what you want,

5281
05:12:35,339 --> 05:12:39,753
know that the electrical database portion is working and I'll take this exactly,

5282
05:12:39,754 --> 05:12:42,590
you know, to calculate. Good. Put it in the Jira,

5283
05:12:42,769 --> 05:12:47,339
and it'll be enough so that they have to go along

5284
05:12:47,340 --> 05:12:49,456
and you can see that it's soft, you know.

5285
05:12:49,457 --> 05:12:54,707
. But, I'm

5286

5289
05:13:03,938 --> 05:13:06,191
No problem. Let's do it. Okay.

5290
05:13:06,192 --> 05:13:08,326

We're going be on.

5299
05:13:48,251 --> 05:13:52,089
Ehm,

5300
05:13:52,759 --> 05:13:55,494
a snowman on blue and red and a bat.

5301
05:13:55,495 --> 05:14:00,147
Perfect. Okay,

I have to recap.

5311
05:15:00,326 --> 05:15:03,044
Some people don't want to say to be honest, where they have a type

5312
05:15:03,045 --> 05:15:05,327
of care. . Jira, Loom, Confluence, Jira,

5313
05:15:10,550 --> 05:15:13,307
Just staying with the staff. Yeah, I was cutting it,

5314
05:15:13,308 --> 05:15:17,174
but people broke it. Yeah, yeah.

5315
05:15:18,613 --> 05:15:21,637
I am ready. I am ready. I don't know if I was watching her.

5316
05:15:22,172 --> 05:15:22,352
And,

5317
05:15:54,311 --> 05:15:57,603
I think I'm not mistaken.

5318
05:15:57,604 --> 05:16:00,154
There are permissions there.

5319
05:16:00,155 --> 05:16:02,291
There. There.

5320
05:16:02,292 --> 05:16:04,487

5321
05:16:04,488 --> 05:16:07,260
uhh, uhh, uhh,

5322

Default, uhh,

5324
05:16:12,781 --> 05:16:16,211
workshop. So then they don't see their show.

5325
05:16:16,575 --> 05:16:19,318
Yeah. In many campuses,

5326
05:16:19,319 --> 05:16:21,168
they have been watching what it was today. Thank you.

5327
05:18:27,131 --> 05:18:31,790

5333
05:19:06,835 --> 05:19:09,399
a good week. MSWordDoc Word Usually they, uh,

5334
05:19:09,410 --> 05:19:11,612
usually they have each other and you have to spend some,

5335
05:19:11,613 --> 05:19:16,559
it's just clogging. And that's

5336
05:19:16,560 --> 05:19:19,479
the best that one for you. Come on,

5337
05:19:19,480 --> 05:19:22,698

5340
05:19:40,451 --> 05:19:43,828
I don't know what type of music I'd expect of you to do this

5341
05:19:43,829 --> 05:19:47,002
to me. Haha, what were you expecting? I don't know what I'm expecting.

5342
05:19:47,879 --> 05:19:51,896
I don't know for electric park assignments,

5343
05:19:51,897 --> 05:19:54,457
but since my case here days, let's do it.

5344
05:19:54,860 --> 05:19:57,436
I was building a park, even though I barely like all the stuff.

5345
05:19:57,437 --> 05:20:01,564
I like the car. There you go. That's amazing.

5346
05:20:01,735 --> 05:20:04,585
You never really know. Oh,

5347
05:20:04,586 --> 05:20:07,360
I'm not sure you need- In a country, you need that.

5348
05:20:08,153 --> 05:20:10,388
E.D.M. and the other kids.

5349
05:20:10,424 --> 05:20:13,221
There's only two kids, visit Patrick Foster.

5350
05:20:13,222 --> 05:20:17,989
That's Good. Yeah. I said, I can listen

5351
05:20:17,990 --> 05:20:21,431
up, you can accept jazz. I just don't get jazz.

5352
05:20:21,432 --> 05:20:25,952
It's just like, how can I play it as off as

5353
05:20:25,953 --> 05:20:29,231
possible, but still, it didn't be considered.

5354
05:20:29,232 --> 05:20:33,333
Zoom. I still like classical art too.

5355
05:20:33,334 --> 05:20:38,164
Yeah. Yeah. I

5356
05:20:38,165 --> 05:20:40,290
want to see you change, David.

5357
05:20:40,460 --> 05:20:42,655
Oh, and you're at Red Rocks, whoo,

5358
05:20:42,656 --> 05:20:45,361
Denver. It's like I'm here to be so whole.

5359
05:20:45,362 --> 05:20:49,195
Oh. But it's not a good story to me. I saw him last year.

5360
05:20:49,835 --> 05:20:53,236
He thought through songs. I didn't get her tape back in the book.

5361
05:20:53,237 --> 05:20:55,655
Okay. Uh, well, he did a big concert again.

5362
05:20:55,656 --> 05:20:58,179
Uh, so, uh, it a big thing.

5363
05:20:58,202 --> 05:21:00,710
He won. He was the one over there. He played 30 more.

5364
05:21:00,711 --> 05:21:03,002
So, I was like, he I it's, you know,

5365
05:21:03,003 --> 05:21:05,193
wherever it is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

metal panels. That's it. The command I just left,

5379
05:21:43,663 --> 05:21:47,222
they didn't want. Oh, okay. That's what's going on. I haven't been in my

5380
05:21:47,226 --> 05:21:49,960

and then I'll be in my club in there.

5385
05:22:04,313 --> 05:22:06,667
They won't let you stay in there in concert,

5386
05:22:06,668 --> 05:22:10,229
if they're afraid. You don't get to be on a toilet or something.

5387
05:22:10,554 --> 05:22:13,385
It's going to end. You know, it's your point of view.

Yeah, it looks just super simple. Thank you.

5416
05:24:01,577 --> 05:24:04,323
Yeah, that's why I was wondering how,

5417
05:24:04,327 --> 05:24:07,596
yeah, can you run this? I thought I'd have to put it in a

5418
05:24:07,597 --> 05:24:11,433
really good way. I'd say this. Go ahead and I'll end this if you

5419
05:24:11,434 --> 05:24:14,749
haven't said it. So what,

5420
05:24:14,750 --> 05:24:17,596
what would you guys do on your song, just change or play it?

5421
05:24:17,597 --> 05:24:21,533
for this. Umm,

5422
05:24:21,543 --> 05:24:25,235
I think that's, obviously, for running a specialty metal and a stainless steel.

5423
05:24:25,236 --> 05:24:27,936
You know. All of, um, we'll switch out,

5424
05:24:27,937 --> 05:24:30,551
um, I guess we're about on cutting,

5425
05:24:30,552 --> 05:24:33,807
right? We're going to have a first play too, so, um. You are the

5426
05:24:33,808 --> 05:24:37,789
likely guy. But I would imagine that the blades you use for a beam

5427
05:24:38,120 --> 05:24:40,231
to a good job cutting, you know, structure.

5428
05:24:40,338 --> 05:24:44,670
Yeah. Yeah. I'm probably going for a little bit finer,

5429
05:24:44,671 --> 05:24:46,816
but she's like the subject,

5430
05:24:47,168 --> 05:24:49,571
initially have. around.

5431
05:24:49,572 --> 05:24:54,571
Okay,

5432
05:24:54,998 --> 05:24:58,181
I gotta get my look on the part, it's just, that saw was working.

5433
05:24:58,182 --> 05:25:00,387
Bye. Bye bye. Hey, what's . Interrupting here, y'know,

5434
05:25:00,388 --> 05:25:02,822
I better just, uhm, for a day and change the blame,

5435
05:25:02,823 --> 05:25:11,088
go ahead. Good. By

5436
05:25:11,089 --> 05:25:13,921
the way, there is a limited thing about this.

5437
05:25:14,632 --> 05:25:18,608
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, I've had a few weeks ago,

5438
05:25:18,609 --> 05:25:23,115
so probably closing out some of your television projects would be good.

5439
05:25:22,865 --> 05:25:25,770
Good. V. Ehm, V.

5440
05:25:25,771 --> 05:25:30,822
Ehm, V. Ehm, V. Ehm, vignettes, and the filter list reveals all the jobs.

5441
05:25:30,998 --> 05:25:34,594
Nice thing. Good. Yeah.

5442
05:25:34,595 --> 05:25:34,460
You

5443
05:25:40,571 --> 05:25:45,111
So I

5444
05:25:45,120 --> 05:25:48,206
guess give you a question and job don't automatically close the nation.

5445
05:25:48,207 --> 05:25:51,424
Be sure. The jobs they are there.

5446
05:25:51,492 --> 05:25:55,920
So, if everyone seems to want to do it,

5447
05:25:55,921 --> 05:25:57,600
but how did it cause a little p- We'll see you on the I've

5448
05:25:57,601 --> 05:26:00,127
got a change. That's what I've used to be.

5449
05:26:00,128 --> 05:26:04,146
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think we should develop for that.

5450
05:26:04,425 --> 05:26:08,519
We've got a long note. Thank you. Yeah, it's an amazing system we use

5451
05:26:08,520 --> 05:26:12,139
automatically to build on shipment, the most important people would have to open it

5452
05:26:12,140 --> 05:26:17,508
back up soon. You need to do the final thing with

5453
05:26:17,509 --> 05:26:21,480
it. Then we can set the clothes on where to be on to clothes.

5454
05:26:21,481 --> 05:26:20,680
...

5455
05:26:29,531 --> 05:26:31,906
I don't know if this is good or pickling.

5456
05:26:32,133 --> 05:26:35,785
I'm curious, pick that product and it's just one lot.

5457
05:26:35,948 --> 05:26:39,320
Right there in the blue bit. Good. Yeah,

5458
05:26:39,382 --> 05:26:41,839
this one, uh, will be certainly, it's, we're talking like,

5459
05:26:41,840 --> 05:26:47,690
yeah. Good. Then

5460
05:26:47,691 --> 05:26:50,612
open up one of those and uhm,

5461
05:26:50,622 --> 05:26:53,651
or hit the eyeball next to one of them. Bye.

5462
05:26:53,652 --> 05:26:58,492
I'm

5463
05:26:58,493 --> 05:27:04,664
curious about, uhm, okay. you and

5464
05:27:04,665 --> 05:27:09,432
hit the process. The last

5465
05:27:09,433 --> 05:27:15,153
year before the morning. You might be the only

5466
05:27:15,154 --> 05:27:17,737
thing is,

5467
05:27:17,738 --> 05:27:20,002
you Thank you. You can buy no cat vegetables,

5468
05:27:20,003 --> 05:27:23,953
you couldn't. So you've only waited for that.

5469
05:27:23,954 --> 05:27:26,379
It's really gary to the eyeball.

5470
05:27:26,380 --> 05:27:29,392
a lot more. Over there's a process like we did that it tells you

5471
05:27:29,887 --> 05:27:32,724
a ton of love over. Yeah. Thank you.

5472
05:27:35,591 --> 05:27:39,024
Yes,

5473
05:27:39,025 --> 05:27:50,447
and that's what, that's what we were able to You The

5474
05:27:50,526 --> 05:27:53,031
logic's not in here. Here it is. Make sure that it does that.

5475
05:27:53,720 --> 05:27:56,230
There, uhh, cause, you know,

5476
05:27:56,791 --> 05:27:59,256
when they pay up, it's like the actual one,

5477
05:27:59,257 --> 05:28:01,924
man. Bye. Yeah, it's, it's not often you don't,

5478
05:28:02,001 --> 05:28:04,364
but I'm gonna get it on there, and so,

5479
05:28:04,569 --> 05:28:08,020
but it will allow you, so if it's- the Jira,

5480
05:28:08,021 --> 05:28:10,041
Loom, MediRoute, Loom, MediRoute, Loom,

5481
05:28:10,633 --> 05:28:14,665
MediRoute, Loom, MediRoute like one forward.

5482
05:28:15,076 --> 05:28:18,296
So, You can say I've got four of those in there,

5483
05:28:18,417 --> 05:28:20,692
right there, to process all four boys.

5484
05:28:20,693 --> 05:28:23,244
Interesting to take that time.

5485
05:28:23,332 --> 05:28:25,573
Bye. One, two, three, eight, five, and I don't.

5486
05:28:26,448 --> 05:28:31,103
Five and five, eights. But there must be some little slope in

5487
05:28:31,636 --> 05:28:32,149
Something.

5488
05:28:36,402 --> 05:28:40,273
Well, I guess what I'm saying is you can really get done very unusually

5489
05:28:40,274 --> 05:28:43,764
in the mix. Thanks. Stuck, because they're just so slightly different.

5490
05:28:43,848 --> 05:28:46,091
Yeah. Yeah.

5491
05:28:46,092 --> 05:28:48,611
Now, if you add- Have a nice day.

5492
05:28:48,612 --> 05:28:51,579
I've got lots in your nuts.

5493
05:28:52,445 --> 05:28:55,696
You can probably eliminate all those different blanks.

5494
05:28:55,697 --> 05:29:00,290
Thanks. And just let the extra stick out and blow your nuts

5495
05:29:01,172 --> 05:29:04,631
on a 74mm. Yeah, that, there we go.

5496
05:29:04,632 --> 05:29:07,008
and then we'll, we'll get some more help.

5497
05:29:07,176 --> 05:29:09,803
So I think it, you know,

5498
05:29:09,804 --> 05:29:12,888
somehow identify. Bye Oh,

5499
05:29:12,889 --> 05:29:15,271
I haven't figured that. Did you see how close that worked?

5500
05:29:15,272 --> 05:29:18,782
And what? Ls are the rings.

5501
05:29:19,172 --> 05:29:23,836
Oh, that's the drop. Bye bye. So, can I go back and

5502
05:29:23,837 --> 05:29:26,510
go here? See,

5503
05:29:26,511 --> 05:29:28,631
these are 10,000, 6, 3, 1, first. Never.

5504
05:29:28,632 --> 05:29:30,672
If you're a bar and it's 21st,

5505
05:29:30,673 --> 05:29:33,168
we can bike through this channel. If I need it,

5506
05:29:33,169 --> 05:29:36,671
it's easier We're going to talk back to it.

5507
05:29:36,399 --> 05:29:39,429
It kinda got here, it just drops.

5508
05:29:39,666 --> 05:29:43,889
So, yeah. So if you,

5509
05:29:43,890 --> 05:29:46,334
You You can win for 20s,

5510
05:29:46,335 --> 05:29:50,857
but is it, You can create a stock list that lets you win the

5511
05:29:50,858 --> 05:29:54,032
films in 12s? Thank very much. Yeah,

5512
05:29:54,268 --> 05:29:58,832
yeah, I combined the next 20s and 12s and 22nds and 20s.

5513
05:29:58,833 --> 05:30:02,822
Support. or, But it's always looking for the,

5514
05:30:03,750 --> 05:30:05,763
well, the message factor.

5515
05:30:05,764 --> 05:30:08,667
So, it's gonna try and, uh,

5516
05:30:08,668 --> 05:30:10,751
I mean,

5517
05:30:10,752 --> 05:30:12,876
that's the worst, it's the best possible.

5518
05:30:13,287 --> 05:30:15,419
So, what's the uh, 9-5-9-5,

5519
05:30:15,420 --> 05:30:17,651
and 7-8 should drop in there? Okay. Yeah.

5520
05:30:16,760 --> 05:30:19,129
Yeah, that's what you're going to be talking about.

5521
05:30:19,177 --> 05:30:21,971
Yeah, we're in, and we're going to start ahead for it. Just come through.

5522
05:30:21,972 --> 05:30:24,520
We're going to pay back for this, and take it for the sixth.

5523
05:30:24,951 --> 05:30:28,009
Yeah, thanks for- All of my accessories are dropped in way too much.

5524
05:30:29,128 --> 05:30:31,565
Yeah, we're gonna be followed.

5525
05:30:31,566 --> 05:30:33,863
That's, that's our problem. I'll see you in the next video.

5529
05:30:48,202 --> 05:30:50,177
That's an odd one. Give it a little finish. I'll see you in the

5530
05:30:50,178 --> 05:30:52,581
next video. Jira, Sennie,

5531
05:30:52,582 --> 05:30:55,496
B. Go.

5532
05:30:56,618 --> 05:30:58,696
Team B, uh, Team B, um, B, um.

5533
05:30:58,697 --> 05:31:05,338
... Yeah,

5534
05:31:05,339 --> 05:31:07,428
at the city. Only thing at the wall at least. . . I was

5535
05:31:07,429 --> 05:31:11,352
like, did you have a little bit of a check?

5536
05:31:11,353 --> 05:31:14,716
I don't know, how will that be like a monkey pet?

5537
05:31:14,717 --> 05:31:18,606
you have a little bit of a spider.

5538
05:31:19,730 --> 05:31:22,095
Pretty big, but it's quite a long time.

5539
05:31:22,096 --> 05:31:25,171
Uh, this one was- That's what we wanted to ask Jimmy is if it

5540
05:31:25,172 --> 05:31:27,703
was- Well, I was the threaded end.

5541
05:31:28,323 --> 05:31:30,503
Is it a drought with the threaded end? I don't know,

5542
05:31:30,504 --> 05:31:33,158
it's a double sh- Shout as a prayer. Have a thrill at the bottom

5543
05:31:33,159 --> 05:31:35,693
of the correct space. Umm, or,

5544
05:31:36,040 --> 05:31:39,071
cause it needs to be bought and resolved for it, or,

5545
05:31:39,072 --> 05:31:41,433
Uhh, well, by that endowment,

5546
05:31:41,434 --> 05:31:44,903
it's not right, it's not right, it's it's not That's what I believe is,

5547
05:31:44,915 --> 05:31:48,422
is tuck and stone. I'm Nope.

5548
05:31:48,423 --> 05:31:51,717
Uh.

5549
05:31:51,728 --> 05:31:54,681
And I'd be surprised if they would spend the end and be so much

5550
05:31:54,682 --> 05:31:57,507
leverage. that is a. . . It's just been an offer. You think you

5551
05:31:57,508 --> 05:31:59,528
have full of trust and okay ability from that.

5552
05:32:03,191 --> 05:32:07,245
But, I have seen great new things,

5553
05:32:07,368 --> 05:32:12,356
so. Hello. It honestly,

5554
05:32:13,944 --> 05:32:17,005
you would think that there's a supplier that just supplies the store out of

5555
05:32:17,006 --> 05:32:21,918
the grass, and it was your own- I'm pretty sure I can

5556
05:32:21,919 --> 05:32:24,252
find some videos.

5557
05:32:24,253 --> 05:32:27,316
It's so small. Almost.

5558
05:32:27,317 --> 05:32:31,325
Oh, maybe that's the least market we're getting into.

5559
05:32:31,326 --> 05:32:34,236
So, you know, I never really helped.

5560
05:32:34,237 --> 05:32:38,294
Thank you. They got a hope that somebody looked,

5561
05:32:38,295 --> 05:32:41,496
uh, see if they could buy a hat,

5562
05:32:41,628 --> 05:32:45,493
and then they said, well, for this part, We can do it way,

5563
05:32:45,532 --> 05:32:47,583
you know, for after price, and,

5564
05:32:48,837 --> 05:32:51,431
For the lead time is,

5565
05:32:51,432 --> 05:32:53,774
Three months and we need them in three weeks.

5566
05:32:55,069 --> 05:32:59,476
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

5567
05:32:59,477 --> 05:33:02,190
I don't, I don't see any issue in the middle of this thing.

5568
05:33:03,426 --> 05:33:05,869
I'm only one of the educators, but,

5569
05:33:06,348 --> 05:33:10,240
I mean, this is, We've rained on the initial projects through here,

5570
05:33:10,454 --> 05:33:12,853
in our eyes, in night, day,

5571
05:33:12,874 --> 05:33:15,028
for anything to run. Yeah.

5572
05:33:14,676 --> 05:33:17,342
Yeah. That's, I mean,

5573
05:33:17,343 --> 05:33:20,289
I guess, I guess, I'm not even there. The XLM protocol.

5574
05:33:20,580 --> 05:33:23,313
I've given them the examples, the XLM policies,

5575
05:33:23,314 --> 05:33:27,984
same. . . So, would you take the time in their

5576
05:33:27,985 --> 05:33:31,631
database to get rid of that?

5577
05:33:31,632 --> 05:33:34,575
. I've been trying to put the right stuff in so I can't afford

5578
05:33:35,585 --> 05:33:38,083
it. Yeah, I mean, it was all throughout. I think it's just going in

5579
05:33:38,422 --> 05:33:41,748
and switching to all throughout. Good. Good. It's going to keep the same,

5580
05:33:42,890 --> 05:33:46,401
it's going to keep the same logic so it's not even going from a

5581
05:33:46,402 --> 05:33:49,830
linear to a plate. you I'm going near you,

5582
05:33:50,958 --> 05:33:54,515
just have to operate with a rod and go.

5583
05:33:54,516 --> 05:33:56,575
Don't. Have an inch.

5584
05:33:57,582 --> 05:33:59,604
It's going to be a massive amount of length,

5585
05:33:59,605 --> 05:34:02,350
and we're going to keep the same length,

5586
05:34:02,568 --> 05:34:04,532
so it's going to be all closed. that is, I was saying that I

5587
05:34:04,533 --> 05:34:07,356
haven't been across the border, so,

5588
05:34:07,359 --> 05:34:10,065
and that, I can get a 140% hand.

5589
05:34:10,814 --> 05:34:13,350
So, but. But, Actually,

5590
05:34:13,351 --> 05:34:16,698
it's one of their songs, but it's different.

5591
05:34:16,699 --> 05:34:19,028
Did you make the head of peace tracking on or about?

5592
05:34:19,029 --> 05:34:22,245
Watch. Uhh, I think it's the people.

5593
05:34:22,870 --> 05:34:25,572
But yeah, that's the people, the people for that.

5594
05:34:26,410 --> 05:34:29,686
So, peace tracking is on for a- everything is all around me and sending

5595
05:34:29,687 --> 05:34:32,240
me roads and the apartments. Okay. So, and then, uh,

5596
05:34:32,251 --> 05:34:35,956
so now, Okay.

5597
05:34:35,957 --> 05:34:39,432
and on there So have to Okay. Now we have cut saw and burn

5598
05:34:39,433 --> 05:34:43,106
routes that are just for parts and then we have,

5599
05:34:43,107 --> 05:34:46,879
uhm, I'm faking wild for the main assembly.

5600
05:34:47,233 --> 05:34:50,810
Gotcha. Gotta change that symmetry.

5601
05:34:50,811 --> 05:34:52,868
Thank much for your attention. Beep, Beep, Beep,

5602
05:34:52,869 --> 05:34:55,964
Beep, Beep, Beep

5603
05:35:00,076 --> 05:35:04,773
Perk? Should I have this

5604
05:35:04,774 --> 05:35:04,930
shit? Thank you.

5605
05:35:25,751 --> 05:35:29,688
Big confirm,

5606
05:35:29,689 --> 05:35:33,141
alternate way of middle,

5607
05:35:33,142 --> 05:35:38,123
you know. and It'll

5608
05:35:38,124 --> 05:35:43,751
be a long time. It'll a long time.

5609
05:35:43,752 --> 05:35:46,087
Yeah.

5610
05:35:46,088 --> 05:35:48,368
That's why I don't really use it for a tune. That's fine.

5611
05:35:48,369 --> 05:35:51,082
It's fine. It's good. It's good.

5612
05:35:51,083 --> 05:35:52,994
I'm mad. and Abatl, F.S.E.R.T.T.S.R.T.T but that's because I think, know, you really have

5613
05:35:52,995 --> 05:35:53,676
to ask for a part of this.

5614
05:35:59,771 --> 05:36:02,594
If I was ready to tell, let's show you the channel and,

5615
05:36:02,595 --> 05:36:05,167
uh, I'll never agree with the end of the fact that I forgot to

5616
05:36:05,168 --> 05:36:08,368
like piss off my toilet with you. Thank So.

5617
05:36:09,639 --> 05:36:12,469
Look at her. She's freaking making my way to me.

5618
05:36:12,470 --> 05:36:14,724
Piss up the courtesy for you. I'm like,

5619
05:36:14,725 --> 05:36:17,037
what you telling me on? So yeah, like,

5620
05:36:17,038 --> 05:36:19,775
ah. Sorry I forgot I was freaking moving.

5621
05:36:19,776 --> 05:36:22,345
I'm gonna pick up all of them then.

5622
05:36:22,714 --> 05:36:27,696
You He

5623
05:36:27,697 --> 05:36:30,504
used be my boss. Jimmy used to be, you know, Donna Stanley.

5624
05:36:30,505 --> 05:36:35,795
Thank you very much. Jira

5625
05:36:35,796 --> 05:36:39,306
was quite honest,

5626
05:36:39,307 --> 05:36:39,487
and Jimmy was like, you know, it's been hard when he came and I

5627
05:36:39,488 --> 05:36:43,988
bought it. But my

5628
05:36:43,989 --> 05:36:46,189
interview was, uh, I don't know where,

5629
05:36:46,190 --> 05:36:49,037
you worked hard. All right. No job.

5630
05:36:49,745 --> 05:36:52,654
Just don't even worry, you can go right in. Uhh,

5631
05:36:52,665 --> 05:36:55,009
we'll figure that out on Monday. Let's see it, 6 a.m.

5632
05:36:55,546 --> 05:36:59,588
Alright. Alright. That's when I got all the books for Valatrol and I just

5633
05:36:59,589 --> 05:37:02,840
started reading. Ha ha ha. Ready?

5634
05:37:02,841 --> 05:37:03,791
I'm here. Thank you. Thank you. I'll see you Bye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

5635
05:37:03,792 --> 05:37:06,694
I wasn't gonna figure that one out.

5636
05:37:07,861 --> 05:37:09,869
And this one was a lot easier. We'll have more uh,

5637
05:37:09,879 --> 05:37:11,974
more videos for it. Thank attention. And a minute. Thank you. Yeah,

5638
05:37:11,975 --> 05:37:16,524
yeah. So, look. That's very fascinating.

5639
05:37:16,854 --> 05:37:19,635
Well, that's a lot more flexible to the uh, 20 version.

5640
05:37:19,636 --> 05:37:22,446
I think it's a lot of the same type of paper to a model.

5641
05:37:22,624 --> 05:37:25,229
Yeah, no, I didn't. Here's where you do this.

5642
05:37:25,599 --> 05:37:27,856
Let's go right. They'll last me in business. Thank you very much.

5643
05:37:27,857 --> 05:37:29,896
Yes. Uh, you know,

5644
05:37:29,897 --> 05:37:32,914
put it in here. Especially,

5645
05:37:33,047 --> 05:37:35,836
estimate. It's hard to get this by you.

5646
05:37:35,837 --> 05:37:39,022
. . I'm sure if you know what I can.

5647
05:37:39,023 --> 05:37:41,460
I'm not sure if you know what I can.

5648
05:37:41,506 --> 05:37:43,811
I'm sure if you know what I can.

5649
05:37:43,812 --> 05:37:47,340
But, uhm,

5650
05:37:47,351 --> 05:37:50,763
I also have to do all my manual world paper apps.

5651
05:37:51,574 --> 05:37:54,067
Ohhh. Yeah, pretty cool.

5652
05:37:54,388 --> 05:37:58,255
Buying your stuff, your wash with 90 gums to calculate the molds,

5653
05:37:58,490 --> 05:38:00,791
everything else is easy. I get all the rest of the dust.

5654
05:38:00,792 --> 05:38:04,091
But the world take us over and over 90 gums to each joint.

5655
05:38:04,288 --> 05:38:06,922
Well, it's not the issues. Yeah,

5656
05:38:06,923 --> 05:38:09,892
and then. So. Oh That's the advice.

5657
05:38:09,899 --> 05:38:14,582
You have no paper tokens, and I'm over the shop next month that I

5658
05:38:14,583 --> 05:38:16,811
had a version of a separate opportunity. This is,

5659
05:38:16,812 --> 05:38:19,160
I don't know, two years ago.

5660
05:38:19,161 --> 05:38:21,855
And, there in the estimator,

5661
05:38:21,856 --> 05:38:24,540
one of the negative and everyone in here.

5662
05:38:24,396 --> 05:38:27,041
here. It's in the light of your kids,

5663
05:38:27,042 --> 05:38:29,610
let it do the kind of thing. He was adamant that you want to

5664
05:38:29,611 --> 05:38:32,431
admit it. But I have not said a list of letters and all of

5665
05:38:32,432 --> 05:38:34,493
it will be- I'm like, why are you doing this?

5666
05:38:34,494 --> 05:38:38,009
Why are you having that baby? So it's taking a look for how long

5667
05:38:38,010 --> 05:38:40,267
you're listening, you know. Well,

5668
05:38:40,268 --> 05:38:44,260
that's it. Exactly. I don't want to be curious to see what she'll do

5669
05:38:44,261 --> 05:38:46,525
on that night. I'm not. Hey, hey,

5670
05:38:46,591 --> 05:38:51,567
hey. Goodbye. Go ahead. That's uhm,

5671
05:38:51,578 --> 05:38:56,120
that's a, as we say, 3.20.

5672
05:38:56,121 --> 05:38:58,669
We'll see you in Okay, yeah,

5673
05:38:58,670 --> 05:39:01,415
well, 3.20, 3.20,

5674
05:39:01,416 --> 05:39:04,100
18.20, 19.00.

5675
05:39:04,400 --> 05:39:05,461
All right. Yeah, yeah,

5676
05:39:12,856 --> 05:39:15,599
When there was a phasing came over and then we got to the point

5677
05:39:15,600 --> 05:39:18,177
where we were like, pop up. We ain't sayin' shit.

5678
05:39:18,286 --> 05:39:20,831
Yeah. Dude, we can't do shit over and you're using that.

5679
05:39:20,832 --> 05:39:22,995
I don't care. I'm gonna say,

5680
05:39:23,060 --> 05:39:26,588
okay, I guess I'm gonna do it. You put people in a bigger setting

5681
05:39:26,600 --> 05:39:30,474
and we're working on that and we're facing the- And then they're not really

5682
05:39:30,475 --> 05:39:33,479
building things, I can't even gain that in school.

5683
05:39:33,595 --> 05:39:36,366
I love going to shops and then say,

5684
05:39:36,367 --> 05:39:38,641
alright, go My Monday, here's where we're shopping,

5685
05:39:38,642 --> 05:39:42,412
so I get it. I'll just run it down and then I'll feed it

5686
05:39:42,413 --> 05:39:44,421
out a little bit. Yeah.

5687
05:39:43,972 --> 05:39:46,368
Yeah. Well, that's how I wasn't this.

5688
05:39:47,079 --> 05:39:50,040
I, uh, when I started applying it for permission to make it every day

5689
05:39:50,041 --> 05:39:52,361
and it's similar. Yeah. It is, you like it.

5690
05:39:52,698 --> 05:39:54,810
Oh. What happened with that? Okay. Yeah.

5691
05:39:54,811 --> 05:39:57,765
Alright. I'm gonna figure I'm gonna fix it. And it's good.

5692
05:39:57,853 --> 05:40:00,696
Okay. Alright. That's how you do your pins out.

5693
05:40:00,697 --> 05:40:04,034
Go. I'm gonna get the benefits that you may or may or may not

5694
05:40:04,035 --> 05:40:06,044
work through. So, yeah.

5695
05:40:06,045 --> 05:40:08,585
Which, now I'm not even allowed to.

5696
05:40:08,696 --> 05:40:10,786
You to be a lot of different things in New York.

5697
05:40:11,268 --> 05:40:14,397
Honestly, we're introducing all the things that have been really impossible,

5698
05:40:15,050 --> 05:40:18,336
and that haven't really had the beats in town. Most people know,

5699
05:40:18,337 --> 05:40:20,472
I had to use it, but,

5700
05:40:20,473 --> 05:40:23,295
um, yeah, most people don't have to.

5701
05:40:23,296 --> 05:40:28,099
Um, I mean. You are invested by this stuff in this film.

5702
05:40:29,301 --> 05:40:31,680
It's all projects and running on myself.

5703
05:40:31,681 --> 05:40:34,813
the whole thing. I didn't want it against it.

5704
05:40:35,060 --> 05:40:38,591
Our break off was, if it was detailed as a production job,

5705
05:40:38,592 --> 05:40:40,871
it wasn't detailed. Yeah.

5706
05:40:40,872 --> 05:40:45,013
I figured that's where it's going to be. It's for some local contracting.

5707
05:40:45,014 --> 05:40:48,916
It's not going down. We probably ran a couple of million dollars.

5708
05:40:53,726 --> 05:40:54,781
And it's great for, you know, all the impotory and it would be a

5709
05:40:54,782 --> 05:40:56,891
week.

5710
05:40:56,892 --> 05:40:59,684
We could create the invoice about here and,

5711
05:40:59,685 --> 05:41:01,822
uh, so it was good for any type of stuff, but it's 100% paper

5712
05:41:01,823 --> 05:41:06,012
drive. B-I-T-R that you hate to anything.

5713
05:41:06,013 --> 05:41:08,255
I'll be able to agree. So, uh,

5714
05:41:08,265 --> 05:41:12,279
ask. Oh, I was gonna ask you how strong the invention is this year.

5715
05:41:12,509 --> 05:41:16,054
Yeah. Go. It's good. It's, it gets better in the,

5716
05:41:16,055 --> 05:41:20,296
uh, I try to get them to do more sessions.

5717
05:41:20,463 --> 05:41:23,450
I did. On 1 3 2 sections. Um,

5718
05:41:23,460 --> 05:41:25,908
but I figured, yeah, the more sessions they do,

5719
05:41:25,909 --> 05:41:28,000
the more people you come. Uh. And now let's go.

5720
05:41:28,001 --> 05:41:30,493
Let's go. I'm gonna get yeah, I'm scared. This is good.

5721
05:41:30,980 --> 05:41:34,194
Yeah, the problem is it's a bill. Yeah,

5722
05:41:34,195 --> 05:41:37,995
so they've not heard it yet. good. And,

5723
05:41:37,996 --> 05:41:40,675
uh, uhm,

5724
05:41:40,676 --> 05:41:42,962
uhm, uhm,

5725
05:41:42,963 --> 05:41:44,956
uhm,

5726
05:41:50,297 --> 05:41:50,731
and, uh, they have this to integrate with the PTO system. And do it

5727
05:41:50,732 --> 05:41:52,931
all that. Yeah, yeah. Go.

5728
05:41:52,932 --> 05:41:56,399
So anyway,

5729
05:41:56,400 --> 05:41:58,719
it's too long, it should be me. Then.

5730
05:42:00,916 --> 05:42:03,214
and it's not a woman,

5731
05:42:03,215 --> 05:42:05,363
man. They ain't, they ain't, they ain't.

5732
05:42:05,364 --> 05:42:08,178
The cool thing about it is, you know, they, they are a bit of

5733
05:42:08,179 --> 05:42:11,801
a help. No. No. I want to hear from you and what you want.

5734
05:42:11,802 --> 05:42:14,539
This is like, they did one session. We'll bring a,

5735
05:42:14,540 --> 05:42:16,931
we'll bring up the video on it, but. Hello. Hello.

5736
05:42:16,932 --> 05:42:19,740
I do one session where it's like, okay, here's what's coming,

5737
05:42:19,741 --> 05:42:22,870
tell us what you think. Umm,

5738
05:42:22,881 --> 05:42:24,976
although their thing was, here's what.

5739
05:42:24,977 --> 05:42:28,309
I can't really say what's coming,

5740
05:42:28,632 --> 05:42:31,171
I what's coming, that's,

5741
05:42:31,172 --> 05:42:33,846
umm, terrible. I don't know where you're going.

5742
05:42:33,847 --> 05:42:36,085
Umm,

5743
05:42:36,095 --> 05:42:40,002
there you're going. Yeah,

5744
05:42:40,003 --> 05:42:42,956
okay. Restarting these are Cutless. Close. Use them more back into the bottom of

5745
05:42:42,957 --> 05:42:45,088
my patient. So that's, yeah,

5746
05:42:45,089 --> 05:42:47,152
multiple shots. They've always seen their shots.

5747
05:42:47,153 --> 05:42:51,575
Umm. So I'm estimating,

5748
05:42:51,576 --> 05:42:55,562
this is, this is not a big hit for this and I have multiple

5749
05:42:56,239 --> 05:42:58,960
meetings with him about it. You umm,

5750
05:42:58,970 --> 05:43:03,945
there's plenty of estimating so that you can get a breakdown

5751
05:43:03,946 --> 05:43:07,105
vibe of it. Multiple different things.

5752
05:43:07,106 --> 05:43:10,829
I'm not sure about how we want to get. But what I asked is

5753
05:43:10,830 --> 05:43:12,895
in the, uh, estimate summary.

5754
05:43:12,896 --> 05:43:17,777
Great. You can get a summary drop at the top and choose Costco

5755
05:43:17,859 --> 05:43:20,387
and it'll get me over this and now I cost it.

5756
05:43:20,640 --> 05:43:25,183
Which, you don't really- I-I-I asked him there and I wanted to

5757
05:43:25,184 --> 05:43:29,536
have an option there to work category with some category.

5758
05:43:29,712 --> 05:43:32,869
and H, Indian Custom Peel,

5759
05:43:32,870 --> 05:43:35,518
but I need some. I didn't break down this. That's like, pfft,

5760
05:43:36,057 --> 05:43:38,760
pfft. See you. You Quiet,

5761
05:43:38,815 --> 05:43:41,208
it's like, I need, uhh,

5762
05:43:41,219 --> 05:43:44,370
I need a dollar or this building of that.

5763
05:43:44,371 --> 05:43:46,204
That's how I can say it. Good. . . . . . Yeah. .

5764
05:43:46,205 --> 05:43:49,331
. . and it's going to be able to do that?

5765
05:43:49,332 --> 05:43:53,214
You don't really actually have to wait doing that,

5766
05:43:53,215 --> 05:43:58,238
yeah. Yeah, that would be pretty interesting because

5767
05:43:58,239 --> 05:44:01,871
when you have to say, put it in active, building A in the EECI.

5768
05:44:01,872 --> 05:44:04,718
whatever. So, it's terrible there.

5769
05:44:04,719 --> 05:44:07,687
That's the one. That's the one. So, I should deal with 4.6 to 2.

5770
05:44:07,688 --> 05:44:09,911
I love it. Well.

5771
05:44:09,912 --> 05:44:12,308
Or, just, you know, say the D-SIS,

5772
05:44:12,309 --> 05:44:14,663
go back. Uh, you,

5773
05:44:14,704 --> 05:44:16,980
will be able to say nothing,

5774
05:44:16,981 --> 05:44:20,855
ships, or let's say- Nice and deep, which has never been a thing,

5775
05:44:20,856 --> 05:44:24,496
but that'll be an option just by a one for a long time,

5776
05:44:24,497 --> 05:44:29,181
and I'm really fascinated. Thank for your attention. Uhm,

5777
05:44:29,191 --> 05:44:33,864
we'll be able to attach documents on Loom's screen for your

5778
05:44:33,865 --> 05:44:36,341
share. Good. Uhm,

5779
05:44:36,352 --> 05:44:38,514
some of the numbers are b******. Can you access a bread over it?

5780
05:44:38,515 --> 05:44:40,570
Yes. Oh, no. Okay.

5781
05:44:42,851 --> 05:44:46,380
Thank you for going. You're going to be able to find the eyes from

5782
05:44:46,381 --> 05:44:48,918
you. She might get it if you want to. Nice.

5783
05:44:48,919 --> 05:44:53,387
us. I don't have any more more in them there.

5784
05:44:54,158 --> 05:44:58,077
I just feel like that's all I can do with everybody.

5785
05:44:58,078 --> 05:45:02,143
Yeah. Yes. I get stuck with every single one I've ever done.

5786
05:45:02,380 --> 05:45:05,044
Yeah. Oh, you got any of that?

5787
05:45:05,301 --> 05:45:07,550
Okay. it. Now I didn't,

5788
05:45:07,551 --> 05:45:10,704
uh, now I didn't, it's, uh,

5789
05:45:10,714 --> 05:45:14,086
I'm here to make a sin anyway,

5790
05:45:14,087 --> 05:45:16,911
so we have no- problem with it, as the way I've gotten in favor

5791
05:45:16,912 --> 05:45:19,764
of coming back. We've got a length,

5792
05:45:19,765 --> 05:45:21,965
a slice, and a little bit of 23rd make order.

5793
05:45:22,403 --> 05:45:24,779
We have a sin- So, So, the sin of the leg is going to

5794
05:45:24,780 --> 05:45:26,857
be all proper, but everywhere, you need to know that,

5795
05:45:26,858 --> 05:45:29,536
of course, you're wearing a QLQ next. So,

5796
05:45:29,537 --> 05:45:31,918
uh, for that. Well, you know,

5797
05:45:32,077 --> 05:45:34,805
they have a recession that works like it.

5798
05:45:34,806 --> 05:45:37,095
How should we be this, what should we be a lot of this,

5799
05:45:37,096 --> 05:45:39,141
and, uh, a bunch of stuff, so. Thanks for watching to see you to

5800
05:45:39,142 --> 05:45:41,663
get your vision friends. Yeah, through your own,

5801
05:45:41,812 --> 05:45:44,009
what the real world's thinking. Yeah.

5802
05:45:44,745 --> 05:45:46,829
Yeah, that is, I can care.

5803
05:45:46,830 --> 05:45:49,083
You know, you're interested in Davis, that's a perk that,

5804
05:45:49,084 --> 05:45:52,295
uh, I want to, uh, I'd follow you until I go,

5805
05:45:52,296 --> 05:45:54,911
I ask, have you ever been to the community? Yeah. Yeah. All right.

5806
05:45:54,912 --> 05:45:56,924
It's,

5807
05:45:56,925 --> 05:46:00,020
uh, I'd ask you to expand some confidence.

5808
05:46:00,021 --> 05:46:03,371
They didn't even have a box of nourishment playing better.

5809
05:46:03,372 --> 05:46:05,829
I was just, you know, all about Atlassian,

5810
05:46:05,830 --> 05:46:08,068
it's work, but, you know,

5811
05:46:08,069 --> 05:46:10,163
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

5812
05:46:10,164 --> 05:46:12,855
it's, it's. See ya! I'm about to, I don't know.

5813
05:46:13,485 --> 05:46:15,569
Yeah, absolutely. But, okay,

5814
05:46:15,570 --> 05:46:18,688
okay, okay, okay. I don't know how to say this,

5815
05:46:18,689 --> 05:46:23,880
I'm 17. 3 6 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8

5816
05:46:23,881 --> 05:46:27,491
That's what we're going to see.

5817
05:46:27,492 --> 05:46:31,943
We're going to send an order to you now to speak. It's okay.

5818
05:46:31,944 --> 05:46:35,531
It's faster. It's better to send it off.

5819
05:46:35,532 --> 05:46:38,566
Yeah, there we go.

5820
05:46:39,501 --> 05:46:42,643
They're going to send me in now. And uh.

5821
05:46:42,654 --> 05:46:44,919
That's it. How's that? I don't care.

5822
05:46:45,400 --> 05:46:48,992
Send me no more of a beating on the ground over the ground.

5823
05:46:49,270 --> 05:46:52,821
I'm going to be able to steer you to this. Cheers. And then they

5824
05:46:52,822 --> 05:46:57,136
went to that, uh, I conventionally Chicago for all the equipment.

5825
05:46:57,644 --> 05:46:59,651
That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

5826
05:46:59,652 --> 05:47:04,417
And, uh, we had, like, five parents of a fat attack and then spent

5827
05:47:04,418 --> 05:47:07,909
all this motor phone ever here looking at the equipment we were never- gonna

5828
05:47:07,910 --> 05:47:11,324
buy. And they're like, oh, it's kind of single waste.

5829
05:47:12,812 --> 05:47:15,080
Yeah, that was a waste, we did that was a waste,

5830
05:47:15,081 --> 05:47:17,383
we got into- Terrible mentions,

5831
05:47:17,384 --> 05:47:21,905
wouldn't have been a waste. I would have taken notes out of it and

5832
05:47:21,906 --> 05:47:27,647
tried to have a good tip when it- you. That was-

5833
05:47:27,648 --> 05:47:30,035
that was purely knowledge, that was truly, yeah.

5834
05:47:30,036 --> 05:47:34,466
Bye bye. Just, let's see if you got a serious buy,

5835
05:47:34,467 --> 05:47:37,004
not for some equipment, before you go into it.

5836
05:47:37,493 --> 05:47:39,856
And being a developer, and, uhm.

5837
05:47:39,857 --> 05:47:42,884
I'm like, that's really hard, we should never ever want,

5838
05:47:42,885 --> 05:47:45,113
we could get it.

5839
05:47:45,114 --> 05:47:48,121
Maybe. Hey. Yeah,

5840
05:47:48,332 --> 05:47:50,819
I used to send two people out for a year.

5841
05:47:52,555 --> 05:47:55,148
Like, yeah, I don't think so. Yeah.

5842
05:47:55,149 --> 05:47:59,556
. What you already do, not to wear a bottle of bitters,

5843
05:47:59,557 --> 05:48:01,752
can't see you anyway in there. Okay.

5844
05:48:02,223 --> 05:48:06,499
You better than you are shopping for a bunch of,

5845
05:48:06,902 --> 05:48:10,252
you know, starting to shop. You see every bite of it.

5846
05:48:11,039 --> 05:48:13,137
Yeah. Have a good night. Bye. So,

5847

I was all made up of that. I traveled to their place at the

5856
05:48:39,469 --> 05:48:42,262
end of it and then checked out. I'd walk with the program and we're

5857
05:48:42,263 --> 05:48:46,143
just, you know, simple. all the time. And then it fully wants his,

And, um, fair, you download from.

5866
05:49:08,233 --> 05:49:11,594
You don't think the structure is yours or it's not even their software.

5867
05:49:12,025 --> 05:49:14,139
It hurts, but it ain't okay. Okay.

5868
05:49:15,566 --> 05:49:18,319
Okay. Okay. So, what's the best way to weld this?

5869
05:49:18,415 --> 05:49:21,556
Yeah, I mean, check with any guy in the video, or if you check

5870
05:49:21,557 --> 05:49:25,719
me, what else I hate to do. Thank you so I want to do

5871
05:49:26,115 --> 05:49:28,918
anything like that. You know, I gave him a lot of that.

5872
05:49:29,250 --> 05:49:31,472
So, um, uhm, uhm,

5873
05:49:31,473 --> 05:49:35,284
uhm, ehm, ehm. leave torsion piece that we ran on on literally 12 to

5874
05:49:35,285 --> 05:49:38,238
12, 5, 16, it's two, it was a few problems,

5875
05:49:38,239 --> 05:49:40,456
but he wasn't that like, I'm sure he wasn't that much.

5876
05:49:40,457 --> 05:49:42,647
And it took 14 minutes to run,

5877
05:49:42,648 --> 05:49:45,046
uhm, sir. Since, uh,

5878
05:49:45,057 --> 05:49:47,563
congratulations to you guys, uhm,

5879
05:49:47,574 --> 05:49:51,434
we had to- We had 6B correctly,

5880
05:49:51,435 --> 05:49:55,271
uhm, 6B per cell, that we don't see the lapping sport.

5881
05:49:55,445 --> 05:49:59,282
We did a 40- so the R

5882
05:50:08,500 --> 05:50:12,094
You put the uhh, unfamiliar with it. Yeah, you put it,

5883
05:50:12,095 --> 05:50:12,493
yeah, it looks like a witch activity, right? You put it in there. There.

5884
05:50:12,616 --> 05:50:15,020
And the other thing is that computers won't,

5885
05:50:15,629 --> 05:50:17,734
won't be able to beat that and love it, but, well, let's go out

5886
05:50:17,735 --> 05:50:19,979
and get it. And then the other thing, uhm, the other thing,

5887
05:50:19,980 --> 05:50:22,575
uhm, the other side, yeah,

5888
05:50:22,576 --> 05:50:24,847
well, you're not necessarily in the station,

5889
05:50:24,848 --> 05:50:27,278
you're just able to track the other side of it.

5890
05:50:27,437 --> 05:50:29,733
So, uhm, bellow. You know, I don't have tools,

5891
05:50:30,527 --> 05:50:32,825
I don't have tools like something like that,

5892
05:50:33,321 --> 05:50:35,886
and, you know, wow, that's well there.

5893
05:50:36,371 --> 05:50:39,865
You want to- the other side, somebody's setting it up again,

5894
05:50:40,239 --> 05:50:43,097
and the one that I saw were brocheting,

5895
05:50:43,098 --> 05:50:47,826
so it broke. room. I'm saying the PC and this thing would well

5896
05:50:47,827 --> 05:50:50,964
do exactly what you're saying. Yeah. On the other side,

5897
05:50:51,170 --> 05:50:54,363
they're blooming the next PC. See you Yeah. And then,

5898
05:50:54,435 --> 05:50:58,000
yeah. And to be like 180 and start going on again.

5899
05:50:58,104 --> 05:51:00,239
So they, they, we,

5900
05:51:00,279 --> 05:51:03,559
we got. One step to start with.

5901
05:51:04,082 --> 05:51:07,851
We bought a single cell ring, and so it,

5902
05:51:07,852 --> 05:51:10,708
it was a 40th book. You have 40 foot bag of those in it.

5903
05:51:11,200 --> 05:51:13,416
And so, one piece was edited.

5904
05:51:13,780 --> 05:51:18,855
Then that was better pulled out, we made a of a real MediRoute.

5905
05:51:18,856 --> 05:51:23,382
Bigger, Ramon, London, and Travis is a 2-7,

5906
05:51:23,383 --> 05:51:26,133
so you got one of these here. Thank you. One piece at meter,

5907
05:51:26,134 --> 05:51:29,148
so off-wind me of this case, you're ever you're tacking up on this.

5908
05:51:29,730 --> 05:51:31,845
And then once done it, it gives you another structure.

5909
05:51:31,915 --> 05:51:35,755
Then we pull this left. And then start tacking the other up.

5910
05:51:36,973 --> 05:51:40,063
And to me, it wasn't working then. Because,

5911
05:51:40,502 --> 05:51:43,962
like, we, We would tack up, we'd have a bag,

5912
05:51:44,270 --> 05:51:47,576
and the beverage on this side, we would tack up on this side,

5913
05:51:47,577 --> 05:51:50,827
and it would fall as well. you And then bring the PC,

5914
05:51:51,116 --> 05:51:53,724
pull this piece out, bring it up and PC into it.

5915
05:51:54,014 --> 05:51:56,064
I didn't feel like it was worth an extra.

5916
05:51:56,065 --> 05:51:58,099
Thank you. Bye. $100,000,

5917
05:51:58,100 --> 05:52:00,656
you should be at another area for us to pack up. Yeah,

5918
05:52:01,007 --> 05:52:04,145
I'm just going to see what they look at. They sent it for work,

5919
05:52:04,146 --> 05:52:06,420
maybe about- You know,

5920
05:52:07,744 --> 05:52:11,939
five minutes of time to pull a piece out of another wheel.

5921
05:52:11,940 --> 05:52:14,923
Uh, uh, uhm. How many pieces were you in front of?

5922
05:52:14,924 --> 05:52:19,110
Um, so there are, uhm, like all those trunks or columns.

5923
05:52:19,111 --> 05:52:22,078
So did that, and wouldn't it do teach a lot of that until we

5924
05:52:22,079 --> 05:52:24,216
read the subject show? Umm,

5925
05:52:24,227 --> 05:52:26,440
we were getting about, well, we're getting columns a day.

5926
05:52:26,599 --> 05:52:29,121
Don't worry, shit, excuse me. Can we get columns and shit?

5927
05:52:29,122 --> 05:52:33,617
Uh, uh, uh, so. Can we know what you have to do?

5928
05:52:33,618 --> 05:52:36,414
How do we have to do?

5929
05:52:36,415 --> 05:52:39,765
Like, uh, 10... Uh, uh,

5930
05:52:39,766 --> 05:52:41,874
uh, I mean, that was really the redder,

5931
05:52:41,875 --> 05:52:44,419
most of the country people, so it's cost me a little bit.

5932
05:52:44,582 --> 05:52:46,718
So, okay. Yeah. Okay, so, so we had Seth and he's,

5933
05:52:46,719 --> 05:52:49,433
we're giving him room. Yeah. Tryna,

5934
05:52:49,654 --> 05:52:53,777
I got a video of it growing, but, You Yeah,

5935
05:52:53,778 --> 05:52:57,836
I was always just, how many pieces do you have to jump by and

5936
05:52:57,837 --> 05:53:00,702
cross them with a crystal set up for this community.

5937
05:53:00,703 --> 05:53:05,329
Thank Something all the time, okay. They would do the working without further building

5938
05:53:05,330 --> 05:53:09,136
their hand to pull over the machine. That's it.

5939
05:53:09,137 --> 05:53:11,534
So yeah,

5940
05:53:11,535 --> 05:53:14,349
it was, it was working like,

5941
05:53:14,350 --> 05:53:17,536
and I think we made like, I don't know what's coming up.

5942
05:53:17,537 --> 05:53:20,580
Since then, but I think we made like, 600,000 dollars for,

5943
05:53:20,581 --> 05:53:24,595
uhm, hang on.

5944
05:53:24,596 --> 05:53:30,294
So. That's it. That's southern work.

5945
05:53:32,289 --> 05:53:35,687
That's a good machine. Thank you. I think,

5946
05:53:35,725 --> 05:53:38,798
yeah, there's a fair and real options out there.

5947
05:53:38,799 --> 05:53:41,411
They're gonna be double.

5948
05:53:41,412 --> 05:53:44,396
I love it. It's a trip with the money,

5949
05:53:44,397 --> 05:53:48,448
too. And we were striving on all pieces so they lay out it and

5950
05:53:48,449 --> 05:53:53,153
fit up as nothing, you know. We took a job for Solar

5951
05:53:53,154 --> 05:53:55,475
Farm on some of us.

5952
05:53:55,476 --> 05:53:57,731
Alright.

5953
05:53:57,732 --> 05:54:02,995
And we had one of those winter machines.

5954
05:54:03,108 --> 05:54:05,771
Yeah. So,

5955
05:54:05,772 --> 05:54:09,807
And we had a table that rotated on this side so we could weld

5956
05:54:09,808 --> 05:54:11,833
on this side, weld on this side. Yeah.

5957
05:54:11,834 --> 05:54:14,317
And there was table on this side, weld on. This side,

5958
05:54:14,318 --> 05:54:16,904
not on this side. I think it got into a 6 ring,

5959
05:54:17,723 --> 05:54:22,693
a column of columns, but Yeah And,

5960
05:54:24,900 --> 05:54:29,789
you're literally for us in the, as the welding was so.

5961
05:54:29,790 --> 05:54:32,081
Go. Quick. Yeah.

5962
05:54:32,264 --> 05:54:35,653
And you really just had it done all your parts tax.

5963
05:54:36,753 --> 05:54:38,849
You know, everything had to get. . . And everywhere you go,

5964
05:54:39,124 --> 05:54:44,436
barely attacking it. But the biggest problem was that it was spinnicky,

5965
05:54:45,202 --> 05:54:47,782
but the piece had- . I had the exact same thing in the right

5966
05:54:48,072 --> 05:54:52,186
place. Yeah. And I hear that the vision system got better,

5967
05:54:52,839 --> 05:54:55,377
and so the vision- It wasn't there, it stopped.

5968
05:54:56,470 --> 05:54:58,610
Yeah, the ACT will do that, too,

5969
05:54:58,611 --> 05:55:02,116
until it's- . . . it scans and partially because it's actually- .

5970
05:55:02,117 --> 05:55:06,086
. it scans and partially at the pace of the bed that they don't

5971
05:55:06,733 --> 05:55:11,125
stop. Wow. Uh,

5972
05:55:11,136 --> 05:55:13,876
simple, flat, but right here is popped in and it's just,

5973
05:55:13,877 --> 05:55:16,714
it's scaring that wall and it can be in the tube,

5974
05:55:16,764 --> 05:55:19,534
so you don't have to change the size. I'm gonna read this a minute.

5975
05:55:20,097 --> 05:55:26,811
It makes it burning. Good morning. Not

5976
05:55:26,812 --> 05:55:31,811
bad.

5977
05:55:33,050 --> 05:55:35,821
Alright. Alright. So that thing with,

5978
05:55:35,822 --> 05:55:39,775
umm, we had one within the first month or two.

5979
05:55:39,778 --> 05:55:42,064
I mean, yeah, we were just going to pull down with that.

5980
05:55:42,065 --> 05:55:44,671
No. And that, uh, well with this,

5981
05:55:44,672 --> 05:55:47,502
uh, then it was going down the other side of somebody's birthday,

5982
05:55:47,503 --> 05:55:50,291
and it hurt me, but you don't all stop. And,

5983
05:55:49,983 --> 05:55:52,276
And that big carriage was going down,

5984
05:55:52,826 --> 05:55:56,168
and I'll stop, and cool, but shootin' over a puff.

5985
05:55:56,889 --> 05:55:59,191
And so I talk to him about, I'm like, yes,

5986
05:55:59,240 --> 05:56:02,159
we got a big problem. And if we got a lot of work in

5987
05:56:02,160 --> 05:56:04,910
this, uh, home, we're at it. And yes, we call him nuts.

5988
05:56:04,911 --> 05:56:07,340
So, very, very, very, probably that's it.

5989
05:56:07,737 --> 05:56:10,076
I have a flight. We looked. I have a tarantining.

5990
05:56:10,077 --> 05:56:12,811
I'll give you a list we can make in your place.

5991
05:56:12,812 --> 05:56:15,081
Uh, maybe they didn't want to like this. . . Absolutely.

5992
05:56:15,522 --> 05:56:17,919
It's, uh, very good experience. And I,

5993
05:56:17,920 --> 05:56:21,187
uh, got us back with it. I also want to say good ideas because

5994
05:56:21,188 --> 05:56:25,730
it's not only a real tanger. You just like when we first got,

5995
05:56:25,731 --> 05:56:27,969
we, we needed it so bad that we're like,

5996
05:56:27,970 --> 05:56:30,496
okay, we're okay. We just want to read it. So we're like.

5997
05:56:30,497 --> 05:56:34,115
I'm putting it up on a box for now. So this was before we

5998
05:56:34,469 --> 05:56:37,367
had the, before we had the regimes.

5999
05:56:37,583 --> 05:56:39,672
You're gonna have to rotate. It just take four times.

6000
05:56:39,970 --> 05:56:42,305
Yes, so it, it's always worth playing.

6001
05:56:42,444 --> 05:56:45,755
Sure. It's, uh, yeah, it would rotate four times.

6002
05:56:45,756 --> 05:56:48,645
So. So. Yeah, so you can do it right if you have a no-chader.

6003
05:56:48,646 --> 05:56:51,908
Yeah. Bitbucket, this was quite competitive.

6004
05:56:52,461 --> 05:56:54,611
So, but yeah, they will not be ready to hit.

6005
05:56:54,612 --> 05:56:57,122
I was to want that to, you and then what's the reason to,

6006
05:56:57,123 --> 05:56:59,281
yeah, you should work in, uh, on its own. So,

6007
05:56:59,282 --> 05:57:01,408
uhm, how much was that? Six hundred,

6008
05:57:01,409 --> 05:57:03,898
that one? Give us six hundred. A thousand, we're weak on it,

6009
05:57:03,899 --> 05:57:06,985
but I'm hearing it's eight, nine hundred thousand,

6010
05:57:06,986 --> 05:57:10,632
something like that. I'm very much ashamed to be by those.

6011
05:57:10,633 --> 05:57:12,386
You just give the full cost back. I love you.

6012
05:57:18,731 --> 05:57:21,572
I mean, I like clean, it was clean, it was pretty fancy.

6013
05:57:21,574 --> 05:57:26,361
Yeah. I think

6014
05:57:26,362 --> 05:57:29,145
I was close. You was concerned about it, it was more than really more

6015
05:57:29,146 --> 05:57:33,767
relevant. How easy was it going to be to

6016
05:57:33,768 --> 05:57:36,071
get lead?

6017
05:57:36,072 --> 05:57:38,910
Umm, the software into their software,

6018
05:57:38,911 --> 05:57:41,220
from detailing it with their software, else.

6019
05:57:42,428 --> 05:57:44,349
I didn't want to put some money on some- Thank you. I paid it

6020
05:57:44,350 --> 05:57:50,033
all just to do that, you know? And it was honestly

6021
05:57:50,034 --> 05:57:52,920
seamless. It's literally an extra- or an import.

6022
05:57:54,628 --> 05:57:58,152
Then it was a once in a while, that German public equipment sent me.

6023
05:57:58,666 --> 05:58:01,771
I'm like, do you guys stop? Get out of the shit in the US

6024
05:58:01,772 --> 05:58:07,700
in case something goes bad. I'm not here, I'm

6025
05:58:07,701 --> 05:58:09,801
ready for a good suit. I don't know. But they were awesome.

6026
05:58:09,802 --> 05:58:12,853
They were awesome.

6027
05:58:12,944 --> 05:58:18,794
They were awesome. Specifically. Cool. And

6028
05:58:18,795 --> 05:58:22,864
this was pre-COVID when I was looking at it. Welcome,

6029
05:58:22,865 --> 05:58:25,640
everybody.

6030
05:58:25,641 --> 05:58:28,327
All right. I'll see you Bye. Thanks, Josh. I feel like I'm a smart

6031
05:58:28,328 --> 05:58:30,721
person. I think he was in here with a practical worklistening.

6032
05:58:30,722 --> 05:58:32,886
Um, so I kind of wanted to be coming to the,

6033
05:58:32,887 --> 05:58:35,839
uh. Bye. Congrats on the planet,

6034
05:58:36,093 --> 05:58:39,301
you know, future production, the entire production work that I'm going to do is

6035
05:58:39,302 --> 05:58:41,927
so that it's important. I think that's been a really good example.

6036
05:58:41,928 --> 05:58:44,246
We'll go. Yeah, I mean, too. I bet,

6037
05:58:44,247 --> 05:58:46,341
uhm, I'm sure it makes the most work of bad,

6038
05:58:46,342 --> 05:58:48,475
but I'll be his bad. It's good to be bad.

6039
05:58:48,729 --> 05:58:53,541
Yeah, catch. See It's the liquid use and set up already

6040
05:58:53,542 --> 05:58:56,468
on it, and get it to have a set of the departments and stuff.

6041
05:58:56,708 --> 05:58:59,167
Yeah, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

6042
05:58:59,168 --> 05:59:01,743
I know what we've created and what we've created and what and what we've

6043
05:59:01,914 --> 05:59:02,644
and stuff.

6044
05:59:31,391 --> 05:59:36,391
So,

6045
05:59:39,169 --> 05:59:42,655
yeah. And then combed. And then,

6046
05:59:42,850 --> 05:59:45,065
Emily cuts off right in fit.

6047
05:59:45,419 --> 05:59:47,664
Well, combed semi. I'm D,

6048
05:59:47,789 --> 05:59:52,366
Trumpet, Stone, and Umsen in the Lane in the water control.

6049
05:59:52,598 --> 05:59:55,367
AC Adler is going to allow us slowly to see.

6050
05:59:55,368 --> 05:59:59,786
Thank Future. So that's where you can bail into the future.

6051
06:00:00,470 --> 06:00:03,340
Okay, what you've got next job is 50.

6052
06:00:03,341 --> 06:00:06,976
Good. Five hundred hours, or at least a pound for any medical.

6053
06:00:07,845 --> 06:00:09,885
Plug it in there for the eight year savings,

6054
06:00:09,886 --> 06:00:12,785
but you don't have it on there. . . So essentially,

6055
06:00:12,786 --> 06:00:16,342
is this a second form,

6056
06:00:16,490 --> 06:00:18,959
form of failure,

6057
06:00:18,960 --> 06:00:22,105
I guess? Thanks. Yeah, you'd have to have the job in later,

6058
06:00:22,106 --> 06:00:25,175
better. I don't know what we're doing here. Compass,

6059
06:00:25,176 --> 06:00:28,076
how does it know the resource was- We'll see Yeah,

6060
06:00:28,077 --> 06:00:33,285
it pulls up from estimating questions why it's so critical that the estimated

6061
06:00:33,286 --> 06:00:36,334
they use I know your case,

6062
06:00:36,335 --> 06:00:40,173
I know your look at that because the advantage of all those different departments

6063
06:00:40,174 --> 06:00:42,983
and then it goes to spread out. So,

6064
06:00:42,984 --> 06:00:45,212
uh, it's- it pulls it for this, and it's,

6065
06:00:45,213 --> 06:00:50,026
uh, and Bitbucket also clearly must somehow know how many people you have,

6066
06:00:50,027 --> 06:00:52,400
and it's, it's important. We're going to send it back.

6067
06:00:52,472 --> 06:00:54,771
Yeah, so they've got the resource to say that,

6068
06:00:54,772 --> 06:00:57,145
so I cut sauce out of those with the hours.

6069
06:00:57,146 --> 06:01:01,654
I Nice and we approach control

6070
06:01:01,655 --> 06:01:03,819
and then, uh, application maintenance.

6071
06:01:03,820 --> 06:01:08,256
. , uh...…igh,

6072
06:01:08,257 --> 06:01:11,405
you know. Wimb a workshop,

6073
06:01:11,406 --> 06:01:15,880
PTorch. That's what he said. . alright. .

6074
06:01:15,911 --> 06:01:19,536
of your shots. Any of the different work areas,

6075
06:01:19,537 --> 06:01:23,776
do we set up work areas? Go ahead. Okay. I share my video I'll

6076
06:01:23,777 --> 06:01:26,024
right. I'll just go. Okay. Done. Alright. So,

6077
06:01:26,239 --> 06:01:28,040
cool. Close this. And then, yeah, I can go to the other part of

6078
06:01:28,041 --> 06:01:30,280
the maintenance. tuned more.

6079
06:01:30,281 --> 06:01:33,894
And in just a few Okay. And we'll One of the things you're trying

6080
06:01:33,895 --> 06:01:36,288
to do is try to go on schedule five days,

6081
06:01:36,289 --> 06:01:40,031
uhm, and then, so.

6082
06:01:40,032 --> 06:01:43,059
You can essentially do that here,

6083
06:01:43,060 --> 06:01:48,071
so. Yeah, right.

6084
06:01:48,072 --> 06:01:52,313
I hear it like handling is set for 60 out of a week.

6085
06:01:53,222 --> 06:01:56,111
Then, cutsaw at under 60. Stay.

6086
06:01:56,112 --> 06:01:58,892
So, so, you, you can build that up here.

6087
06:01:58,893 --> 06:02:01,277
You don't know the booksheets that you want about that.

6088
06:02:01,858 --> 06:02:03,955
Yeah. In different materials.

6089
06:02:03,956 --> 06:02:08,225
So. Like, you can have, like,

6090
06:02:08,226 --> 06:02:10,992
a single, it happens in multiple ways.

6091
06:02:10,993 --> 06:02:13,508
You can do work here. Later. I have different ways,

6092
06:02:13,509 --> 06:02:16,518
like, oh, no shock, don't be scared. I was going to have to work

6093
06:02:16,519 --> 06:02:19,149
with a shock and pop, which plays the deal with us and the guy

6094
06:02:19,150 --> 06:02:21,838
that had to do. We'll see you in the next That's my capacity.

6095
06:02:22,409 --> 06:02:24,514
So, they do so in different ways.

6096
06:02:24,691 --> 06:02:29,211
So, if you guys real-time, I guess, the wanting. Thank you for it is,

6097
06:02:29,228 --> 06:02:33,477
it does really look at the hours that you have been working.

6098
06:02:33,493 --> 06:02:35,506
It's looking at pieces that are done.

6099
06:02:35,507 --> 06:02:37,878
you So, uhm,

6100
06:02:37,889 --> 06:02:40,810
where the rest closed after. So,

6101
06:02:41,056 --> 06:02:43,652
deciding to look at that. This, this video was on you,

6102
06:02:43,653 --> 06:02:47,299
look at it now. It's looking at the hours playing in first and year

6103
06:02:47,300 --> 06:02:49,885
capacity, but whatever you work is,

6104
06:02:49,886 --> 06:02:52,396
whatever you work is history.

6105
06:02:52,397 --> 06:02:54,950
. Just planning to work this kind of stuff.

6106
06:02:58,405 --> 06:03:00,431
So the plan is now to plan- Bye.

6107
06:03:00,432 --> 06:03:04,915
Plan is, it can be done by my diverse war opponents.

6108
06:03:04,916 --> 06:03:08,476
Yes. And you could, and you could. Thank you very much.

6109
06:03:08,477 --> 06:03:11,248
I said both, and it will not cut out between the two so you

6110
06:03:11,249 --> 06:03:15,055
can see that one. Yeah,

6111
06:03:15,056 --> 06:03:17,936
our intention in- And we'll see that,

6112
06:03:17,937 --> 06:03:22,762
essentially, with our work back into this,

6113
06:03:23,897 --> 06:03:28,158
we build- bill. We build this to populate the hours to be here,

6114
06:03:29,015 --> 06:03:32,084
and then go into the construction planner.

6115
06:03:32,085 --> 06:03:35,336
You can be like these for a time, if it's only about a week,

6116
06:03:35,507 --> 06:03:39,511
only to see. I'll re-essentially begin to use that,

6117
06:03:39,512 --> 06:03:42,193
uh, however, so there. Thank you. Yeah.

6118
06:03:42,194 --> 06:03:46,826
Hey, that's why I'm

6119
06:03:46,827 --> 06:03:51,507
gonna be, Really nice to get it

6120
06:03:51,508 --> 06:03:53,608
linked up to you.

6121
06:03:53,609 --> 06:03:56,716
That's my, uh, link up this link.

6122
06:03:56,717 --> 06:04:00,060
So there's an average just showed up and you're about somebody,

6123
06:04:00,281 --> 06:04:03,029
and it's more like somebody having to sit there and say,

6124
06:04:03,030 --> 06:04:05,527
well, what kind of split do I think this is. You know,

6125
06:04:05,628 --> 06:04:10,069
that's very beautiful. And what the toggle that says,

6126
06:04:10,341 --> 06:04:17,275
this is the likely job to land. Thank Yeah,

6127
06:04:17,276 --> 06:04:19,098
the way they built this, initially it was the only work that you had

6128
06:04:19,099 --> 06:04:21,107
released. release. It's,

6129
06:04:21,418 --> 06:04:25,160
sure. Now they've got to deal with works like they've got to leave this

6130
06:04:25,161 --> 06:04:27,857
job and unwinds me earlier. It's time to bring,

6131
06:04:28,210 --> 06:04:30,966
and then add. That's where Lisa's, and so I'll put that on the stage.

6132
06:04:30,967 --> 06:04:33,676
It'll still be better than we can plan for it.

6133
06:04:33,907 --> 06:04:37,865
But as you get Lisa's, it reduces. Be sure to subscribe to that plan

6134
06:04:37,866 --> 06:04:40,589
more, right? So it will take a bit of time,

6135
06:04:40,590 --> 06:04:43,489
which is a revolution there. So let's say you've got a,

6136
06:04:43,597 --> 06:04:45,698
you're released for a bit later. I'm gonna say,

6137
06:04:46,262 --> 06:04:49,136
you've got your land in the work, which you're the release step,

6138
06:04:49,137 --> 06:04:51,754
but it's coming in time, you wanna say,

6139
06:04:51,966 --> 06:04:56,847
if I can take this- Yeah, so you can put it in a

6140
06:04:56,848 --> 06:05:01,031
future job as a- Go.

6141
06:05:02,940 --> 06:05:05,685
And put it in there and say,

6142
06:05:05,686 --> 06:05:07,999
hey, what else is new for me here in that apartment? Yeah. It's gonna

6143
06:05:08,000 --> 06:05:10,627
be cool. it. . Let me have a look at that in an Microsoft

6144
06:05:10,628 --> 06:05:12,955
product. It's hanging fast. Yes,

6145
06:05:12,981 --> 06:05:16,050
it's hanging fast. Cause you're going ahead and schedule a lot of lighting and

6146
06:05:16,051 --> 06:05:19,430
into you. Level some and I'll level up everything.

6147
06:05:20,336 --> 06:05:22,400
And some more like that. Kill myself.

6148
06:05:22,401 --> 06:05:24,820
Yeah, this doesn't mean we don't have anything.

6149
06:05:24,821 --> 06:05:26,968
So it's like. It's not going to be like, okay, I can stay here

6150
06:05:27,023 --> 06:05:30,326
four times or four times when I pass it in my luncheon.

6151
06:05:30,681 --> 06:05:33,196
It's not going to level up all morning. It's going to be time.

6152
06:05:33,197 --> 06:05:35,461
for you to make those decisions for,

6153
06:05:35,462 --> 06:05:40,206
you know. So, which is good in a lot of ways,

6154
06:05:40,275 --> 06:05:44,719
but uh, ways. My role is always to take a lot of future and

6155
06:05:44,720 --> 06:05:47,864
easy work if it's hard working better. Think about it a bit more.

6156
06:05:47,865 --> 06:05:52,106
Yeah. I In this industry,

6157
06:05:52,107 --> 06:05:56,032
it's hard to say, okay, just let all this happen because everything works,

6158
06:05:56,033 --> 06:05:58,338
right? Let all this sh- tippet, yep,

6159
06:05:58,565 --> 06:06:02,274
so that. Now,

6160
06:06:02,275 --> 06:06:05,271
in this part, we need to be adjusted.

6161
06:06:05,272 --> 06:06:09,914
Just because when we set this up we know how you

6162
06:06:09,915 --> 06:06:13,391
have a different place to get a job.

6163
06:06:13,392 --> 06:06:16,957
But either of us having to use this at all,

6164
06:06:16,958 --> 06:06:19,954
or if we're pretty much done nothing,

6165
06:06:19,955 --> 06:06:25,515
and uh, we'll ever get that. So that's it. Yeah, that's what we're

6166
06:06:25,516 --> 06:06:27,557
doing. Definitely. So, I mean, we can run with it right now,

6167
06:06:27,558 --> 06:06:29,924
and then I'd say that, and then we'll smart get to- and then we

6168
06:06:29,925 --> 06:06:33,034
can kind of go through, uh, like, gambling,

6169
06:06:33,500 --> 06:06:36,051
I guess, $60 a week.

6170
06:06:36,229 --> 06:06:38,325
Ah, I mean- I mean,

6171
06:06:38,605 --> 06:06:41,716
I guess you're not handling a week.

6172
06:06:42,028 --> 06:06:44,996
Well, the channel is there too, it's over for that next video,

6173
06:06:44,997 --> 06:06:45,551
guys. That's it.

6174
06:06:52,151 --> 06:06:53,591
It's not like you're processing that handling session for a job, so it's quite-

6175
06:06:53,592 --> 06:06:55,972
I mean, to have that on the schedule, so.

6176
06:06:57,757 --> 06:07:02,302
But, for me, I only never looked at I was

6177
06:07:02,303 --> 06:07:06,097
like, handling, well, we'll get our people to do the stuff we're gonna have.

6178
06:07:06,098 --> 06:07:12,055
Yeah. Yeah. And

6179
06:07:12,056 --> 06:07:14,567
from Will, you know, we could always cut it. It was cutting,

6180
06:07:14,568 --> 06:07:17,744
and the soap not cutting, and was not even mal-hard either.

6181
06:07:17,745 --> 06:07:22,632
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,

6182
06:07:23,051 --> 06:07:26,504
go back to your workout, and you can bring your plan right up again

6183
06:07:26,505 --> 06:07:30,103
then. Good. Or you can say the right time to talk.

6184
06:07:30,104 --> 06:07:42,214
Look. Look. Yeah,

6185
06:07:42,326 --> 06:07:45,100
so the idea is we got a week back. A week here,

6186
06:07:45,228 --> 06:07:48,619
then you're able to pull these packages over a drop of them a week.

6187
06:07:49,152 --> 06:07:52,680
And when you do that, it's gonna break out of the- of the- hours

6188
06:07:52,693 --> 06:07:55,845
by the apartment, so you go to the apartment view,

6189
06:07:55,846 --> 06:07:58,784
which is up there next to a rig's workshop to form,

6190
06:07:58,968 --> 06:08:03,450
yeah, or that way. You might hit the little square and get it.

6191
06:08:05,966 --> 06:08:08,120
So now we're going to break that by the apartment view.

6192
06:08:08,121 --> 06:08:11,019
You here. You

6193
06:08:18,005 --> 06:08:21,630
look at them. You know what works on them day by day?

6194
06:08:21,909 --> 06:08:24,334
That's a week, a week over there,

6195
06:08:24,335 --> 06:08:26,687
yeah. Yeah. And then,

6196
06:08:26,843 --> 06:08:30,081
so in that week, there's the packages for cut saw,

6197
06:08:30,082 --> 06:08:33,419
packages for burn. And then you're like,

6198
06:08:33,420 --> 06:08:36,031
is this action? I'm not I can. And so, like, when you first drop

6199
06:08:36,032 --> 06:08:38,666
it into a week, it's probably gonna drop cut saw,

6200
06:08:39,006 --> 06:08:41,757
burn, everything all in the same week,

6201
06:08:41,758 --> 06:08:43,789
right? Okay, bye bye. Now that's nothing gonna happen. You gotta cut it before

6202
06:08:43,790 --> 06:08:46,639
you fit it. You gotta fit it before you right? So,

6203
06:08:46,953 --> 06:08:49,440
then you might be moving these packages around to say,

6204
06:08:49,441 --> 06:08:53,002
okay, cool, we're cutting it this week and burning it this week,

6205
06:08:53,003 --> 06:08:56,083
but fit well, it'll be next week. So, you pull those down into the

6206
06:08:56,084 --> 06:08:58,216
follow-up maker or something like that.

6207
06:08:58,217 --> 06:09:02,487
So, in project,

6208
06:09:02,488 --> 06:09:05,579
you can have same starter,

6209
06:09:05,718 --> 06:09:07,957
you know. . . and after it's finished our,

6210
06:09:07,958 --> 06:09:10,809
uh, uh, I'm not going to logic anything.

6211
06:09:11,726 --> 06:09:14,291
And that's that's a reference. I do. This is.

6212
06:09:14,292 --> 06:09:16,418
The game chart not going like that,

6213
06:09:16,419 --> 06:09:19,069
which there is a game chart not going in here,

6214
06:09:19,344 --> 06:09:22,176
but not, not this schedule.

6215
06:09:22,177 --> 06:09:24,891
This. This is, this is very,

6216
06:09:25,183 --> 06:09:29,176
very much, you have to think through what's known way of.

6217
06:09:29,177 --> 06:09:36,112
So. So, And it's not going to land a lot out for me.

6218
06:09:36,113 --> 06:09:38,291
So. Please, well, here it is. It's a very- Thank you.

6219
06:09:38,292 --> 06:09:42,994
It's an way of putting blocks and packages in different places.

6220
06:09:43,504 --> 06:09:45,584
And then if you fill the volume up,

6221
06:09:45,585 --> 06:09:48,211
you better- Move. Adjustment.

6222
06:09:48,212 --> 06:09:50,608
Adjustment. Yep. It is.

6223
06:09:50,609 --> 06:09:52,931
I think, project will be faster than that.

6224
06:09:52,932 --> 06:09:56,574
Well. Well, You're telling the disconnect from the,

6225
06:09:56,856 --> 06:10:01,466
from the data. So, this actually does work well when you,

6226
06:10:01,467 --> 06:10:04,162
when you start working. you with it, uhm,

6227
06:10:04,173 --> 06:10:07,045
especially I think the package is here, but I'm not there.

6228
06:10:07,564 --> 06:10:09,698
I don't think you're in movement of the rambling.

6229
06:10:09,699 --> 06:10:14,250
Okay. Yeah, sissy, the stuff we've been

6230
06:10:14,251 --> 06:10:18,316
having now, and it's, uh, a hundred and ten feet tall.

6231
06:10:18,317 --> 06:10:20,625
A whole lot of baggage, you know, two hundred,

6232
06:10:20,626 --> 06:10:23,173
uh, baggage. So, this TMC,

6233
06:10:23,174 --> 06:10:25,476
uhm, Phatree,

6234
06:10:25,477 --> 06:10:30,138
uhm. So, that one will be a

6235
06:10:30,139 --> 06:10:32,344
little bit more.

6236
06:10:32,345 --> 06:10:37,204
. . I And now I'm in progress with the release

6237
06:10:37,205 --> 06:10:40,195
of the shop, and Monday and next week we have to have it done

6238
06:10:40,196 --> 06:10:42,340
by 12. . .

6239
06:10:42,371 --> 06:10:45,050
The band is here because, yeah,

6240
06:10:45,051 --> 06:10:47,671
I might have to turn that now to another week, but I don't have

6241
06:10:47,672 --> 06:10:50,351
to build the project, but I don't have to be in the sandal.

6242
06:10:53,659 --> 06:10:54,573
I don't want to build the job help. I don't want to be able

6243
06:10:54,574 --> 06:10:57,543
to add on a bit of a hero. I don't want to do the

6244
06:10:57,544 --> 06:11:00,146
accepting. That's what it means. I don't want to be able to do a

6245
06:11:00,428 --> 06:11:02,599
Microsoft project, but it's like,

6246
06:11:02,600 --> 06:11:06,371
you know, that's a win. So, I want to do it.

6247
06:11:06,372 --> 06:11:08,496
So you're saying like 12th of January,

6248
06:11:08,497 --> 06:11:10,691
you have to be done? Mm-hmm.

6249
06:11:10,692 --> 06:11:14,356
So you're basically giving yourself 15 days from your eyes.

6250
06:11:14,357 --> 06:11:20,296
Plus, to produce $69,000.

6251
06:11:20,297 --> 06:11:23,000
Well, really, it's $2,200. Outers Yeah.

6252
06:11:23,348 --> 06:11:24,364
Yeah.

6253
06:11:28,816 --> 06:11:30,971
Pretty work here, you sense? Next.

6254
06:11:30,972 --> 06:11:33,381
And, uhm,

6255
06:11:33,391 --> 06:11:36,178
unless the work has justified over the beats.

6256
06:11:37,429 --> 06:11:40,191
So, you have a 14-night career. Yeah,

6257
06:11:40,192 --> 06:11:43,321
that's fine, you know, just chill. You've got 20-night career.

6258
06:11:44,254 --> 06:11:47,051
You've got beats over the bars. Always.

6259
06:11:47,052 --> 06:11:51,257
It's Let me have more.

6260
06:11:51,258 --> 06:11:53,699
Do you think that's hard for you to do? Do want someone around to

6261
06:11:53,700 --> 06:11:56,191
buy them? No, I think,

6262
06:11:56,283 --> 06:11:58,439
I think it'll be good. I think,

6263
06:11:58,440 --> 06:12:00,457
uh, I think it'll be,

6264
06:12:01,721 --> 06:12:05,151
is that a little bit big, uhm. . . because there will be other

6265
06:12:05,152 --> 06:12:08,937
products that we can be living So what tricks are we going to have

6266
06:12:08,938 --> 06:12:11,171

6267
06:12:11,172 --> 06:12:14,155

6292
06:13:49,979 --> 06:13:53,511
a on the United States for a couple of years.

So. So. Yeah, I'm going right down this porch now.

6300
06:14:16,343 --> 06:14:18,437

06:14:54,320 --> 06:14:57,192
eating our, saw it out,

6314
06:14:57,772 --> 06:14:59,416
put a number of guests in it.

6315
06:15:03,761 --> 06:15:07,067
So, thank you. It's all the stuff I've invested in. So, a lot of

6316
06:15:07,068 --> 06:15:09,784
work. . . A lot of our numbers that are right now,

6317
06:15:09,785 --> 06:15:11,915
they're marked by annual take-out.

6318
06:15:11,916 --> 06:15:15,431
This is my take to take-out to be an us.

6319
06:15:15,432 --> 06:15:18,980
For you to be treated with that, that means we need to do that

6320
06:15:19,218 --> 06:15:22,991
for us. And it really does really check the line on the next meeting

6321
06:15:22,992 --> 06:15:25,500
department. So what's going on with the job,

6322
06:15:25,501 --> 06:15:28,942
like the, uh, water treatment fund stuff.

6323
06:15:28,943 --> 06:15:31,456
We've got those guys. These are. Later.

6324
06:15:31,457 --> 06:15:34,487
We're making those up. The PD is your day and themselves.

6325
06:15:34,488 --> 06:15:37,514
Umm. For a picture that can be,

6326
06:15:38,066 --> 06:15:42,476
be on. One. and I'm going to work a video down to work a

6327
06:15:42,709 --> 06:15:45,781
video down. And I'm going to release that with most,

6328
06:15:45,782 --> 06:15:49,175
most of the day, it will be accurate. On the set of A and

6329
06:15:49,176 --> 06:15:52,682
B, handbrails and canopy with gravel,

6330
06:15:52,882 --> 06:15:55,451
yeah. Family nose, canopy, swaying rails. Thank you guys.

6331
06:15:55,452 --> 06:15:58,800
Feathers, Vents, Nendways,

6332
06:15:59,278 --> 06:16:02,423
and the P-E, or are they using Tecua? That's what you want. And that's

6333
06:16:02,424 --> 06:16:05,893
it I'll see you in a couple of days.

6334
06:16:05,894 --> 06:16:09,132
Which has been given with a spreadsheet or something. This is where a lot

6335
06:16:09,133 --> 06:16:12,144
of them are using previous data. Never. So,

6336
06:16:12,789 --> 06:16:16,276
so that was it. I wanted to believe we fabricated this,

6337
06:16:16,277 --> 06:16:18,684
uh, 36, 24, 36,

6338
06:16:18,685 --> 06:16:23,519
48. We've got, we've got so many of those that they don't,

6339
06:16:23,520 --> 06:16:26,700
well, we're going to throw 30 hours in the mirror,

6340
06:16:26,960 --> 06:16:30,437
in the mirror. And we're going to do with 1,500 bucks in the cost

6341
06:16:30,438 --> 06:16:32,567
of materials, and we need to go forward for this product.

6342
06:16:32,568 --> 06:16:35,711
Let me know in if you know,

6343
06:16:35,712 --> 06:16:38,163
it's really all very surprising to me, you know.

6344
06:16:39,613 --> 06:16:42,060
It's hard to make a lot of money,

6345
06:16:42,061 --> 06:16:46,606
but it's awesome, it's awesome. What? And they can wear yourself with

6346
06:16:46,607 --> 06:16:50,585
that. Especially if you don't show yourself what you get.

6347
06:16:50,586 --> 06:16:54,444
See, you know. Bye. Kids heard about the hard job,

6348
06:16:54,445 --> 06:16:58,976
so, uhm, I made my job of tics a whole bunch of

6349
06:16:58,977 --> 06:17:01,667
time. And it was 10, 100,000 of it,

6350
06:17:02,359 --> 06:17:04,810
yeah, you know, hoo-punch. I,

6351
06:17:05,012 --> 06:17:07,511
I get mad into three, five million dollars. God bless you.

6352
06:17:07,512 --> 06:17:10,329
And it's not, you know, it's not like,

6353
06:17:10,705 --> 06:17:13,747
how would you say? I don't,

6354
06:17:13,748 --> 06:17:16,010
that's what it was. It was under 100, 100,000, yeah.

6355
06:17:16,046 --> 06:17:20,253
Good. I'd better be 50% wasn't worth it. I think this is happy to

6356
06:17:20,254 --> 06:17:22,426
have it. Otherwise,

6357
06:17:22,427 --> 06:17:25,526
it's not worth the stroking. Okay. You're very little bit business.

6358
06:17:27,788 --> 06:17:30,532
You scratch some attention from your eyes and stuff like that.

6359
06:17:30,533 --> 06:17:32,776
Some of this stuff ain't happening. I think.

6360
06:17:32,777 --> 06:17:35,895
But,

6361
06:17:35,948 --> 06:17:38,892
long road despite these guys, I'm Jamie.

6362
06:17:38,893 --> 06:17:41,245
Okay. I know- Good.

6363
06:17:41,304 --> 06:17:44,274
A big after-grant plan or something if you're not wearing it.

6364
06:17:45,302 --> 06:17:48,240
Big as it will. Well, I just sent out a snipe right here.

6365
06:17:48,288 --> 06:17:50,999
Thank you guys. I the very plan. I can see that,

6366
06:17:51,000 --> 06:17:53,702
yeah. We're doing everything in bed, white and blue, and this and then I

6367
06:17:53,703 --> 06:17:55,936
got all that. That's the correct. That's good fun.

6368
06:17:55,937 --> 06:17:58,965
you I forgot what I was doing now,

6369
06:17:58,966 --> 06:18:03,560
so you can find me.

6370
06:18:03,561 --> 06:18:07,975
Okay. Anyhow, do more work. . . . Yeah,

6371
06:18:07,976 --> 06:18:12,096
well, we're supposed to be the, this shiny star attempt,

6372
06:18:12,097 --> 06:18:14,809
but for all the other, shops. So,

6373
06:18:15,099 --> 06:18:17,465
we're supposed to refine our tech budget and everything.

6374
06:18:17,466 --> 06:18:19,565
Atlassian, new tech budget.

6375
06:18:19,620 --> 06:18:21,880
I love you. You know it there?

6376
06:18:21,881 --> 06:18:23,922
I'd like the idea.

6377
06:18:23,923 --> 06:18:27,391
That makes sense. But,

6378
06:18:27,703 --> 06:18:31,716
me and Mark are an active liver. Remember. We're living more in S34,

6379
06:18:31,717 --> 06:18:34,716
MediRoute. And best.

6380
06:18:35,339 --> 06:18:38,658
And now. And now. And then they'd still get a random attack,

6381
06:18:38,659 --> 06:18:40,977
a stroke, and a lot of them. And I was doing,

6382
06:18:40,978 --> 06:18:43,041
like, we're doing a lot of snicker. And Joss,

6383
06:18:43,042 --> 06:18:45,131
I'm going to get through the tackle.

6384
06:18:49,867 --> 06:18:51,976
That's the, that's the thing. I mean, it gives you so much.

6385
06:18:51,977 --> 06:18:54,685
There's so many. You even, even with,

6386
06:18:54,686 --> 06:18:58,620
uhh, even with the stuff you get from the next level and if we're

6387
06:18:58,621 --> 06:19:01,216
doing any structural for work that you have in your experience.

6388
06:19:01,217 --> 06:19:05,199
and I mean,

6389
06:19:05,200 --> 06:19:07,215
one of our biggest constraints is,

6390
06:19:08,013 --> 06:19:12,450
I get all this big. See ya. Materials and then I have to do

6391
06:19:12,451 --> 06:19:16,752
those sub data process and then they come back in and then they can

6392
06:19:16,753 --> 06:19:21,894
fit in well. I've checked, but otherwise

6393
06:19:21,975 --> 06:19:24,069
anything of their names should murder,

6394
06:19:24,129 --> 06:19:27,946
point and aim. . . and they went to go to third inches where

6395
06:19:28,740 --> 06:19:31,222
they went to go to third and being more level high in the car.

6396
06:19:31,223 --> 06:19:33,371
Thank you very much.

6397
06:19:33,372 --> 06:19:36,628
I'm gonna go there for a minute. This is just,

6398
06:19:36,629 --> 06:19:40,064
take two, one, three, and thank you. So,

6399
06:19:41,019 --> 06:19:43,868
bye! Lotta, we'll find it to be done,

6400
06:19:44,090 --> 06:19:48,338
but I, I, I, I think you think that the tech is gonna help.

6401
06:19:48,339 --> 06:19:52,606
Umm. So I was worried about that and now listening.

6402
06:19:55,705 --> 06:19:57,768
Hi, Jobs. Hi, Hollywood. We'll you in the next minute?

6403
06:19:57,769 --> 06:19:59,962
Umm, yeah, yeah,

6404
06:19:59,988 --> 06:20:03,793
it's like, if I really thought I was going to attack,

6405
06:20:03,794 --> 06:20:05,856
I'd get, went big job. Go! House.

6406
06:20:06,517 --> 06:20:08,852
They've got nothing to do with it.

6407
06:20:09,225 --> 06:20:11,555
I'm just going to buy, uh,

6408
06:20:11,566 --> 06:20:16,727
finally. I'm just going to shut the amount. Yeah. Don't right.

6409
06:20:16,728 --> 06:20:18,819
We will. Go.

6410
06:20:18,996 --> 06:20:22,426
Go. Be on and this work over here.

6411
06:20:22,427 --> 06:20:24,420
We're go there and we're going to do a little bit of well in

6412
06:20:24,421 --> 06:20:26,581
that here. Send the tag now against.

6413
06:20:27,932 --> 06:20:30,120
Okay, now that I'm going to go, and I'm going to- in a sense

6414
06:20:30,121 --> 06:20:33,639
that there's hexagonal field. Alright,

6415
06:20:33,640 --> 06:20:36,267
and I say, okay, in hexagonal field work,

6416
06:20:36,939 --> 06:20:39,215
we're seeing- I mean,

6417
06:20:39,216 --> 06:20:42,191
package is bad. There's this month,

6418
06:20:42,192 --> 06:20:46,360
uh, let's grab the work, uh, those I if we have any packages and

6419
06:20:46,361 --> 06:20:48,533
software. Yeah.

6420
06:20:49,422 --> 06:20:52,400
There's the other one that said, there's no other stuff before we gotta have

6421
06:20:52,401 --> 06:20:55,379
the equipment do that. You're in. It's actually going to be self-dortical.

6422
06:20:55,468 --> 06:20:58,148
Right. And if you haven't been on it for yourself,

6423
06:20:58,149 --> 06:21:00,220
I think we're gonna buy a certain notion.

6424
06:21:00,756 --> 06:21:03,028
I'm curious. Yeah. Alright, I'm curious.

6425
06:21:05,061 --> 06:21:08,033
I would just look at it,

6426
06:21:08,034 --> 06:21:10,821
what we know. I would do a- You know,

6427
06:21:10,822 --> 06:21:15,369
nobody really analyzes. Until Jack gave you just also analyzing,

6428
06:21:15,401 --> 06:21:17,891
that's why I knew these things because he's told me.

6429
06:21:17,892 --> 06:21:22,428
But I think Chris and Jira kind of were not

6430
06:21:22,429 --> 06:21:25,318
only winning 4% but they didn't really know the plays.

6431
06:21:25,319 --> 06:21:29,311
All guys. And so now the next thing is,

6432
06:21:29,312 --> 06:21:31,859
we need to scatter on this. What are we winning and what are we

6433
06:21:31,860 --> 06:21:33,971
losing? Or are we losing?

6434
06:21:33,972 --> 06:21:37,042
I a lot of the stuff that we should add a couple of dollars

6435
06:21:37,043 --> 06:21:39,756
in equipment to win more of that.

6436
06:21:40,032 --> 06:21:45,503
Yeah, I'm sure. Thank you. And I think stepping into the world of capital

6437
06:21:45,504 --> 06:21:48,053
is, like, three steps away.

6438
06:21:48,999 --> 06:21:51,451
At first we gotta say, Why is that? There,

6439
06:21:51,561 --> 06:21:54,396
there, there are many of them back to the job because the time has

6440
06:21:54,397 --> 06:21:57,574
been scraped in the, in the higher proper margins.

6441
06:21:57,575 --> 06:22:02,121
You think it's the other companies betting it hard to be able to

6442
06:22:02,122 --> 06:22:04,824
find who can cram it the other way. Could it be on front of

6443
06:22:04,825 --> 06:22:09,543
you to do different places? . . I think

6444
06:22:09,544 --> 06:22:11,446
that's what they- That's the strategy. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. The problem is,

6445
06:22:11,447 --> 06:22:13,504
is all the other places are actually busy. Yeah.

6446
06:22:13,505 --> 06:22:16,740
Get it. Cuz they're getting scared, they got to stay in the game too.

6447
06:22:17,509 --> 06:22:19,252
Cuz I really have to steal, but I don't know if I have to

6448
06:22:19,253 --> 06:22:21,528
be busy at the moment. Hey, uh,

6449
06:22:21,539 --> 06:22:23,746
bad luck. Bye I'm crazy, nice obviously I'm a bad guy,

6450
06:22:23,747 --> 06:22:26,460
I'm bit crazy. I'm just feeling welcome here being like,

6451
06:22:26,461 --> 06:22:29,888
I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy,

6452
06:22:29,889 --> 06:22:33,797
I'm a bad guy, you know I'm a bad guy,

6453
06:22:34,286 --> 06:22:39,474
you and all I'm not I'm

6454
06:22:39,475 --> 06:22:42,281
not better at a day than Disney radio.

6455
06:22:43,044 --> 06:22:45,542
Yeah. Thank you very much.

6456
06:22:45,543 --> 06:22:47,925
Oh, thank you. . I said my case and we seized that a little

6457
06:22:47,926 --> 06:22:50,575
bit of it. I think that's it this year. Yeah.

6458
06:22:50,576 --> 06:22:54,371
I got it. Thank you.

6459
06:22:54,372 --> 06:22:56,408
I'm gonna try to finish this year. So,

6460
06:22:56,481 --> 06:22:58,700
he said let's say they made a job in fact,

6461
06:22:58,701 --> 06:23:01,494
uh, moving and follow that stuff up.

6462
06:23:01,578 --> 06:23:04,783
Yeah, we're gonna do it. The release date has not fell over in the

6463
06:23:04,784 --> 06:23:08,121
next year. I know, but they got a certain portion of work that's been

6464
06:23:08,122 --> 06:23:10,285
done by March. Marching? Good.

6465
06:23:10,286 --> 06:23:13,072
Good. So the following year, 22,

6466
06:23:13,073 --> 06:23:15,267
27, 27, oh,

6467
06:23:15,370 --> 06:23:18,491
this is way in the future. Yeah. Last Last little girl.

6468
06:23:18,492 --> 06:23:21,336
Last girl. . . And everybody else is not. But if you look at

6469
06:23:21,337 --> 06:23:24,108
the schedule, so they can't do it good.

6470
06:23:24,458 --> 06:23:29,050
That's why I didn't do it quite. Bye. If I have a standard

6471
06:23:29,789 --> 06:23:32,459
team-minded company, it's not big enough. Maybe they are.

6472
06:23:32,783 --> 06:23:35,130
Yes, if it's near and halfway. Thanks. So, I would do so.

6473
06:23:35,131 --> 06:23:37,273
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

6474
06:23:37,434 --> 06:23:39,897
Yeah. I think they are maybe a little more out of my head,

6475
06:23:39,898 --> 06:23:41,923
and they are maybe out. They are a little bit confusing that this is

6476
06:23:41,924 --> 06:23:45,090
more confusing. . . This March. It has worked for next March,

6477
06:23:45,091 --> 06:23:48,025
and it happened to the government in the next November.

6478
06:23:49,342 --> 06:23:52,933
That's why you only have really much. It's about 7,000 Suns.

6479
06:23:54,105 --> 06:23:56,419
It is from time it's then. It's not.

6480
06:23:56,420 --> 06:23:58,691
Okay.

6481
06:23:58,692 --> 06:24:00,898
It's having the parts of the kid. They're not going to go,

6482
06:24:00,899 --> 06:24:03,105
it's just going to make the member. It's going to be fine.

6483
06:24:03,106 --> 06:24:05,540
So it's a still very tight fabrication.

6484
06:24:05,799 --> 06:24:09,910
So that's why it's- They're making We're going to probably get- We really can't.

6485
06:24:10,291 --> 06:24:13,113
And the back of the skull of work, back of his work,

6486
06:24:13,114 --> 06:24:16,610
the right tool. You work back of his hip and back.

6487
06:24:16,611 --> 06:24:22,811
Staying on house is what I expect. Wait. Is that what's-

6488
06:24:22,812 --> 06:24:25,884
I want you to see your own. I mean,

6489
06:24:26,157 --> 06:24:30,164
I think you should have just run, but what's the- I to do a

6490
06:24:30,165 --> 06:24:31,922
little bit more for I'm going to and do it. I guess I can

6491
06:24:31,923 --> 06:24:34,727
make a question for like, on future work,

6492
06:24:34,728 --> 06:24:36,907
because session roll is,

6493
06:24:36,908 --> 06:24:42,497
um. Bye Chris

6494
06:24:42,498 --> 06:24:45,690
B. wants us, and covens,

6495
06:24:46,154 --> 06:24:48,346
too. You. Be able to,

6496
06:24:48,347 --> 06:24:53,263
you know, hungry. We've got a project that we

6497
06:24:53,264 --> 06:24:55,511
haven't worried. This is all the work we have.

6498
06:24:55,512 --> 06:24:58,256
Backed in the shop and it's scheduled out, and we got a new project

6499
06:24:58,257 --> 06:25:02,288
ordered, and we want to try and plug that one in the other system.

6500
06:25:02,627 --> 06:25:04,957
Or. All right. Even theoretical,

6501
06:25:04,958 --> 06:25:09,717
something that's not awarded, but we've got potential this many hours,

6502
06:25:10,244 --> 06:25:12,696
how to plug that. You kind of stuff in.

6503
06:25:13,135 --> 06:25:17,641
So, um, it would be a bit of our considerably

6504
06:25:17,642 --> 06:25:21,276
start to have me. Mm-hmm. Shob more in here.

6505
06:25:21,904 --> 06:25:24,187
And, something that's not,

6506
06:25:24,207 --> 06:25:27,551
it's just gonna money, it's just the most of these fake-out-the-jobs in the world.

6507
06:25:27,552 --> 06:25:29,777
Yeah, we're not, we might even have,

6508
06:25:29,778 --> 06:25:32,452
uh, fake-job that's,

6509
06:25:32,453 --> 06:25:34,503
you know, like, almost, I said,

6510
06:25:34,504 --> 06:25:36,858
you can plug in. Thank you. I don't see it as a body.

6511
06:25:36,859 --> 06:25:39,220
Yeah, I said one.

6512
06:25:39,221 --> 06:25:41,438
So, if it's within tech, uh,

6513
06:25:41,449 --> 06:25:44,503
this is the production line. You're not- I got a big chart,

6514
06:25:44,504 --> 06:25:46,664
that is a given me. Are they a main difference?

6515
06:25:46,796 --> 06:25:48,882
No. Uh, no, no,

6516
06:25:48,883 --> 06:25:51,481
no. So, I'm going to do that and then I'm going to do something.

6517
06:25:51,482 --> 06:25:54,331
you I'm to do that.

6518
06:25:54,332 --> 06:25:59,089
There's a phase. Will not want to get under and consider something

6519
06:25:59,090 --> 06:26:02,075
else. the There is a production schedule.

6520
06:26:02,233 --> 06:26:06,248
A little to the progress. Yeah. Umm,

6521
06:26:06,259 --> 06:26:08,555
that could be. You run as well.

6522
06:26:09,900 --> 06:26:12,955
So there's a big thing on just a more detailed and broad one.

6523
06:26:13,501 --> 06:26:15,551
And some people just want to be. See Bye.

6524
06:26:15,552 --> 06:26:19,912
I think we can look at that production scenario,

6525
06:26:19,913 --> 06:26:23,233
right? Yeah. So this thing only runs a week.

6526
06:26:23,234 --> 06:26:26,034
I'm going to say exactly. I think you can't do my own thing right

6527
06:26:26,272 --> 06:26:28,625
now. You guys already know. Yeah,

6528
06:26:28,626 --> 06:26:30,798
but you need to go over it. Yeah.

6529
06:26:30,799 --> 06:26:34,284
Yeah. Only one week to show it,

6530
06:26:34,285 --> 06:26:37,910
because there's so many, uh, guys. He's growing bad and we'll see you in

6531
06:26:37,911 --> 06:26:44,672
the other weeks. So. So, let's Yeah.

6532
06:26:44,673 --> 06:26:47,920
Yeah.

6533
06:26:47,921 --> 06:26:50,341
Y'allen it. So, yeah,

6534
06:26:50,342 --> 06:26:52,958
in the slightest one then you see there's two other,

6535
06:26:53,594 --> 06:26:55,760
you know, there's a can't chart one then no,

6536
06:26:56,140 --> 06:26:58,877
the- Come on. Project, schedule, all these opinions are,

6537
06:26:58,878 --> 06:27:02,750
umm, it's ever been a life of self-prompting,

6538
06:27:03,086 --> 06:27:05,434
like me. Bye. You know what?

6539
06:27:05,435 --> 06:27:08,119
It's right here. Yeah, we're a little bit, it's really right here.

6540
06:27:08,120 --> 06:27:11,440
Yeah. Oh, okay, I see. Yeah. We'll you in minute.

6541
06:27:12,561 --> 06:27:17,420
So, now, this can automatically build

6542
06:27:17,421 --> 06:27:20,531
a production scale. So. I love you.

6543
06:27:20,532 --> 06:27:24,375
But one, go to the drop down at the top, and go to production

6544
06:27:24,376 --> 06:27:29,536
scale. And, sure. Good.

6545
06:27:29,537 --> 06:27:32,516
Now,

6546
06:27:32,517 --> 06:27:35,123
then we'll get started at the research this year,

6547
06:27:35,124 --> 06:27:40,053
but, and then

6548
06:27:40,054 --> 06:27:43,068
just go further away. Uh,

6549
06:27:43,079 --> 06:27:45,481
so this is the product..

6550
06:27:45,482 --> 06:27:48,123
You actually stand with this link to the project.

6551
06:27:48,188 --> 06:27:53,078
Basically, it puts it out here and then you can scroll out to

6552
06:27:53,079 --> 06:27:57,477
the right. You see week by week, you've got a concacity,

6553
06:27:57,507 --> 06:28:00,687
like, first, a burn table, that's another 20 hour capacity.

6554
06:28:00,876 --> 06:28:03,014
Let's meet. I've never seen this really,

6555
06:28:03,015 --> 06:28:05,310
this is pretty cool. I mean,

6556
06:28:05,311 --> 06:28:09,428
so, this is, it's not a productive schedule for your watch.

6557
06:28:09,429 --> 06:28:11,907
Yeah. But I'm just going to confine area,

6558
06:28:11,908 --> 06:28:14,482
um, see, my head, cut area, burn area,

6559
06:28:14,483 --> 06:28:16,540
and all that. It's just kind of what we had over the years.

6560
06:28:16,541 --> 06:28:19,093
Are you ready home? I just wanted to organize it.

6561
06:28:19,094 --> 06:28:22,412
It's been a little bit more time. It's been a little bit worth it

6562
06:28:22,413 --> 06:28:26,138
with it. Yeah, it's cool. But this pandoon project sk- Digital.

6563
06:28:27,006 --> 06:28:29,356
This pretty much just creates itself.

6564
06:28:29,435 --> 06:28:32,661
It sprays the house out even easily for a long job.

6565
06:28:32,662 --> 06:28:35,066
problem. Then for all jobs. Okay.

6566
06:28:36,012 --> 06:28:38,237
We have to live for one, uh, but yeah.

6567
06:28:38,238 --> 06:28:41,591
Okay. Soon. Can you put a job in here then?

6568
06:28:41,592 --> 06:28:45,419
If you want to say hello. Yeah. Let's do,

6569
06:28:45,420 --> 06:28:49,044
like, a good option. Right.

6570
06:28:49,045 --> 06:28:52,407
I think, uh, it was early when I, That won't just be where it

6571
06:28:52,408 --> 06:28:55,369
said flat saw. And then it might open up,

6572
06:28:55,370 --> 06:28:57,436
or open up, open up, open up, open up, open open up,

6573
06:28:57,437 --> 06:28:59,798
open up. Which I wouldn't want.

6574
06:28:59,997 --> 06:29:03,104
Now there's all the jobs that are contributing to the welding guide source.

6575
06:29:03,105 --> 06:29:06,440
And let's say you haven't been hours. I'll stay over.

6576
06:29:06,441 --> 06:29:09,712
Before we get a great job. Okay, each week is just all right.

6577
06:29:09,713 --> 06:29:14,591
Let's say I'm, uh, these guys are running the sk-

6578
06:29:18,160 --> 06:29:20,653
I'm using this board. I'm sitting, wherever I'm sitting,

6579
06:29:20,654 --> 06:29:24,287
and I don't wanna, uh, point guys. Thanks. Umm.

6580
06:29:24,298 --> 06:29:27,550
And I had test challenges in the best of their universe.

6581
06:29:27,551 --> 06:29:30,360
Uhm, if you put hours and stuff.

6582
06:29:30,361 --> 06:29:35,863
that's what I'm saying. But you can do a, you can do a umm.

6583
06:29:38,591 --> 06:29:42,036
like, I used to put it in a fake job that,

6584
06:29:42,721 --> 06:29:46,059
I just had it in a job that said, umm,

6585
06:29:46,070 --> 06:29:49,418
whatever. It was like, umm,

6586
06:29:49,428 --> 06:29:52,160
I think I call it a disseminating or something like that,

6587
06:29:52,487 --> 06:29:56,017
and I might have, You It's a lot of times in the state of

6588
06:29:56,018 --> 06:29:58,568
it, we're going to be judging what I think we might be at,

6589
06:29:58,729 --> 06:30:01,046
but I'm still not even asking what we're going to do.

6590
06:30:01,047 --> 06:30:03,879
But when these guys spin their mind, ,and if I see the schedule,

6591
06:30:03,880 --> 06:30:07,032
... yeah, that I mean most of them are just sitting worried.

6592
06:30:07,033 --> 06:30:09,047
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

6593
06:30:09,048 --> 06:30:11,803
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm kidding, I can send you for a play,

6594
06:30:11,804 --> 06:30:14,935
you know what? It's your name, they just won't approve that because you don't

6595
06:30:14,936 --> 06:30:18,392
want to. It's not like people can drop anything to leave for two minutes.

6596
06:30:18,393 --> 06:30:20,594
Let's go. Alright, go drop it in, you'll see what happens,

6597
06:30:20,595 --> 06:30:23,222
then you'll pull it out, right? Yeah, boy, let me give you this one,

6598
06:30:23,223 --> 06:30:25,823
when I drop it into your, your boss calls you.

6599
06:30:26,412 --> 06:30:28,489
and If you walk away and you forgot that you did it,

6600
06:30:28,490 --> 06:30:31,658
this guy's doing my most sketch, I'm just gonna tense it up.

6601
06:30:31,659 --> 06:30:34,114
Can you say, oh, I don't even want these charts?

6602
06:30:34,210 --> 06:30:36,687
That's good. I mean,

6603
06:30:36,688 --> 06:30:39,239
I think you said,

6604
06:30:39,240 --> 06:30:42,289
yeah, I don't want those. We'll just have one next time.

6605
06:30:42,290 --> 06:30:42,611
Yeah, we'll be sure not to know if that makes sense. Yeah, I mean.

6606
06:30:42,612 --> 06:30:45,879
I don't have my own schedule because not the schedule never wanted me to

6607
06:30:45,880 --> 06:30:47,968
mess with the master schedule.

6608
06:30:48,087 --> 06:30:50,651
Yeah, this is time to the project schedule.

6609
06:30:50,652 --> 06:30:53,906
The project schedule is each individual project,

6610
06:30:53,907 --> 06:30:57,421
right? Yep. And then the first one we're really looking at,

6611
06:30:57,422 --> 06:30:59,446
what's that called? So,

6612
06:30:59,447 --> 06:31:02,059
the production planer,

6613
06:31:02,060 --> 06:31:04,405
production planer. Yeah. So basically,

6614
06:31:04,406 --> 06:31:09,094
please, please, please give a wha- much more five nights greater

6615
06:31:09,095 --> 06:31:11,694
than if you want blue. In the production planer,

6616
06:31:11,695 --> 06:31:13,580
I don't think I'd use that. I should use this. Did YouTube? This one.

6617
06:31:13,581 --> 06:31:16,660
And thanks. They,

6618
06:31:16,832 --> 06:31:20,413
they had, they had this for years.

6619
06:31:21,098 --> 06:31:23,293
And when they were wanting the production plan in their life.

6620
06:31:23,294 --> 06:31:27,012
Bye. Wow, you got this for five minutes.

6621
06:31:27,013 --> 06:31:30,278
Yeah. I like that because I don't know how to, uhm,

6622
06:31:30,288 --> 06:31:32,980
this will spot it from where s- Shops. Yeah, I do think so,

6623
06:31:32,981 --> 06:31:34,984
Jira. It says, what was that to be called? Yeah,

6624
06:31:34,985 --> 06:31:37,063
it said. Yeah, right, yeah,

6625
06:31:37,096 --> 06:31:39,505
yeah. Or Microsoft, right? Yeah.

6626
06:31:39,239 --> 06:31:42,249
Yeah! Yeah. I like this.

6627
06:31:42,654 --> 06:31:46,665
And this thing has the ability to do a start,

6628
06:31:46,666 --> 06:31:50,449
start, or pick. Finish to start this particular program just like,

6629
06:31:50,600 --> 06:31:53,424
you have a surprise. Yep. Yeah, I like this.

6630
06:31:54,183 --> 06:31:59,196
That wouldn't be good. Thank and you can put total available hours

6631
06:31:59,197 --> 06:32:01,630
if you want it. And then, somehow,

6632
06:32:01,631 --> 06:32:03,665
I'm gonna tap the link. Thank you. I. Be. She.

6633
06:32:03,666 --> 06:32:06,755
Examine hours for all the jobs. There are two weeks from now and here's

6634
06:32:06,756 --> 06:32:09,722
how many hours of bed. Okay,

6635
06:32:09,723 --> 06:32:13,783
I'm sure. We're at Moaburger, but eh. Yeah. And one of the people that

6636
06:32:13,784 --> 06:32:17,854
I'm saying, you put this job for vloggers.

6637
06:32:17,881 --> 06:32:20,115
Yeah. And you have asthma. Backs,

6638
06:32:20,428 --> 06:32:23,105
it'll do what you think you need for it. It's just gonna fly.

6639
06:32:23,106 --> 06:32:26,552
Sure. Like it even, right? But she didn't have to get me a note

6640
06:32:26,553 --> 06:32:29,921
of that in April, especially- and then I'll move 500 hours under the first

6641
06:32:29,922 --> 06:32:32,986
week that I'll spill it out to a regular time. And you could buy

6642
06:32:32,987 --> 06:32:35,034
it out of this every week if you're thinking so I'll get in the

6643
06:32:35,035 --> 06:32:37,819
office. Push that. Yup. Yup.

6644
06:32:38,109 --> 06:32:40,665
And, you know, I'm like,

6645
06:32:40,666 --> 06:32:43,515
I don't know what you got.

6646
06:32:43,516 --> 06:32:46,459
you You guys are already doing what things you've done for this.

6647
06:32:46,873 --> 06:32:50,073
You're like, I don't want any of the scale. First of all,

6648
06:32:50,074 --> 06:32:54,469
I'm wondering if you can use this. I just wanted to see if it

6649
06:32:54,470 --> 06:32:57,702
would be better. But we're not using it,

6650
06:32:57,703 --> 06:33:01,587
right? Uh. Bye I'm not getting it,

6651
06:33:01,648 --> 06:33:05,022
yes or no. We right now there's only a couple weeks through the job,

6652
06:33:05,023 --> 06:33:07,691
so there's not really a reason. I'm gonna strike Bitbucket.

6653
06:33:07,692 --> 06:33:10,268
I'm wondering, but, yeah, when you've been really busy,

6654
06:33:10,775 --> 06:33:13,342
it's like one or two months. But the problem is,

6655
06:33:13,343 --> 06:33:15,736
if I'm really busy, it's, uh, home-like.

6656
06:33:15,737 --> 06:33:18,687
. . . 30 tiny packages that are going to be in there.

6657
06:33:18,688 --> 06:33:22,214
The total already has got it, so it takes me longer to set up

6658
06:33:22,215 --> 06:33:24,756
this 5 minutes. And do all this,

6659
06:33:24,757 --> 06:33:27,267
and it does, basically, 4 to 8 minutes,

6660
06:33:27,268 --> 06:33:29,287
cause it in the shot. Do you mind that case,

6661
06:33:29,288 --> 06:33:31,756
if one number be easier because it's,

6662
06:33:31,757 --> 06:33:34,329
It just has a word package bag,

6663
06:33:34,330 --> 06:33:36,971
uhh. It used to be 50 guys, I hear it down,

6664
06:33:36,972 --> 06:33:39,368
there's 20. So, what do you get,

6665
06:33:39,369 --> 06:33:43,079
50? If you have two or three months of work,

6666
06:33:43,080 --> 06:33:45,729
back that. Yeah. So,

6667
06:33:45,730 --> 06:33:47,771
the time is like that, it's gonna be really useful. So,

6668
06:33:47,772 --> 06:33:50,453
You have a little band, I shouldn't.

6669
06:33:51,101 --> 06:33:57,244
Yeah, that's gonna work anyway. Alright. Thank

6670
06:33:58,712 --> 06:34:00,774
you for having me,

6671
06:34:00,887 --> 06:34:03,161
thank you for having me with me,

6672
06:34:03,162 --> 06:34:07,796
like, this, to me, yeah. Yeah. What we use depends on what you try

6673
06:34:07,797 --> 06:34:11,376
to accomplish, yeah. Uh, if it's just,

6674
06:34:11,377 --> 06:34:14,338
I need to be able to learn this. . . I've seen two months

6675
06:34:14,339 --> 06:34:18,887
ago when I had my whole work job job and this and

6676
06:34:18,888 --> 06:34:21,792
this one I thought would be great, yep. Alright, a big if it's like,

6677
06:34:21,793 --> 06:34:26,659
okay, this week, while the package is in my work job and what about

6678
06:34:26,660 --> 06:34:28,680
you work up first in order to press your phone?

6679
06:34:28,681 --> 06:34:36,258
. . Umm,

6680
06:34:36,458 --> 06:34:38,915
Medi X. Yeah, we're looking back,

6681
06:34:38,916 --> 06:34:40,972
you know, it's a dope, it's a to me,

6682
06:34:40,974 --> 06:34:43,074
birds and what? I'm allergic, yeah.

6683
06:34:43,075 --> 06:34:45,936
It's, it's, yeah, it's, it's, it looks like. I saw a project only in

6684
06:34:45,937 --> 06:34:49,146
some way that could explode better because it's freaking out like,

6685
06:34:49,715 --> 06:34:51,753
you know, like, you know, well,

6686
06:34:51,754 --> 06:34:55,255
hit it. Yeah. you automatically come when you have it in your fascia.

6687
06:34:55,256 --> 06:34:57,872
Yeah. Yeah. Or, so what,

6688
06:34:57,948 --> 06:35:00,352
what, yeah, it is. So, when you get it,

6689
06:35:00,353 --> 06:35:04,028
that's the- and you get the job. One of the things you get to

6690
06:35:04,029 --> 06:35:06,640
cross out of the line, one of the mistakes is transfer.

6691
06:35:07,233 --> 06:35:09,361
Wouldn't you get a job, so you got a much better job. Thank you

6692
06:35:09,362 --> 06:35:14,097
very much. Thank you very

6693
06:35:21,233 --> 06:35:25,972
much. much for

6694
06:35:25,973 --> 06:35:30,952
watching. the person

6695
06:35:30,953 --> 06:35:35,654
on It's tough to have people who are an estate engineer with the

6696
06:35:35,655 --> 06:35:38,224
9 hours from overall opportunities in person.

6697
06:35:38,565 --> 06:35:40,751
I think it was big on that.

6698
06:35:40,752 --> 06:35:42,767
So, if people get their job,

6699
06:35:42,768 --> 06:35:45,119
they've got things in the system,

6700
06:35:45,120 --> 06:35:48,731
but there's no step. See ya.

6701
06:35:52,301 --> 06:35:53,588
So, then, you just go into that problem, so you can't get anything from

6702
06:35:53,589 --> 06:35:55,886
any sort of up on this. Carehouse. Get us in the hospital.

6703
06:35:55,887 --> 06:36:03,014
I need to take a look at Umm,

6704
06:36:03,015 --> 06:36:05,805
yeah. You gotta put in,

6705
06:36:05,806 --> 06:36:08,187
like, stickers that kill students who are having.

6706
06:36:08,188 --> 06:36:10,349
So, they don't want you to do that. They don't want you We'll find

6707
06:36:10,350 --> 06:36:12,432
out if you're sitting in the box and you will need, uh,

6708
06:36:12,443 --> 06:36:16,527
lost. Oh You'll be familiar with all of our screen visits and we actually

6709
06:36:16,528 --> 06:36:19,150
have audio in there which is here, uhh,

6710
06:36:19,161 --> 06:36:28,720
well, and our screen sequence. . . . .

6711
06:36:28,740 --> 06:36:36,796
. .

6712
06:36:36,797 --> 06:36:39,294
for the police. Yeah. hmm.

6713
06:36:39,305 --> 06:36:41,380
That's a sudden leadership. Mm hmm. Yeah. That's true. We're just having to say,

6714
06:36:41,385 --> 06:36:46,186
to say. Mm hmm. S. All this in one giant seat.

6715
06:36:46,456 --> 06:36:49,041
It's been good in your class, if you're not still.

6716
06:36:49,311 --> 06:36:52,282
I've been sitting here on this and I don't think I'm going to say

6717
06:36:52,283 --> 06:36:55,923
this. Hey. Ah, I thought I was going to stop this work,

6718
06:36:55,924 --> 06:36:58,914
man. Yeah, I think it's a little bit easier when I was born in

6719
06:36:58,915 --> 06:37:01,504
the south. Listen, it's- It is,

6720
06:37:01,505 --> 06:37:06,038
uhh, it is a Microsoft project that should be greater

6721
06:37:06,039 --> 06:37:09,469
than a lot of people are born. Besides- Well I don't know if she

6722
06:37:09,470 --> 06:37:11,703
got it or she had it, but I don't know what it Yeah,

6723
06:37:11,704 --> 06:37:13,990
cuz this is what C1 takes in three seconds. So I've got to cover

6724
06:37:13,991 --> 06:37:16,485
these boxes up here, here and here.

6725
06:37:16,486 --> 06:37:19,469
Okay, bye. I don't know how to use it,

6726
06:37:19,470 --> 06:37:22,745
but I'll say it's been more than a dollar just for a minute.

6727
06:37:22,746 --> 06:37:25,278
So it's been easy to use this spreadsheet. You But,

6728
06:37:25,507 --> 06:37:28,403
this one kind of does it automatically, it's more over there and then it

6729
06:37:28,404 --> 06:37:30,902
sits down directly. It's already there.

6730
06:37:30,903 --> 06:37:35,447
Yeah. That's So hopefully it really does

6731
06:37:35,448 --> 06:37:39,986
appear to me on your golf or stadium.

6732
06:37:40,153 --> 06:37:43,188
Yeah. Yeah. Depends on my views.

6733
06:37:43,189 --> 06:37:46,554
Uh, we used to look and see what's happening this week and do my

6734
06:37:46,555 --> 06:37:49,751
packages and write them and figure it out. What I mean.

6735
06:37:49,752 --> 06:37:52,036
. This week and that week.

6736
06:37:52,420 --> 06:37:54,897
Yeah, I'm the flatter as a tool for that.

6737
06:37:54,898 --> 06:37:57,566
This is the, I'm staying around.

6738
06:37:57,567 --> 06:38:00,102
You I'm thinking about a part of thousands of people, even though I'm saying

6739
06:38:00,115 --> 06:38:03,568
that. Ten thousand people would be happy to Yeah,

6740
06:38:04,924 --> 06:38:06,959
I'd be happy to be here. Yeah. I'm feeling this guy. guys, pretty small

6741
06:38:06,960 --> 06:38:10,739
amounts of work can do it in their head. But I'm gonna get sick.

6742
06:38:10,786 --> 06:38:13,442
Yeah. If you've got a bunch of 2009 jobs,

6743
06:38:13,443 --> 06:38:17,237
you could. . . and the, uh, sound like,

6744
06:38:17,355 --> 06:38:19,797
I've had an arsenal in a couple weeks,

6745
06:38:19,798 --> 06:38:22,751
very nice. Probably crazy. It's amazing.

6746
06:38:22,752 --> 06:38:24,764
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually,

6747
06:38:24,765 --> 06:38:28,088
I'm gonna write this up a little bit again. I'm gonna find more work

6748
06:38:28,089 --> 06:38:30,731
in between here and there. Bye bye.

6749
06:38:30,732 --> 06:38:34,366
So, yeah, I've got a second of a matching position for this work,

6750
06:38:34,677 --> 06:38:37,006
you know, all the better, the better, the the better,

6751
06:38:37,007 --> 06:38:39,900
the better, the better flow. Yeah, really. You I'm here getting something coming to

6752
06:38:39,901 --> 06:38:42,591
you all the time. That's good.

6753
06:38:43,473 --> 06:38:46,031
Yeah, me and my friends are far out of luck. I mean,

6754
06:38:46,032 --> 06:38:48,036
they're far out of luck. 2 6 All the fabricators in that, I don't

6755
06:38:48,037 --> 06:38:50,137
get to buy it, maybe that should be done anymore,

6756
06:38:50,146 --> 06:38:52,643
but we should have a room big deluxe. And that all,

6757
06:38:52,663 --> 06:38:54,695
all that work if you're getting shipped to be done.

6758
06:38:54,696 --> 06:38:58,557
You Paint to Me. Y'all will sign the work for another guy who's getting

6759
06:38:58,558 --> 06:39:02,062
his face. That will keep my head above water,

6760
06:39:02,063 --> 06:39:04,106
but I will- I think it's a little bit harder,

6761
06:39:04,408 --> 06:39:08,300
yeah. I don't think that I'm going to get a sales fee or a

6762
06:39:08,301 --> 06:39:10,404
charge for it. I think it's exactly- All I love you.

6763
06:39:10,405 --> 06:39:14,136
I love it. What I was saying is the P,

6764
06:39:14,137 --> 06:39:16,526
you know, cost engineers and that.

6765
06:39:16,971 --> 06:39:19,595
Yeah, that's what it sounded like. Thank you. You know,

6766
06:39:19,596 --> 06:39:22,413
pretty much an opportunity falls in my lap,

6767
06:39:22,414 --> 06:39:24,474
hard in my life. You're thinking about communicate, you know, basically,

6768
06:39:25,072 --> 06:39:26,931
I ain't gonna be on the shoot. You you you . . . How

6769
06:39:27,292 --> 06:39:31,996
come tomorrow we're getting, are they mostly getting work for the company that stayed

6770
06:39:31,997 --> 06:39:35,514
down because I'm getting much better over here? Thank Umm,

6771
06:39:35,524 --> 06:39:38,731
I don't know, maybe it's not getting much work out. Very false is energy,

6772
06:39:38,732 --> 06:39:42,791
but nothing very false. I don't think your caster doesn't,

6773
06:39:42,792 --> 06:39:47,558
No, you can't say that much. I think the yesterday's facilities are severely

6774
06:39:47,559 --> 06:39:49,988
underutilized, and they would like to change that.

6775
06:39:49,989 --> 06:39:54,128
we'll more time. Okay. And then,

6776
06:39:54,142 --> 06:39:57,814
in Mexico, they can't keep employees,

6777
06:39:57,815 --> 06:40:00,996
but go. Good. Two to four guys later.

6778
06:40:01,431 --> 06:40:04,937
I think I'm silly. See, there's a bunch of hesitators that need to figure

6779
06:40:04,938 --> 06:40:08,054
out how to build and work. Perfect. That's the money so we can get

6780
06:40:08,055 --> 06:40:10,752
you more jobs and be more competitive. Yeah,

6781
06:40:10,753 --> 06:40:13,459
that's right. Okay. That's the money.

6782
06:40:13,473 --> 06:40:16,047
But, uh, perfect. Yeah, so lovely,

6783
06:40:16,629 --> 06:40:18,656
and that's a good thing man, just like,

6784
06:40:18,657 --> 06:40:21,566
we were so busy all the time and we don't know what changed.

6785
06:40:21,567 --> 06:40:23,634
and we'll see the next one. Well,

6786
06:40:23,639 --> 06:40:27,552
we all certainly haven't started thinking about the stability that you could be listening

6787
06:40:27,553 --> 06:40:29,624
to. How much work have you done,

6788
06:40:29,625 --> 06:40:36,959
sir? Yeah, I mean- I guess

6789
06:40:36,960 --> 06:40:39,625
I don't know how to break it, but I can see. And I think

6790
06:40:39,626 --> 06:40:44,390
that makes me

6791
06:40:44,391 --> 06:40:47,711
proud of you.

6792
06:40:52,962 --> 06:40:55,052
It's very, very somewhat percent proud of margin. It's how I mean.

6793
06:40:55,053 --> 06:40:57,477
You be involved with call frames,

6794
06:40:57,478 --> 06:41:00,785
uh, not somewhere around the world.

6795
06:41:00,786 --> 06:41:03,731
I mean, just one year. Just one year. one year.

6796
06:41:03,732 --> 06:41:06,055
. And that's, well then you can also, you know,

6797
06:41:06,056 --> 06:41:08,060
probably gettin' around the ground.

6798
06:41:08,742 --> 06:41:11,771
Alright, well then we're gonna have it founded by just kind of the necessary-

6799
06:41:11,772 --> 06:41:15,424
Any question? Huh. Will you like it about the same questions?

6800
06:41:15,539 --> 06:41:20,879
Heh, heh. But

6801
06:41:21,215 --> 06:41:24,257
as far as tech was concerned, the thing would be just show us it.

6802
06:41:24,285 --> 06:41:28,729
It would be very helpful if it had long. So no The last one

6803
06:41:28,969 --> 06:41:31,697
should be you want to hear. This is Kingdom 1,

6804
06:41:31,698 --> 06:41:35,412
2025, 224,000 come and ship to job sites.

6805
06:41:35,413 --> 06:41:40,070
and I'll see the next one. I didn't think about Q1 in 2023.

6806
06:41:40,056 --> 06:41:44,934
Three. I've

6807
06:41:44,935 --> 06:41:49,695
been 68,000 months. Should we know how much I don't know if we're done,

6808
06:41:49,696 --> 06:41:52,031
we're done, we're still 4,000. Go ahead, coach.

6809
06:41:52,032 --> 06:41:54,335
Q1.4, Compass,

6810
06:41:54,354 --> 06:41:55,860
and

6811
06:42:00,076 --> 06:42:02,156
Well, this is a horrible one.

6812
06:42:03,754 --> 06:42:06,410
So, Q4, 20, 24.

6813
06:42:06,411 --> 06:42:08,873
Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm gonna see,

6814
06:42:08,874 --> 06:42:11,086
500 and 86.

6815
06:42:11,087 --> 06:42:13,821
And where are we at now? 25.

6816
06:42:13,822 --> 06:42:16,156
And, uh, Q4 goes in the data. It's better.

6817
06:42:16,157 --> 06:42:19,056
7-1, Q3,

6818
06:42:19,057 --> 06:42:21,695

You know, it's, I mean,

6825
06:42:43,696 --> 06:42:46,964
I don't know if there's a truth. I'm sure there's an average that I'm

06:46:19,079 --> 06:46:21,904
for earth. And I'll see And,

6868
06:46:21,905 --> 06:46:24,065
uh, for a president, there's a matrix right in there,

6869
06:46:24,083 --> 06:46:27,875
you can follow up if you want to be here. Could you count that

6870
06:46:27,876 --> 06:46:32,562
both? Yeah, but commercial. I don't see dollars

6871
06:46:32,563 --> 06:46:37,456
anywhere else, I see.

6872
06:46:37,457 --> 06:46:39,498
In half of us, we're done. Alright.

6873
06:46:43,572 --> 06:46:45,491
Then we'll watch. Here, Umm, I'm just gonna film the-

6874
06:46:49,793 --> 06:46:52,907
You can see the, uhm, this showed you a different essence.

6875
06:46:52,908 --> 06:46:55,877
So. I'm like, you can see the essence of it and we need to

6876
06:46:55,878 --> 06:46:57,684
know that. I want that out of it. it.

6877
06:47:09,611 --> 06:47:13,423
Just on the side.

6878
06:47:13,424 --> 06:47:18,812
Mm-hmm. It's

6879
06:47:18,813 --> 06:47:21,160
interesting on side overtators to know.

6880
06:47:21,865 --> 06:47:25,816
Alright, Willem. Okay.

6881
06:47:27,739 --> 06:47:29,782
For me, dollars profound. For, uh, uh, 36, 85,

6882
06:47:29,783 --> 06:47:32,209
16, 70, Grillemore, 36, 70.

6883
06:47:32,210 --> 06:47:36,369
I all know, I'm not sure. I'm saying you. . Get it.

6884
06:47:39,485 --> 06:47:41,574
Ready to pull out a tank of what a put is,

6885
06:47:41,575 --> 06:47:46,184
you're right here, screw it up. Alright,-bye. I'm going to give it a rest

6886
06:47:46,185 --> 06:47:49,391
of the server, but when you do this to somebody,

6887
06:47:49,392 --> 06:47:51,911
I don't know. I- Bye.

6888
06:47:51,912 --> 06:47:52,375
Yes.

6889
06:47:56,607 --> 06:47:59,530
We have done it. It has been a summering work,

6890
06:47:59,583 --> 06:48:02,599
so maybe another reason we'll give it a rest of the park. We haven't

6891
06:48:02,602 --> 06:48:05,075
done it yet, so we'll be seeing this with some reason,

6892
06:48:05,076 --> 06:48:08,613
so we haven't updated any of our dependable reports.

6893
06:48:08,787 --> 06:48:11,220
you do that on the whole room, uhm,

6894
06:48:11,231 --> 06:48:15,796
and also, I have the ability to

6895
06:48:15,797 --> 06:48:17,853
replay the- the margins,

6896
06:48:18,279 --> 06:48:20,529
and I need super-subbing it a little bit easier in this.

6897
06:48:20,530 --> 06:48:24,740
I don't just take a lot of it as long as- And one.

6898
06:48:24,475 --> 06:48:26,646
Bye. Super simple. Hey,

6899
06:48:27,003 --> 06:48:31,693
what up? What I'm just each seeing is that there are 18 programs that

6900
06:48:31,694 --> 06:48:34,639
we gotta go into. Thank you. It's the same thing that we can do

6901
06:48:34,672 --> 06:48:35,667
in a month or a day like that. And I just need you to

6902
06:48:35,668 --> 06:48:39,600
welcome to figure out what one that is. Good afternoon.

6903
06:48:39,601 --> 06:48:42,765
We'll minute. us. All continues. Be on the next the phone. Uh,

6904
06:48:42,775 --> 06:48:45,846
see about something that makes the difference. Yeah,

6905
06:48:45,847 --> 06:48:48,976
nah, that's not going to, I'll always be able to get Thank so much.

6906
06:48:48,977 --> 06:48:51,260
I have some more issues in my core too, love.

6907
06:48:52,445 --> 06:48:55,245
I think there's legacy, and I think there's a lot more.

6908
06:48:55,726 --> 06:48:58,550
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

6909
06:49:04,991 --> 06:49:08,166
Thank you very much. I'll be with you this part of this,

6910
06:49:08,167 --> 06:49:10,424
and then I'll be with you again now.

6911
06:49:10,425 --> 06:49:12,971
I'll be with you this part of this part, and see you next time.

6912
06:49:12,972 --> 06:49:15,594
Because I'm not listening to one place in the moment.

6913
06:49:15,946 --> 06:49:18,606
So I'm really fine listening about this part.

6914
06:49:18,607 --> 06:49:21,011
Yeah. Later.

6915
06:49:21,012 --> 06:49:23,532
Okay. Everything has to go to this stuff.

6916
06:49:23,614 --> 06:49:27,154
I don't know what this is.

6917
06:49:28,991 --> 06:49:31,771
Okay, so hundreds of closers going down. Uh,

6918
06:49:31,782 --> 06:49:34,375
ah, ah, ah, look, I read back to the closers.

6919
06:49:34,655 --> 06:49:36,900
Yeah. And I could decide what to .

6920
06:49:36,901 --> 06:49:42,206
. I think, I

6921
06:49:42,207 --> 06:49:42,841
think I'm going to generate that. That's what I think about. I think you're

6922
06:49:42,842 --> 06:49:45,288
going to stop not having it. Uh,

6923
06:49:45,299 --> 06:49:48,485
ah, uh, see you. Yeah. I think they're putting,

6924
06:49:48,486 --> 06:49:50,685
right there, everything, all the dollars that I'm eating.

6925
06:49:50,686 --> 06:49:54,356
Don't be the heavy bits that I'm eating. Yeah. Cause there's a- There's a

6926
06:49:54,357 --> 06:49:56,654
67 page that comes back.

6927
06:49:56,655 --> 06:50:00,875
Yeah, that's the gap. Copy. Yeah. What the TSM is on.

6928
06:50:00,974 --> 06:50:03,573
I've got another price in there. Just something I didn't price.

6929
06:50:03,574 --> 06:50:06,471
Like, I didn't know if everybody would post,

6930
06:50:06,472 --> 06:50:08,974
calculate everything out. That one would be smooth on time.

6931
06:50:08,975 --> 06:50:13,887
I'll next time. And then we end up drastically reducing our labor rates.

6932
06:50:14,201 --> 06:50:17,640
Our labor rate is more or less than that. With more government than 7.

6933
06:50:17,641 --> 06:50:20,167
Good. Good. A certain dollar rate to limit,

6934
06:50:20,436 --> 06:50:23,322
but we need to work. So, I mean,

6935
06:50:23,323 --> 06:50:25,916
you can do all that already. So, um.

6936
06:50:25,927 --> 06:50:30,796
you like to get it.

6937
06:50:32,829 --> 06:50:36,129
So, they do it by the way, so. I'm not changing the unit cost

6938
06:50:36,130 --> 06:50:40,091
up there because you got to your weight and your,

6939
06:50:40,441 --> 06:50:42,671
I change the unit cost and I go down the lane.

6940
06:50:42,672 --> 06:50:45,503
We're not zero to that. Okay.

6941
06:50:45,511 --> 06:50:48,231
We're going to do that.

6942
06:50:48,232 --> 06:50:55,685
Thank Lucas.

6943
06:50:55,686 --> 06:51:03,725
Thanks. Now

6944
06:51:03,726 --> 06:51:06,791
I'm going to take at our words.

6945
06:51:06,792 --> 06:51:10,831
I can't,

6946
06:51:10,832 --> 06:51:13,501
I'm just kidding. So the quarking is in balance.

6947
06:51:13,503 --> 06:51:15,875
What do we try to do? So,

6948
06:51:16,160 --> 06:51:20,689
if we were trying to switch this to a price per pound.

6949
06:51:20,690 --> 06:51:22,815
Yes, just a unit call.

6950
06:51:22,816 --> 06:51:25,761
I love you. 12.6 for, just get part of the world,

6951
06:51:25,958 --> 06:51:28,125
like, in King County, 50 cents, you know, 30 cents,

6952
06:51:28,126 --> 06:51:30,183
I'm okay. Who is that guy?

6953
06:51:30,184 --> 06:51:34,733
And then, then, you give us, this is our way up to 50,

6954
06:51:34,734 --> 06:51:39,279
the other circles. Yeah, and we go down to the house. Subs by I'm

6955
06:51:39,280 --> 06:51:42,092
here the near, where is your self price?

6956
06:51:42,096 --> 06:51:44,864
Where's your self price? I'm here all the way above.

6957
06:51:46,766 --> 06:51:49,073
Is that- Is a real self price? No,

6958
06:51:49,074 --> 06:51:53,110
to the value. Very good self price.

6959
06:51:53,111 --> 06:51:57,894
you There's your self price for how many times?

6960
06:51:59,402 --> 06:52:01,777
Well, let's visit. This isn't right.

6961
06:52:01,778 --> 06:52:04,031
We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, Okay.

6962
06:52:04,032 --> 06:52:08,852
Right. Okay. I'm with you, because when you collect the

6963
06:52:08,853 --> 06:52:10,908
250, you change everything.

6964
06:52:10,909 --> 06:52:14,567
Yep. You That 250 is probably the patent.

6965
06:52:15,234 --> 06:52:18,992
Yep. Okay. We want to know what we want the program to calculate the

6966
06:52:19,062 --> 06:52:22,709
patent based on the sell- No, no, that's gonna be right there.

6967
06:52:22,710 --> 06:52:25,612
It shouldn't be the price of our material, just the material line.

6968
06:52:25,613 --> 06:52:28,372
It should have made the value on purchase orders. We're ready. We're all probably,

6969
06:52:28,373 --> 06:52:30,478
that's, that's what had more of a use,

6970
06:52:30,479 --> 06:52:34,370
like in this area. We didn't say it. We didn't do the labor.

6971
06:52:34,371 --> 06:52:37,967
We just sold that at price per pay. You sold it.

6972
06:52:37,968 --> 06:52:40,429
Umm, I don't know if I can write this right. Also in the price,

6973
06:52:40,438 --> 06:52:42,943
I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't, they never read it.

6974
06:52:42,944 --> 06:52:46,693
It's in the bank. Yeah. you Yeah. So do you have any idea what

6975
06:52:46,694 --> 06:52:49,143
the strengths are all for? Umm,

6976
06:52:49,154 --> 06:52:52,031
okay. So. Thank you.

6977
06:52:52,032 --> 06:52:57,005
What

6978
06:52:57,006 --> 06:53:01,031
does that mean? Okay.

6979
06:53:01,894 --> 06:53:04,378
Here we are, point to me, this is private school. There you be.

6980
06:53:05,329 --> 06:53:08,532
It's two thousand of you who have a significant lead to what I think.

6981
06:53:08,533 --> 06:53:15,209
Thank you. So

6982
06:53:15,210 --> 06:53:17,702
you have to go to the folder to- and look at it.

6983
06:53:17,703 --> 06:53:20,040
She wouldn't just hop into this level, look at it.

6984
06:53:20,371 --> 06:53:25,091
I think there's some of that in some people who don't know about it.

6985
06:53:25,092 --> 06:53:27,374
. . But you want the job, right?

6986
06:53:27,510 --> 06:53:30,353
But because you submitted that,

6987
06:53:30,354 --> 06:53:33,131
you entered it just as a contract. I'm sorry.

6988
06:53:33,132 --> 06:53:35,686
I'm sorry. I'm just worried real about this.

6989
06:53:36,233 --> 06:53:40,775
Same. Most proposals just need the promise we don't

6990
06:53:40,776 --> 06:53:43,679
do it now. Uhh, uhh,

6991
06:53:43,700 --> 06:53:48,985
ehm, ehm, ehm, Yeah,

6992
06:53:48,986 --> 06:53:51,094
two thousand and, Filling one hours,

6993
06:53:51,769 --> 06:53:54,449
maybe twenty-seven thousand dollars, fifteen thousand profit,

6994
06:53:54,450 --> 06:53:56,628
and then a twelve percent They're a thousanders.

6995
06:53:57,527 --> 06:54:00,355
All right. Universal was at three hundred and thirty thousand pounds.

6996
06:54:02,325 --> 06:54:06,071
That is not right. Okay. This.

6997
06:54:06,072 --> 06:54:10,715
That'd be a hundred

6998
06:54:10,716 --> 06:54:17,032
and fifty nine pounds a No. Let's

6999
06:54:18,291 --> 06:54:19,836
see. It's floating

7000
06:54:31,811 --> 06:54:36,742
First in it, 3,6,000

7001
06:54:36,743 --> 06:54:38,790
pounds, let's see what makes it smoke.

7002
06:54:38,791 --> 06:54:43,007
Oh. Have a way to try to get 6,000 pounds,

7003
06:54:43,008 --> 06:54:45,326
we're going to send it out with us, and we should send it out.

7004
06:54:45,327 --> 06:54:48,083
Can you do that? Yeah,

7005
06:54:48,084 --> 06:54:51,685
there's in there. If you're going to do it at a level,

7006
06:54:52,893 --> 06:54:56,788
it's like, oh. Yeah, there's no material in there. Oh! Come on. Yeah.

7007
06:54:57,004 --> 06:54:59,407
Okay. Yeah, it's later on.

7008
06:54:59,408 --> 06:55:01,746
Spellpass, ridiculous glass connector,

7009
06:55:02,420 --> 06:55:07,111
and chef's seal. Oh. $127,000 for

7010
06:55:07,112 --> 06:55:09,262
256,000 pounds.

7011
06:55:09,822 --> 06:55:12,011
You're doing the labor at 50 cents a pound.

7012
06:55:12,012 --> 06:55:14,790
You're doing the labor at 2 dollars a pound.

7013
06:55:14,791 --> 06:55:19,299
128 cents.

7014
06:55:19,300 --> 06:55:21,757
you guys. And we make money.

7015
06:55:21,758 --> 06:55:25,641
And I just said yes. We make some,

7016
06:55:26,179 --> 06:55:33,402
up to T-Ray, comms. So you were getting paid $60,000,

7017
06:55:33,403 --> 06:55:35,820
if you did the job really in charge of $100,000.

7018
06:55:36,191 --> 06:55:39,014
You know, especially with Compass,

7019
06:55:40,420 --> 06:55:42,870
they're $15,000.

7020
06:55:42,871 --> 06:55:46,838
What is that? Okay. Yeah,

7021
06:55:46,839 --> 06:55:49,593
it's not very much. Well,

7022
06:55:49,594 --> 06:55:52,381
I'm used to it. I mean, what's the shop right here? Thanks for the

7023
06:55:52,605 --> 06:55:55,260
cost. Please be quiet. I'm to fix this. Uh,

7024
06:55:55,271 --> 06:55:57,974
Ops, it's hard because they keep,

7025
06:55:57,975 --> 06:55:59,950
they keep splitting up. We're of whole the road. I of these There's blocking,

7026
06:55:59,951 --> 06:56:01,985
but help? We'll have the You are trying to split overhead out of it.

7027
06:56:02,377 --> 06:56:07,699
So, uhm, I think our action will sell with the 48

7028
06:56:07,700 --> 06:56:09,951
or 49. Yeah. And, you know, I wish you something like that.

7029
06:56:10,533 --> 06:56:12,691
Put that out of it, put that out right ahead.

06:56:38,394 --> 06:56:40,451
there's okay, he's gonna be.

7038

It's free. Yeah,

7045

it's not. Boom.

7062
06:58:02,402 --> 06:58:05,142
Boom. That's what we were doing well,

7063
06:58:06,880 --> 06:58:11,817
I think. That's the thing. About when we I'm not We were probably

7064
06:58:11,818 --> 06:58:17,541
going to finish at 47%.

7065
06:58:17,542 --> 06:58:20,263
So, so we aren't cheap. . .

7066
06:58:20,264 --> 06:58:22,429
. .

7067
06:58:22,430 --> 06:58:24,595
. .

7068
06:58:24,596 --> 06:58:26,760
. .

7069
06:58:27,191 --> 06:58:30,981
We're talking about syrup. Let's see what that is.

7070
06:58:30,982 --> 06:58:33,151
Yeah, that's good. Slow.

7071
06:58:33,152 --> 06:58:35,231
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

7072
06:58:35,232 --> 06:58:40,211
Thank you. We had, uhm, a pretty much run through everything we did on

7073
06:58:40,212 --> 06:58:43,211
the videos. I'll tell you what I don't like. Thanks for your time.

7074
06:58:45,823 --> 06:58:48,227
Yeah, what's that? Oh, yeah. Okay, so I'm, I'm pretty much a brat here,

7075
06:58:48,271 --> 06:58:50,952
so whatever you want in table, I don't know. That was some insight.

7076
06:58:50,953 --> 06:58:53,179
side. I would,

7077
06:58:53,180 --> 06:58:57,400
I would like to absolutely run through the entire work line.

7078
06:58:57,950 --> 06:59:00,974
And so it was okay. Good. Uh, hey, I'm not talking,

7079
06:59:00,975 --> 06:59:03,304
S.M.A.

7080
06:59:03,305 --> 06:59:05,657
entrepreneurship.

7081
06:59:05,920 --> 06:59:09,584
ship them. I have a house to be in the emergency,

7082
06:59:09,763 --> 06:59:14,511
to make sure everything is in the machine.

7083
06:59:14,512 --> 06:59:17,306
Alright, sounds great. Kinda like with,

7084
06:59:17,736 --> 06:59:20,449
with estimating, uh, I'm, I'm not.

7085
06:59:21,710 --> 06:59:24,196
Yeah, if a goal is,

7086
06:59:24,197 --> 06:59:26,330
Well, yeah,

7087
06:59:26,391 --> 06:59:30,711
when I'm leaving here to ride on the court, I'll get my team to

7088
06:59:30,712 --> 06:59:35,362
hear us out. You I mean, obviously part of what I'll say

7089
06:59:35,535 --> 06:59:38,921
is, I think there should be way too many programs that are being used

7090
06:59:38,922 --> 06:59:41,288
for the same day as, Oh, yeah. Yeah,

7091
06:59:42,034 --> 06:59:45,895
to me estimating is better for my business.

7092
06:59:46,693 --> 06:59:50,035
That's my pleasure. So he made it.

7093
06:59:51,250 --> 06:59:53,343
Yeah. But like, I'm happy with this. It's, uh,

7094
06:59:53,354 --> 06:59:56,236
it's a chemical fly with all of us.

7095
06:59:56,237 --> 06:59:58,803
And a, uh, instruction valve.

7096
06:59:59,203 --> 07:00:02,879
And so, uh, it, it, and what part of the system here can be

7097
07:00:02,880 --> 07:00:05,118
used. and I'm glad we're here to bring some . . And then it

7098
07:00:05,119 --> 07:00:07,813
can be modified for your own purposes.

7099
07:00:07,814 --> 07:00:10,552
So what you're saying, if you'd like to say, this is .

7100
07:00:10,553 --> 07:00:14,069
. what you think it could be If you'd like to know what is

7101
07:00:14,070 --> 07:00:16,100
. . that's kind of the . .

7102
07:00:16,101 --> 07:00:18,347
the word. Yeah, and what's .

7103
07:00:18,348 --> 07:00:22,333
. . what the ice because I wanted to know about myself.

7104
07:00:22,767 --> 07:00:26,021
Yeah. I'd like to kind of just start walking through .

7105
07:00:26,022 --> 07:00:28,516
. . really walking through this . . then like,

7106
07:00:28,517 --> 07:00:32,420
you know, what form of essence being done in here or how many materials

7107
07:00:32,421 --> 07:00:34,573
sitting there . . . going . . . Yeah,

7108
07:00:34,574 --> 07:00:37,002
I got, I got, I got, you know this stuff,

7109
07:00:37,003 --> 07:00:39,355
but I think it'd be great that I had to find a few .

7110
07:00:39,356 --> 07:00:41,702
. . so I'm pretty 100% of that .

7111
07:00:41,703 --> 07:00:44,747
. . Yeah, that's our first 9 minutes Yeah,

7112
07:00:44,748 --> 07:00:46,822
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So .

7113
07:00:46,823 --> 07:00:51,381
. is everything that I do when I

7114
07:00:51,382 --> 07:00:55,524
run That's how I managed to live so that .

7115
07:00:55,525 --> 07:00:58,535
. . So . . . I do all say all to me that

7116
07:00:58,536 --> 07:01:02,012
this is about my own I think that's very easy to do.

7117
07:01:02,211 --> 07:01:06,558
But even when you're wrapping it up and you're going over in the program

7118
07:01:06,559 --> 07:01:11,082
or so . . is that a company reason for that

7119
07:01:11,083 --> 07:01:14,507
or is that a . . . that's just what we did with anything

7120
07:01:14,508 --> 07:01:18,499
or is it . . . yeah, just and it may be the best,

7121
07:01:18,500 --> 07:01:21,074
but I don't wanna come . . . I'm just playing a simple and

7122
07:01:21,075 --> 07:01:23,916
extra work with me because I've got to get each other there.

7123
07:01:23,917 --> 07:01:26,527
Uh Pull all this information from,

7124
07:01:26,528 --> 07:01:29,159
technically, take over the video, so it'll be .

7125
07:01:29,160 --> 07:01:32,296
. wearing something . . . doing that much at the time.

7126
07:01:32,297 --> 07:01:34,653
I'm here . . yeah, yeah. If I'm recent,

7127
07:01:34,654 --> 07:01:39,888
it'll . . . yeah. But . . . and for four whenever we

7128
07:01:39,889 --> 07:01:44,033
get uh, we . . . we have an opportunity to give you an

7129
07:01:44,034 --> 07:01:48,055
opportunity to lighten it up to the point of when they create an estimate

7130
07:01:48,056 --> 07:01:50,584
for . . . in the creative job on Pro Lord.

7131
07:01:50,885 --> 07:01:53,333
And then I am assigned to the associated estimator,

7132
07:01:53,495 --> 07:01:56,296
which is until it's, uhm, a tiny sales force.

7133
07:01:56,297 --> 07:01:58,634
Yeah, yeah, which is a sale opportunity.

7134
07:01:58,885 --> 07:02:02,313
And then depending on the status that it's in for a Lord,

7135
07:02:02,467 --> 07:02:06,451
whether it's submitted or awarded. or anything. And you want not based upon the

7136
07:02:06,452 --> 07:02:08,464
Bit or, uh,

7137
07:02:08,475 --> 07:02:11,533
this kind of stuff updates Salesforce.

7138
07:02:11,534 --> 07:02:14,113
Oops. Staw on the self-worth.

7139
07:02:14,411 --> 07:02:16,960
But you want to go through the whole job, start to finish,

7140
07:02:16,961 --> 07:02:19,285
then we're using it with Integrity. That correct?

7141
07:02:19,508 --> 07:02:21,581
Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I'm not a regression.

7142
07:02:21,699 --> 07:02:25,502
Yeah. I just have to make sure here's the steps.

7143
07:02:25,715 --> 07:02:27,984
But you can do that because you like the main document.

7144
07:02:27,985 --> 07:02:30,675
I love you. Yeah. Yeah. So where,

7145
07:02:30,676 --> 07:02:33,615
where do we have to be?

7146
07:02:33,616 --> 07:02:36,311
Uh, we have this to be in technical,

7147
07:02:36,312 --> 07:02:40,186
Uh, every day, and it turns on at the one that I don't know.

7148
07:02:40,187 --> 07:02:40,440
Bye

7149
07:02:45,191 --> 07:02:47,263
All scrums roll is just a minute and a second.

7150
07:02:47,659 --> 07:02:52,188
What, you're saying that he has? I agree with it.

7151
07:02:52,189 --> 07:02:56,837
Now, based on the number, Yeah, in my six days.

7152
07:02:58,257 --> 07:03:02,055
So, And yeah,

7153
07:03:02,107 --> 07:03:04,688
we want to walk through this now. I can start through this now.

7154
07:03:04,689 --> 07:03:06,694
We want to wait a little more. No, no, no, no now.

7155
07:03:06,873 --> 07:03:09,311
Alright, so, Bye.

7156
07:03:09,312 --> 07:03:11,782
Ask me, do you get a job?

7157
07:03:11,783 --> 07:03:13,860
Alright. Umm,

7158
07:03:13,871 --> 07:03:17,019
I can't even answer my technical problem.

7159
07:03:17,020 --> 07:03:19,434
Mm-hmm. So, uh, this will be,

7160
07:03:22,584 --> 07:03:26,278
but man, first I'll settle on this in techno s- Some in heavy,

7161
07:03:26,279 --> 07:03:29,623
heavy, sub or else,

7162
07:03:30,196 --> 07:03:33,311
some kind of additional system that I'm not privy to.

7163
07:03:33,312 --> 07:03:37,967
But for what you do,

7164
07:03:37,968 --> 07:03:40,138
for the structural side, it's here. Here.

7165
07:03:40,139 --> 07:03:42,251
Thank you.

7166
07:03:42,252 --> 07:03:44,677
The market here as well,

7167
07:03:44,678 --> 07:03:47,966
or she does, does the other thing. Umm,

7168
07:03:47,977 --> 07:03:50,179
marks you can do in manual take ups, time.

7169
07:03:50,180 --> 07:03:52,614
On. I'm doing type of take ups, we compare.

7170
07:03:52,618 --> 07:03:54,757
All the same jobs. Yeah, that's it.

7171
07:03:54,900 --> 07:04:04,410
Okay. Okay. Umm,

7172
07:04:04,421 --> 07:04:06,441
I'm gonna go through the steps of the estimate.

7173
07:04:06,442 --> 07:04:10,984
Mhm. Well, I mean, we don't have to do the steps,

7174
07:04:10,985 --> 07:04:15,489
but, um. you Let's play a

7175
07:04:15,490 --> 07:04:18,832
little bit elevated without getting into the details.

7176
07:04:18,833 --> 07:04:22,751
After you get the job, let's do my stuff to you.

7177
07:04:22,752 --> 07:04:25,459
How can you do the project? You rest a bit.

7178
07:04:25,609 --> 07:04:28,104
Or not. Umm,

7179
07:04:28,114 --> 07:04:30,497
no, I'll link it. So you need to go to your homepage.

7180
07:04:30,498 --> 07:04:32,609
Thank you. Like, so like this one,

7181
07:04:32,610 --> 07:04:36,824
MGS, umm. This is my,

7182
07:04:36,945 --> 07:04:40,595
this is my estimate here, so. So, A lot of energy and production can

7183
07:04:40,596 --> 07:04:44,008
be sold, because I prefer entering on with something there.

7184
07:04:44,009 --> 07:04:46,871
A lot of energy, everything in there, when it's for the kids to,

7185
07:04:46,872 --> 07:04:50,944
uh, imported in here, so it has all the information and,

7186
07:04:50,945 --> 07:04:53,682
uh, um, all my breakouts,

7187
07:04:54,018 --> 07:04:56,903
so, and then, Listen, John, I can do God if I can do it.

7188
07:04:57,140 --> 07:05:00,092
You know, it's having a, no-one doing this for a piece this week,

7189
07:05:00,169 --> 07:05:02,951
okay? Um, and so,

7190
07:05:02,952 --> 07:05:06,813
I'll estimate by, by drawing,

7191
07:05:07,203 --> 07:05:09,724
and break all this information down,

7192
07:05:10,071 --> 07:05:12,317
and then, I get my total hours,

7193
07:05:12,735 --> 07:05:17,403
and, and then I end up going into Pro Board,

7194
07:05:17,619 --> 07:05:20,912
and, So you know, most bigs.

7195
07:05:21,713 --> 07:05:23,100
What's that been? .

7196
07:05:27,360 --> 07:05:29,980
. . . . . .

7197
07:05:29,981 --> 07:05:33,020
. .

7198
07:05:33,021 --> 07:05:35,060
. . . .

7199
07:05:35,061 --> 07:05:40,060
.

7200
07:05:43,151 --> 07:05:47,689
It's a sign that

7201
07:05:47,690 --> 07:05:49,990
is estimated so I'll go on an estimating,

7202
07:05:49,991 --> 07:05:53,976
uhh, product. You part of why I think we were also doing it in

7203
07:05:53,977 --> 07:05:57,996
here, is to the feelings, side of the things that are all broken in

7204
07:05:57,997 --> 07:06:00,853
here. Yeah. Yeah. Half, Puddings broke up,

7205
07:06:00,887 --> 07:06:02,896
and Jira not make the exact limit.

7206
07:06:02,897 --> 07:06:06,666
Now I'm just going to add to the 10-12 periods and do all of

7207
07:06:06,667 --> 07:06:08,670
those. Those. Do all those steps in there.

7208
07:06:08,671 --> 07:06:13,266
Um, but I'm going here and I'll hook in my shot hours for

7209
07:06:13,267 --> 07:06:15,431
what was estimated. I'll go in.

7210
07:06:15,432 --> 07:06:18,319
You can take all the quotes that I got from my materials.

7211
07:06:18,615 --> 07:06:20,806
I'll add all my material quotes in here.

7212
07:06:20,807 --> 07:06:23,411
So that's my material real quick. So.

7213
07:06:23,412 --> 07:06:26,500
. The material cost is not intended.

7214
07:06:27,455 --> 07:06:30,381
Okay. If we're not using it.

7215
07:06:30,803 --> 07:06:36,767
Are we- So, uhm, I haven't- I haven't

7216
07:06:36,768 --> 07:06:41,011
messed around. You like any of my thoughts,

7217
07:06:41,113 --> 07:06:44,604
even to tech- I usually just wouldn't be able to find one.

7218
07:06:44,845 --> 07:06:47,440
Yeah, cause- this is essentially where- .

7219
07:06:47,476 --> 07:06:52,851
Where I build my- my proposal for everything now on certifications,

7220
07:06:52,871 --> 07:06:55,127
ponies, information, umm,

7221
07:06:55,137 --> 07:06:57,484
including- exclusions,

7222
07:06:57,485 --> 07:07:00,097
for- for everything.

7223
07:07:00,191 --> 07:07:02,692
And then this is all full. Yeah,

7224
07:07:02,693 --> 07:07:07,219
this is all full. Yeah, so I'll submit everything through

7225
07:07:07,220 --> 07:07:09,868
here. I mean, well, something like that.

7226
07:07:09,879 --> 07:07:12,710
So you do this because you don't have- I have all this set up

7227
07:07:12,711 --> 07:07:15,440
in a low-bro template in Tacklion.

7228
07:07:15,441 --> 07:07:20,356
Yeah. So if you hand this all in Tacklion-

7229
07:07:20,357 --> 07:07:22,837
You wouldn't stop using Pro-Gortlin.

7230
07:07:23,323 --> 07:07:25,887
Yeah, that's a series of IMPs with Pro-Gortlin.

7231
07:07:25,968 --> 07:07:27,980
Yeah, and then let's save a whole lot of transfer.

7232
07:07:27,981 --> 07:07:30,207
Thanks for your attention. I don't know what the is. Okay,

7233
07:07:30,208 --> 07:07:32,738
sir, can you go back for a job and show us where you put

7234
07:07:32,739 --> 07:07:36,328
the material cost and you haven't even broke or entered into technical-

7235
07:07:44,411 --> 07:07:47,866
It is what you want,

7236
07:07:47,867 --> 07:07:51,418
right? Okay. There must be palim using tech already.

7237
07:07:52,300 --> 07:07:55,179
Yeah, well, I'll be- It does sound like eating both of it's,

7238
07:07:55,180 --> 07:07:57,912
uh, already reason in tech,

7239
07:07:57,913 --> 07:08:01,396
right? You know. This is where you wrap this up.

7240
07:08:01,397 --> 07:08:04,120
So,

7241
07:08:04,121 --> 07:08:06,744
yeah, if you're doing weird purchasing from here,

7242
07:08:06,807 --> 07:08:09,287
you're not going to have to be in here somewhere, even buying here all

7243
07:08:09,288 --> 07:08:11,999
four, right? No. No. No,

7244
07:08:12,000 --> 07:08:15,095
it's not all. It was all over. It was that tiny.

7245
07:08:15,264 --> 07:08:18,206
Okay. I mean, you could do this here.

7246
07:08:18,207 --> 07:08:22,720
Thank you. Yes, but that is not where I would normally

7247
07:08:23,287 --> 07:08:26,181
do it. I would be funny.

7248
07:08:26,182 --> 07:08:28,893
You know, I'd ditch, like, if I had,

7249
07:08:28,894 --> 07:08:31,178
uh, eight, nine, a half,

7250
07:08:31,179 --> 07:08:34,204
two, I would put, you know, specific price.

7251
07:08:34,205 --> 07:08:36,506
Nice. I have a spoon of spoon,

7252
07:08:38,092 --> 07:08:40,928
you know, any other size food. So, feel like long ago,

7253
07:08:41,203 --> 07:08:43,999
do you write out your proof? I'm to sort of, you're going to,

7254
07:08:44,207 --> 07:08:47,881
the project maintenance section, right? And you're going to report your first C section.

7255
07:08:48,057 --> 07:08:50,405
I don't have any other motion to control, currently, to control.

7256
07:08:50,406 --> 07:08:53,805
You're not using estimated also, a little bit of production control.

7257
07:08:54,197 --> 07:08:58,300
Let's see what's your work. But that's not what we would do here for

7258
07:08:58,301 --> 07:09:02,028
the s- of the estimate. Co-pose that again.

7259
07:09:04,094 --> 07:09:08,475
So it's not pricing to do anything first. And we'll call the material,

7260
07:09:08,669 --> 07:09:12,087
the material cost can just flow in from the badness if you want to.

7261
07:09:12,110 --> 07:09:14,411
If you maintain the price and maintenance. Thanks for watching.

7262
07:09:14,412 --> 07:09:17,246
Yes, as I am, we're going to hear you're just quality.

7263
07:09:17,451 --> 07:09:21,992
Yeah, umm, so, the second means which is what most

7264
07:09:21,993 --> 07:09:25,938
people do. You got the estimated drop down and you get a job specific

7265
07:09:25,939 --> 07:09:29,979
pricing maintenance. Hey,

7266
07:09:29,980 --> 07:09:33,375
throw up the pricing drop down. That's very tough and to add sums for

7267
07:09:33,376 --> 07:09:35,998
an estimate. Pull everything over.

7268
07:09:37,681 --> 07:09:40,331
Okay, you have a copy of the prices from them down.

7269
07:09:40,332 --> 07:09:42,559
So if it's, if it's a price,

7270
07:09:42,560 --> 07:09:44,900
it's in there, pulls over, like, there's a pop-up road,

7271
07:09:44,901 --> 07:09:47,976
$1.36, $100, right? Um,

7272
07:09:47,987 --> 07:09:50,162
and it's- And I'm adjusting to the area.

7273
07:09:50,163 --> 07:09:52,396
If I want to let a neighborhood change and get, like,

7274
07:09:52,397 --> 07:09:54,465
here's a big change from the wall line.

7275
07:09:54,466 --> 07:10:00,036
Bye-bye. And then that locks

7276
07:10:00,037 --> 07:10:02,738
the pricing in here so it's not going to change.

7277
07:10:03,209 --> 07:10:06,304
And it also, uhh, uhh, it puts a lot of evidence from the software.

7278
07:10:06,724 --> 07:10:11,302
This is being set up to where even users are processing

7279
07:10:11,303 --> 07:10:15,071
the rest of their English. I'm sorry. I've been in reporting compared to,

7280
07:10:15,072 --> 07:10:18,243
uh, what the actions are. And then after this,

7281
07:10:18,244 --> 07:10:21,213
then you go to purchase it. And. We'll see the next and we'll have

7282
07:10:21,214 --> 07:10:25,782
this price compared to, yeah. Can you do all the questions

7283
07:10:25,783 --> 07:10:28,405
in here? Plus I have a pricing name.

7284
07:10:28,406 --> 07:10:32,012
You don't know. He said a lot of times.

7285
07:10:32,199 --> 07:10:34,654
Mm hmm. And once a quarter,

7286
07:10:34,655 --> 07:10:36,905
I send jobs to my vendors and they fill it in. Yeah.

7287
07:10:37,393 --> 07:10:39,869
I can update this and then push it all in.

7288
07:10:40,016 --> 07:10:42,162
Yes. I see. Yeah. More. Yeah.

7289
07:10:42,170 --> 07:10:44,656
Okay. That's my option. with plastic.

7290
07:10:44,657 --> 07:10:48,841
Yeah. So like, do more prices than they do better.

7291
07:10:48,980 --> 07:10:51,534
Thank you, Jira. Thanks. You can pull that in.

7292
07:10:51,535 --> 07:10:56,460
Yeah. Couple of money. So that's the normal

7293
07:10:56,461 --> 07:10:59,051
way of doing the material prices you can get.

7294
07:10:59,052 --> 07:11:02,309
Right? Really easy, right? And then,

7295
07:11:02,500 --> 07:11:07,059
it will also be the remnants of

7296
07:11:07,060 --> 07:11:09,954
your jobs to be that point to you. So you're going to be attracting

7297
07:11:09,955 --> 07:11:12,664
better clothes, uh, different percentage,

7298
07:11:13,067 --> 07:11:15,222
or you can put it in the body and you're going to get more

7299
07:11:15,223 --> 07:11:17,664
exact so that you have a small- Oh the project,

7300
07:11:17,665 --> 07:11:22,574
uh, on my head, oh, you should scrap on the job because it's smaller,

7301
07:11:22,575 --> 07:11:24,579
right? Whereas, while you're a project.

7302
07:11:24,580 --> 07:11:27,868
I it. So,

7303
07:11:27,869 --> 07:11:30,192
you can buy the video you want. So, price, uh, this and all we

7304
07:11:31,686 --> 07:11:36,452
have. So, and then,

7305
07:11:36,453 --> 07:11:39,017
yeah, it's said about quality and comparison.

7306
07:11:39,018 --> 07:11:42,466
So, so. what if you're wrapping it up again?

7307
07:11:42,467 --> 07:11:47,249
Umm, so really, all you're doing this for us to get out is,

7308
07:11:47,250 --> 07:11:49,303
rather than what disappoints you, right? Thank having me. Yeah,

7309
07:11:49,460 --> 07:11:52,491
yeah. Pretty much just try it out.

7310
07:11:52,626 --> 07:11:56,835
So, you know what I'm do now?

7311
07:11:56,836 --> 07:12:02,172
okay I'm here, and then, uhm,

7312
07:12:02,182 --> 07:12:05,051
and everybody else live this thing.

7313
07:12:05,052 --> 07:12:08,330
. . . .and then once,

7314
07:12:09,267 --> 07:12:11,401
once it's done,

7315
07:12:11,402 --> 07:12:16,300
the bottle's sent off Bye. I think there's a where

7316
07:12:16,301 --> 07:12:18,411
it needs to be, uhm, em, that's an ethic of invest, production control,

7317
07:12:18,934 --> 07:12:22,154
and it's, it's a matter of a matter of matter of matter of money.

7318
07:12:22,677 --> 07:12:25,343
So, you think that, erm,

7319
07:12:26,324 --> 07:12:28,168
it's a guys nt about it, and,

7320
07:12:36,288 --> 07:12:36,499
you know, so, you then I mean, like, for material, the cost, and you

7321
07:12:36,500 --> 07:12:40,426
know. Go. No, I love the mind here so that they have new lighting

7322
07:12:40,427 --> 07:12:42,692
movements. You know, they're about to be.

7323
07:12:42,693 --> 07:12:47,651
This one is exactly like keyboard. That's Good. That's

7324
07:12:47,652 --> 07:12:50,218
so surprising to me.

7325
07:12:51,202 --> 07:12:53,296
So, let it in here. Beautiful.

7326
07:12:53,297 --> 07:12:56,330
I have a lot of new brush control over there,

7327
07:12:56,331 --> 07:12:59,443
and I've got a lot of,

7328
07:12:59,444 --> 07:13:01,667
um, everything that I do. Thank you. So,

7329
07:13:01,668 --> 07:13:06,534
let's drop back there, because we can just jump away from

7330
07:13:06,535 --> 07:13:09,067
our heads. So, we got, we did this.

7331
07:13:09,068 --> 07:13:14,025
Yes. Umm, and, so that goes

7332
07:13:14,026 --> 07:13:17,037
over to Pro 4, everything gets submitted there.

7333
07:13:17,038 --> 07:13:19,138
You nothing else comes back in the,

7334
07:13:19,139 --> 07:13:22,380
uh, in the resume. When you win the job.

7335
07:13:22,381 --> 07:13:25,456
Umm, but let's be all,

7336
07:13:25,457 --> 07:13:27,557
You don't really do advance meals,

7337
07:13:27,558 --> 07:13:30,953
right? Alright, umm.

7338
07:13:30,964 --> 07:13:33,411
Sorry, let's not be here anymore.

7339
07:13:33,412 --> 07:13:36,871
more. Let's not really worry about my children in terms of how much children

7340
07:13:37,069 --> 07:13:39,731
there is in your room, like a big patient. Just send it out and

7341
07:13:39,732 --> 07:13:42,225
say, what's the good thing about their meals? Thank you. I'll just bring you

7342
07:13:42,226 --> 07:13:45,712
some new benefits.

7343
07:13:45,713 --> 07:13:48,657
Steve Hurley, look before you actually finish your design.

7344
07:13:48,919 --> 07:13:52,533
Thank you. So, let's get into,

7345
07:13:53,132 --> 07:13:56,571
alright, you win the job, set the job up.

7346
07:13:56,893 --> 07:14:01,796
What in- Thanks for watching. Project management is being utilized as opposed

7347
07:14:01,797 --> 07:14:04,355
to elsewhere. Pretty minimal,

7348
07:14:04,356 --> 07:14:07,773
alright. Bye. I think it is with,

7349
07:14:07,774 --> 07:14:12,559
uhm, usually the VISTA and Pro-Corps,

7350
07:14:12,700 --> 07:14:14,884
a lot of that is, Dundell Square.

7351
07:14:15,600 --> 07:14:18,031
And, I'll say in a lot of cases,

7352
07:14:18,032 --> 07:14:23,048
rightfully so. So, RFOX. We'll see you in a

7353
07:14:23,314 --> 07:14:26,023
Where are our cost? I do all of my own.

7354
07:14:26,024 --> 07:14:29,024
I that's too weird. What about it?

7355
07:14:29,025 --> 07:14:32,144
We've got it. We've got it. What about our names?

7356
07:14:32,761 --> 07:14:35,002
I'm the only one who gives you stuff.

7357
07:14:36,877 --> 07:14:44,726
Good luck. Let's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- I wish

7358
07:14:44,727 --> 07:14:47,845
you More transmittals come in dry,

7359
07:14:47,846 --> 07:14:51,902
warm love and distract all the wet bit before the cut behind here's our

7360
07:14:51,903 --> 07:14:54,449
uncertainty. And the other things? Thanks. No.

7361
07:14:54,942 --> 07:14:57,126
But the other guys don't do it. They're,

7362
07:14:57,181 --> 07:14:59,190
it's estimated in their mouths and looks, uh,

7363
07:14:59,201 --> 07:15:01,781
they're older things to get decimated out and then they never need to.

7364
07:15:01,782 --> 07:15:03,978
You basically, we just program again. That,

7365
07:15:03,979 --> 07:15:07,830
right? It's just, that's made out of it and they're not looking to take

7366
07:15:08,220 --> 07:15:10,355
it. So. So. In,

7367
07:15:10,356 --> 07:15:12,668
in, do you control all of the,

7368
07:15:12,669 --> 07:15:15,088
uhh, you're all in love?

7369
07:15:15,271 --> 07:15:18,524
I feel like I'm really mean. I'm sorry. for it. Did,

7370
07:15:18,670 --> 07:15:22,079
did you control all of the drawing long and transmittals for everything you want

7371
07:15:22,080 --> 07:15:26,189
us to review? Okay, so all, all the app for approval and- I was

7372
07:15:26,190 --> 07:15:29,200
thinking of you and you can see what girls are all engines.

7373
07:15:29,459 --> 07:15:34,091
Okay. Um, for anything that- and I-

7374
07:15:34,092 --> 07:15:36,329
But some of the only one? Yeah.

7375
07:15:36,427 --> 07:15:39,604
None of the other project engineers set in their face with the new their

7376
07:15:39,605 --> 07:15:41,830
customers are using this format. Now we can one. Yeah.

7377
07:15:41,831 --> 07:15:46,794
Is that work that goes through this facility?

7378
07:15:46,819 --> 07:15:50,171
Or, uh, sometimes,

7379
07:15:50,172 --> 07:15:52,197
And it's the work that everyone's doing this facility.

7380
07:15:52,198 --> 07:15:54,612
Uh, it'll be most of the time,

7381
07:15:54,613 --> 07:15:56,643
and I see it. It's, it's, uh,

7382
07:15:56,654 --> 07:16:00,669
the project according to the question. One for this is the work that you

7383
07:16:00,670 --> 07:16:05,033
push through. They already work through all that outcomes several times in these.

7384
07:16:05,560 --> 07:16:10,420
So let us- the work that you guys do that somebody

7385
07:16:10,421 --> 07:16:13,582
else is controlling and they handle all that out for approval.

7386
07:16:13,583 --> 07:16:16,343
We'll try this now. We'll draw along all that somewhere else.

7387
07:16:17,090 --> 07:16:19,446
Okay. Even though it's the same company.

7388
07:16:19,969 --> 07:16:22,336
The uhh. Bye-bye.

7389
07:16:22,337 --> 07:16:27,705
The only stuff that's trapped in Tekla for transmittals,

7390
07:16:27,706 --> 07:16:30,125
RFIs, strong law,

7391
07:16:30,126 --> 07:16:35,212
back. Backing forth between detailers and approval stages is my

7392
07:16:35,213 --> 07:16:38,096
project and things that I did. So the other guy can help you use

7393
07:16:38,097 --> 07:16:40,783
this. . Right, sure, you're some track compass down here.

7394
07:16:40,784 --> 07:16:43,422
Whatever. Change your laws.

7395
07:16:43,423 --> 07:16:46,189
They've also been different, different interface.

7396
07:16:46,190 --> 07:16:49,164
Please. And, uh, different things. Do you have any other change orders from here,

7397
07:16:49,165 --> 07:16:51,814
too? Do you have any change orders? Umm,

7398
07:16:51,825 --> 07:16:54,192
yeah, I'll enter my change orders from here,

7399
07:16:54,193 --> 07:16:57,882
come on. I haven't had any projects since we've gone through all this,

7400
07:16:57,883 --> 07:17:01,326
uh, that-that-that huge amount of change orders.

7401
07:17:01,327 --> 07:17:04,215
Uh, I-I- I do still the traffic separately,

7402
07:17:04,216 --> 07:17:06,293
you know, getting a nice style sheet of water,

7403
07:17:06,294 --> 07:17:08,667
because it's a lot of customerability to see that. Yeah.

7404
07:17:09,216 --> 07:17:11,596
I don't think so. I think I'd see you too. But anything that I

7405
07:17:11,597 --> 07:17:15,242
can possibly use in this program for,

7406
07:17:15,243 --> 07:17:18,671
I use Pro. So.

7407
07:17:18,672 --> 07:17:22,274
I know you're not tracking many more sweet people's own and really be able

7408
07:17:22,345 --> 07:17:25,564
to look at it. Uh, usually when there's a business,

7409
07:17:25,565 --> 07:17:30,420
it's not you. You

7410
07:17:30,421 --> 07:17:32,302
can do, or after it's paying out, but you can do the pay out

7411
07:17:32,303 --> 07:17:34,691
over there or something, whatever there is, right? Um. Bye.

7412
07:17:34,692 --> 07:17:39,324
We were going to talk about it. Is there a meeting for that?

7413
07:17:39,494 --> 07:17:41,696
Yeah, it's something on our list of steps. I mean,

7414
07:17:41,697 --> 07:17:44,892
it affects increases. Let's do Okay. We had it on there just because that

7415
07:17:44,899 --> 07:17:48,244
was part of what our passion is from the last time that I was,

7416
07:17:48,245 --> 07:17:50,771
um, trying to figure out.

7417
07:17:50,772 --> 07:17:55,220
The importance of it, yep, and an attention to the thing was way.

7418
07:17:56,260 --> 07:17:58,693
I know about it, it's a fall already.

7419
07:17:58,694 --> 07:18:02,809
you think that they shouldn't have other things that are done external.

7420
07:18:02,810 --> 07:18:06,717
yep, so it's more of a me and Margo.

7421
07:18:06,718 --> 07:18:11,542
Are A large project, then we want to use something

7422
07:18:11,543 --> 07:18:13,766
like that. It's something that's longer on and out.

7423
07:18:13,767 --> 07:18:18,436
That's what we're doing. So it's like your project's due to the production

7424
07:18:18,437 --> 07:18:24,072
of Billy and the abortion. Um. You

7425
07:18:24,073 --> 07:18:29,201
know, the function, uh, ehm, you actually seen the

7426
07:18:29,202 --> 07:18:31,856
involves your payout to you. You keep the client,

7427
07:18:31,857 --> 07:18:34,496
or does that name smile, or does it count?

7428
07:18:35,006 --> 07:18:39,016
That's true. Yeah. Two thousand and I think that's the deal.

7429
07:18:39,017 --> 07:18:44,539
That's the deal. That's the

7430
07:18:44,540 --> 07:18:47,051
deal.

7431
07:18:47,052 --> 07:18:49,098
You the bottom, the chisis,

7432
07:18:49,099 --> 07:18:51,754
the, the, the front of the front of the front of the rear wheels

7433
07:18:52,434 --> 07:18:54,947
and the brake. Uh, that, 14 of it.

7434
07:18:54,948 --> 07:18:57,692
You will do, uhm,

7435
07:18:57,703 --> 07:19:01,249
that's the fact that there will be a bunch of others and then the

7436
07:19:01,250 --> 07:19:05,183
rest is built upon completion of them. And then usually I'll reach me here

7437
07:19:05,184 --> 07:19:07,828
for a moment if you chow us in. Hey, you're gonna chow us as

7438
07:19:07,829 --> 07:19:09,939
I have to like a simple month for you to see again.

7439
07:19:09,940 --> 07:19:12,488
Come on. 40% this month,

7440
07:19:12,489 --> 07:19:14,540
the next month, I'm 60% the next month,

7441
07:19:14,541 --> 07:19:16,598
I'm 90%. Um,

7442
07:19:16,609 --> 07:19:19,211
Loom was kind of that way. Um. I don't know.

7443
07:19:19,212 --> 07:19:23,251
But, um, even then, that was started in,

7444
07:19:24,032 --> 07:19:26,542
in November, and for me to be completed probably.

7445
07:19:26,543 --> 07:19:28,616
Bye Uh, first week of the summer,

7446
07:19:28,617 --> 07:19:32,501
uh, started. Okay, so yeah, so you're not doing anything else.

7447
07:19:32,578 --> 07:19:35,291
It's, it's usually, uh, uh, more.

7448
07:19:35,292 --> 07:19:38,527
Most, not most of our projects are done over a month.

7449
07:19:38,975 --> 07:19:42,696
So, we'll, we'll go through that again maybe more in,

7450
07:19:42,697 --> 07:19:45,404
You sure can be dangerous by sure.

7451
07:19:45,405 --> 07:19:49,233
So, it's useful to you. Market will be ending in a beautiful day tomorrow

7452
07:19:49,234 --> 07:19:51,371
and it's happening here, so it'll be,

7453
07:19:51,372 --> 07:19:53,661
I'm going through everything then.

7454
07:19:54,475 --> 07:19:56,889
So, Project Schedule, you are doing it.

7455
07:19:56,890 --> 07:19:59,416
Yup. Um. Thank you.

7456
07:19:59,417 --> 07:20:01,428
That's pretty much anything, right?

7457
07:20:01,530 --> 07:20:04,467
So, yeah, we did everything. Project Schedule,

7458
07:20:04,601 --> 07:20:07,456
we did everything.

7459
07:20:07,457 --> 07:20:09,583
Trim up next, never me,

7460
07:20:09,584 --> 07:20:12,787
and then let's see if I'll, everything's uploaded and trimmed it.

7461
07:20:13,822 --> 07:20:16,708
So, there's your dunce of other things. . Just,

7462
07:20:17,569 --> 07:20:21,217
just, just, ah, no, I'm gonna get an example of 2-5-0.

7463
07:20:21,218 --> 07:20:31,540
So, 1-5-5, ah, lets- This one,-

7464
07:20:31,541 --> 07:20:34,283
essentially,

7465
07:20:34,284 --> 07:20:36,358
production-wise, the length. So,

7466
07:20:36,359 --> 07:20:38,832
well, I've sensed that as if it's a customer,

7467
07:20:38,833 --> 07:20:42,170
it's the pun. Bye-bye. And, uh, so, educating him all that,

7468
07:20:42,171 --> 07:20:45,241
what is Triple Connect going, this new model,

7469
07:20:45,242 --> 07:20:47,389
where you are, and so, getting very much.

7470
07:20:47,390 --> 07:20:51,980
Thanks for your attention. I did use that

7471
07:20:51,981 --> 07:20:54,752
when I was a day of steel,

7472
07:20:54,753 --> 07:20:54,752
and I was connected, so I get straight to the wall, from within a

7473
07:20:54,753 --> 07:20:58,867
tab. Yeah. I didn't add any more calories and calories on material settings,

7474
07:20:58,868 --> 07:21:01,430
but she said she said she could say this. We have a lot of,

7475
07:21:01,431 --> 07:21:03,791
like, info days to allow it. Umm, like, yeah.

7476
07:21:03,792 --> 07:21:05,900
And it's just so awesome. Yeah,

7477
07:21:05,901 --> 07:21:08,259
he said, okay, this is built. It's one color.

7478
07:21:08,538 --> 07:21:11,233
This is, this is already installed. It's another color.

7479
07:21:11,234 --> 07:21:14,666
Yeah. I know. It's all there. What happens to this?

7480
07:21:14,667 --> 07:21:17,076
It is. Other cuts.

7481
07:21:17,077 --> 07:21:19,704
So much. Start that way.

7482
07:21:19,705 --> 07:21:23,719
You It's such a good way to get proactive on jobs,

7483
07:21:23,720 --> 07:21:26,515
so rather than re-empt it to OSGenie without this value.

7484
07:21:26,516 --> 07:21:30,135
I love you. I just like to say a handout about this.

7485
07:21:30,141 --> 07:21:34,805
So the stuff that you're doing is attaching to the trimmel connect,

7486
07:21:35,035 --> 07:21:39,580
but the stuff- Yep. The wrong and proper doing is not,

7487
07:21:40,550 --> 07:21:43,936
because it's not for you. They're not ready to production.

7488
07:21:43,937 --> 07:21:46,948
And they're in the sense. But it's somebody's project,

7489
07:21:46,949 --> 07:21:49,380
which I'll study to you. Hmm.

7490
07:21:50,147 --> 07:21:52,746
Some project, man, you know, there you go. Um,

7491
07:21:52,747 --> 07:21:57,180
well, I guess at the end of select school,

7492
07:21:57,181 --> 07:21:59,771
electricals, and has helped me in my life like humans.

7493
07:21:59,772 --> 07:22:02,552
What does it look like? To be added to this system a bit,

7494
07:22:02,620 --> 07:22:05,676
you But you're running directly in Bitbucket,

7495
07:22:05,818 --> 07:22:08,051
right here in the goods structure and design it, right?

7496
07:22:08,052 --> 07:22:10,930
So, who is managing those jobs?

7497
07:22:10,931 --> 07:22:13,553
Uh, they're getting, they're getting production new,

7498
07:22:13,554 --> 07:22:17,745
uhm. We'll see you and they're getting involved with us.

7499
07:22:18,094 --> 07:22:20,750
So us, if, if, if it's not,

7500
07:22:20,751 --> 07:22:22,852
you know, then we can do that.

7501
07:22:22,914 --> 07:22:27,106
Okay. So. Sometimes you wouldn't manage a job that they got.

7502
07:22:27,223 --> 07:22:29,329
Yeah. And then, in that case,

7503
07:22:29,330 --> 07:22:31,606
you would actually put it in a couple of minutes.

7504
07:22:31,829 --> 07:22:36,297
Yep. You had fun with my speaker. And the thumbs you don't get them

7505
07:22:36,298 --> 07:22:40,211
all here. Is that, You call it,

7506
07:22:41,125 --> 07:22:43,934
What's, what's the reason behind that? I'm not supposed to call it somewhere,

7507
07:22:43,983 --> 07:22:47,261
I guess, to go and say, umm, you know, people wouldn't get them all,

7508
07:22:47,566 --> 07:22:50,234
it depends on, the project itself,

7509
07:22:50,235 --> 07:22:52,868
so, like, you know, like, he's not a one next video.

7510
07:22:52,921 --> 07:22:55,918
I don't even, I don't even get cat files for those who have to

7511
07:22:55,949 --> 07:22:58,551
draw. You know, all of our play files are there in me.

7512
07:22:58,552 --> 07:23:00,657
Uh, they will give us cat files,

7513
07:23:00,658 --> 07:23:02,678
we'll just get a drawing package. Yeah, uh,

7514
07:23:02,689 --> 07:23:05,536
but most of them started. You maybe 10,

7515
07:23:05,537 --> 07:23:08,196
I believe that most have some, some deans,

7516
07:23:08,197 --> 07:23:11,283
some common abilities. So, uhm,

7517
07:23:11,294 --> 07:23:14,390
but yeah, a lot. You you're getting the nice enough.

7518
07:23:14,787 --> 07:23:17,313
Yeah, uhm, so. Totally,

7519
07:23:17,314 --> 07:23:19,872
that reference, you know, you shouldn't be doing this.

7520
07:23:19,873 --> 07:23:22,581
this week. This thought about visibility.

7521
07:23:22,582 --> 07:23:24,612
Yeah. And then also,

7522
07:23:24,613 --> 07:23:27,253
uhm, we went right to our house guys.

7523
07:23:27,889 --> 07:23:30,137
Yeah, me. . Yeah. And that, that's,

7524
07:23:30,603 --> 07:23:33,345
that's to even the same level. Dropping back,

7525
07:23:33,346 --> 07:23:36,379
umm, on your drawings and training.

7526
07:23:36,380 --> 07:23:39,375
Okay. And I is the metals.

7527
07:23:39,376 --> 07:23:41,786
Are you able to get a PFXP file that important to your animals?

7528
07:23:41,805 --> 07:23:44,355
Yeah. True, using that on there. True.

7529
07:23:44,356 --> 07:23:46,356
You are only tailors?

7530
07:23:46,544 --> 07:23:50,203
Yes. Okay. Cool. That is a part of our design standard.

7531
07:23:50,204 --> 07:23:54,066
We have, I guess, a file through our ancient. Appreciate We have educational packages

7532
07:23:54,349 --> 07:23:58,825
that are detailed by us. Anything that customers apply,

7533
07:23:58,826 --> 07:24:01,564
it's a plus. Thank you very much. Confluence.

7534
07:24:01,694 --> 07:24:03,820
Where you control it, you can get it.

7535
07:24:03,821 --> 07:24:08,448
There you go. So. With that.

7536
07:24:08,449 --> 07:24:13,374
then. with our file. Uhm.

7537
07:24:13,385 --> 07:24:16,445
In, uhm.

7538
07:24:16,456 --> 07:24:19,228
True. You look at all the other things in project management and with this

7539
07:24:19,229 --> 07:24:22,214
little ton of journaling,

7540
07:24:22,215 --> 07:24:24,736
tree, and task list and check list like things.

7541
07:24:24,737 --> 07:24:27,434
. . . What's going to be for a little bit anyway? Even,

7542
07:24:27,435 --> 07:24:30,354
even, even the task list wise,

7543
07:24:30,890 --> 07:24:33,416
I don't know, I don't have anything, I have a little check. I said,

7544
07:24:33,417 --> 07:24:38,246
we are in, yeah, I had three or four

7545
07:24:38,247 --> 07:24:40,357
laners, this was helpful. Yeah,

7546
07:24:40,358 --> 07:24:42,837
I didn't. I didn't see any of the use of what was going on

7547
07:24:42,838 --> 07:24:45,254
in the company. Ask me, b****,

7548
07:24:45,260 --> 07:24:47,557
where are people here? Yeah, yeah.

7549
07:24:47,969 --> 07:24:50,722
It's, it's the- I'm here with people who aren't at the school.

7550
07:24:51,159 --> 07:24:53,558
I'm going to shop some where they have started to get that on.

7551
07:24:53,559 --> 07:24:56,193
Basically, the same thing that appreciates this.

7552
07:24:56,405 --> 07:25:00,836
Come. Okay. So we'll see a nice and magnate sandwich. This entire checklist is

7553
07:25:00,837 --> 07:25:04,184
based off of the procedure.

7554
07:25:04,185 --> 07:25:08,147
Thank you. I have four project leaders,

7555
07:25:08,443 --> 07:25:10,632
which is our project.

7556
07:25:11,268 --> 07:25:14,710
Check this. Which,

7557
07:25:14,761 --> 07:25:17,359
essentially, it is not your check box.

7558
07:25:17,360 --> 07:25:20,255
It's not your flow. Organize release folder.

7559
07:25:20,455 --> 07:25:23,847
Save the box. For open drives and management jobs,

7560
07:25:23,848 --> 07:25:26,598
for all information provided, in progress,

7561
07:25:26,599 --> 07:25:28,859
use of production controls, so that you can see it.

7562
07:25:28,860 --> 07:25:32,271
And people else, not relevant if you have an existing,

7563
07:25:32,272 --> 07:25:34,684
um, fixed amount of material,

7564
07:25:35,019 --> 07:25:39,586
make sure everything else checked. better. I'm not going to be able to apply

7565
07:25:39,587 --> 07:25:44,390
the routing. My

7566
07:25:44,391 --> 07:25:49,060
cheers. Thank you. I'm do all this using components to play at least PCA

7567
07:25:49,167 --> 07:25:52,547
for the angle of materials.

7568
07:25:52,548 --> 07:25:55,143
Good news. For the purchase of other names,

7569
07:25:55,144 --> 07:25:58,257
uh, based upon one of the two of those,

7570
07:25:58,258 --> 07:26:01,141
you can really inventory for stock.

7571
07:26:01,142 --> 07:26:04,170
Bye. I'm gonna use yard draw, set off cues down,

7572
07:26:04,171 --> 07:26:09,256

proceed with work packages, prepare for any of the work you can leave in.

7575
07:26:16,466 --> 07:26:20,400
Add a house door. Remember that each is one store package is complete.

7576
07:26:20,697 --> 07:26:23,065
Generally, we are going to try out another B.L.O.

7577
07:26:23,066 --> 07:26:25,176

airports are generated. Do your tightness things.

7580
07:26:30,346 --> 07:26:33,371
So this is where we've been saving,...

7581
07:26:33,372 --> 07:26:37,423
Our files in the drawing mods.

7582
07:26:37,424 --> 07:26:40,075
Um, Link, I haven't seen my own touch at night.

7583
07:26:40,092 --> 07:26:44,594
We haven't even had users. These We've been burning a lot

7584
07:26:44,690 --> 07:26:47,286
in the state, uh, Project Management, Proceeding, Trello, Middle, Script, Education,

7589
07:27:01,036 --> 07:27:05,269

07:27:12,756 --> 07:27:14,859
you know, each other's. . I'm going to break down this app here.

7593
07:27:15,332 --> 07:27:18,908
I'll break out in the game chart for a couple of different updates.

7594
07:27:18,909 --> 07:27:21,616
I'll just schedule a production schedule released.

7595
07:27:21,617 --> 07:27:24,397
There's a vacation chart in London.

7596
07:27:25,393 --> 07:27:27,702
We've told one of these doctors every time we get it.

7597
07:27:28,262 --> 07:27:31,758
We should send it back to people. So it's an A-stock on that.

7598
07:27:32,617 --> 07:27:36,733
Erm, Medo. The other stuff from the project is going to be the end

7613
07:28:25,169 --> 07:28:28,613

7614
07:28:29,028 --> 07:28:31,780
Yeah. Yeah. Some days, I've had.

7615
07:28:32,643 --> 07:28:34,746
Bye. I've had that.

7616
07:28:36,160 --> 07:28:38,638
So you're combining and purchasing,

7620
07:28:47,598 --> 07:28:50,051
purchasing here. Cheers.

7621
07:28:50,052 --> 07:28:54,645
And then we also broke around,

7622
07:28:54,946 --> 07:28:58,096
so, uhm, we created all of these nice things.

7623
07:28:58,097 --> 07:29:01,162
. . ECN students for the equivalent of property,

7624
07:29:01,163 --> 07:29:03,385
uhm, I specifically,

7625
07:29:03,386 --> 07:29:06,131
I'm only in the self-evocation work.

7626
07:29:06,132 --> 07:29:10,780
Umm, MediRoute will be my own processing or get easy enrolled

7627
07:29:10,781 --> 07:29:15,546
as something I specifically enrolled. Okay. Um. Bye And then I'll interact

7628
07:29:15,547 --> 07:29:19,790
all of that too much kind of spindles, uhm,

7629
07:29:19,801 --> 07:29:22,216
and then we create,

7630
07:29:22,217 --> 07:29:25,054
ehm, contact this,

7631
07:29:25,137 --> 07:29:29,040
and then, uh,

7632
07:29:29,041 --> 07:29:32,502
uhm, so I guess, Once everything is imported,

7633
07:29:32,691 --> 07:29:36,650
sequence the mod, or you leave, and it moves throughout it,

7634
07:29:37,362 --> 07:29:42,026
and then, for packages,

7635
07:29:42,500 --> 07:29:44,947
and then, got us. Unless,

7636
07:29:45,357 --> 07:29:49,663
nah. Thank you. Find more than what's just so that our B-lines and our

7637
07:29:49,664 --> 07:29:53,907
B-line reflects word packages and everything in the shop ground.

7638
07:29:53,908 --> 07:29:56,224
We've got a room. And then we see all those reports.

7639
07:29:56,527 --> 07:30:01,131
Everything's all stretched the same, so we go into any of these folders.

7640
07:30:01,132 --> 07:30:03,701
Um. Bye-bye. It's the,

7641
07:30:03,702 --> 07:30:05,982
uh, releases,

7642
07:30:06,399 --> 07:30:09,820
sequence one, a lot one, shot the ports. words.

7643
07:30:08,873 --> 07:30:13,442
// I ended up releasing multiple statements about

7644
07:30:13,443 --> 07:30:15,929
an S, but everything is built on materials,

7645
07:30:15,934 --> 07:30:18,304
everything needs plugs, traveler, room-down.

7646
07:30:18,305 --> 07:30:20,474
// I'm gonna spell this, spell this,

7647
07:30:20,475 --> 07:30:22,815
replay it, uhm. And that,

7648
07:30:22,816 --> 07:30:25,715
here's how I'm gonna shot. Let's go about to the shot for word.

7649
07:30:25,716 --> 07:30:28,141
// If you got tablets,

7650
07:30:28,142 --> 07:30:30,839
what's up with the shot? Just because,

7651
07:30:30,840 --> 07:30:34,240
uhm, this has kinda just been a part of our procedure.

7652
07:30:34,304 --> 07:30:37,327
Now. // Ah, we're going to take a bit of this point,

7653
07:30:37,328 --> 07:30:40,702
still have his, but for people, we post everyone on to,

7654
07:30:40,703 --> 07:30:43,957
uh, women in the studio. Yeah. Time one or two,

7655
07:30:44,314 --> 07:30:48,028
oh, again, I've never figured out on him. Last day, he was a physical

7656
07:30:48,029 --> 07:30:50,112
people with points. It must be,

7657
07:30:50,113 --> 07:30:54,564
ah, man. The hat is,

7658
07:30:54,565 --> 07:31:05,767
ah, man. And

7659
07:31:05,768 --> 07:31:08,923
also part of the it's just so that we have ratchet of it as

7660
07:31:08,924 --> 07:31:11,952
well. Uh,

7661
07:31:11,962 --> 07:31:14,399
then I think it's going to be, you know, the original, right here is

7662
07:31:14,400 --> 07:31:17,553
the bullet. all of us. And, uh, what's the shop traveler?

7663
07:31:17,554 --> 07:31:20,813
Shop traveler is essential.

7664
07:31:20,814 --> 07:31:22,816
Cheers.

7665
07:31:22,817 --> 07:31:28,457
Especially just the assemblies and quantities that are associated in that description

7666
07:31:28,458 --> 07:31:30,648
and fit better well. Love.

7667
07:31:30,649 --> 07:31:33,799
Love. And they've filled out of it?

7668
07:31:33,800 --> 07:31:36,364
Yeah, they hope they're used. They know a lot more. Guys about this,

7669
07:31:36,365 --> 07:31:38,464
uh, more advice on this. They know a lot.

7670
07:31:38,465 --> 07:31:40,533
All right. . Okay. So, um.

7671
07:31:46,931 --> 07:31:51,644
Oh,

7672
07:31:51,645 --> 07:31:54,008
is he here? He's wrong. He couldn't go away from me in this.

7673
07:31:54,462 --> 07:31:56,879
Yeah. Go ahead. Because that,

7674
07:31:56,880 --> 07:32:00,430
uh, yeah, we needed the energy of a paper cutness,

7675
07:32:00,431 --> 07:32:02,776
uh, and revisions.

7676
07:32:02,777 --> 07:32:04,782
So it's, yeah,

7677
07:32:04,875 --> 07:32:09,190
that can be solved as it burns in a long time,

7678
07:32:09,191 --> 07:32:11,377
but it's definitely burns before. Yeah. See ya. Yeah.

7679
07:32:12,281 --> 07:32:14,491
So I could tell some bad stories,

7680
07:32:15,202 --> 07:32:18,078
you know, obviously. But then,

7681
07:32:18,079 --> 07:32:20,557
uh, yeah. And all of our other,

7682
07:32:20,558 --> 07:32:23,287
other fitness things started here.

7683
07:32:23,288 --> 07:32:26,965
I mean, this is better. This is what needs to be made.

7684
07:32:26,966 --> 07:32:29,200
You became a fully distribution of everything.

7685
07:32:29,497 --> 07:32:32,110
Anything all different from a prep holder,

7686
07:32:32,111 --> 07:32:35,112
uh, anything new is up.

7687
07:32:35,113 --> 07:32:37,725
A It's located in here, and also updated in here.

7688
07:32:37,726 --> 07:32:41,860
I call it as well. So, I'm here. Okay.

7689
07:32:43,696 --> 07:32:46,741
Okay. Umm.

7690
07:32:46,941 --> 07:32:47,314
You

7691
07:32:51,791 --> 07:32:56,101
And once,

7692
07:32:57,173 --> 07:32:59,527
once we have all of that information,

7693
07:32:59,528 --> 07:33:04,243
we both put together- There go. And it's added things to the dialogue,

7694
07:33:04,244 --> 07:33:08,334
which we can take a look here in the background.

7695
07:33:08,335 --> 07:33:12,545
and for this, then we'll take all those sharp parts,

7696
07:33:12,588 --> 07:33:15,947
all the drawings, everything you've written, it's all the planning and releasing them for.

7697
07:33:15,958 --> 07:33:19,355
All right. They've been having to the drawing while I'm successful.

7698
07:33:19,690 --> 07:33:23,542
So, all of that is all saved in here.

7699
07:33:24,154 --> 07:33:29,063
Man. and in the associative areas and then transmittals

7700
07:33:29,064 --> 07:33:31,863
are created for any of our shot. Alright,

7701
07:33:31,864 --> 07:33:34,441
good job. This is the rest of the board.

7702
07:33:36,998 --> 07:33:40,150
Oh, and then once I know how that is,

7703
07:33:40,151 --> 07:33:44,585
I'll put it in here, but then, I'll email that portion out.

7704
07:33:45,216 --> 07:33:48,349
So, that's it, that's it. And,

7705
07:33:49,204 --> 07:33:52,296
share my- . . .

. . though.

7712
07:34:13,811 --> 07:34:16,856
I have a mind that's what the process did in the following phases.

7713
07:34:16,860 --> 07:34:18,933
It's all of those who couldn't type of size,

7714
07:34:19,342 --> 07:34:21,519
participated in all the radiation materials.

7715
07:34:21,520 --> 07:34:25,256
you have one, and then it means specific notes,

7716
07:34:25,257 --> 07:34:28,416
uh, and then every time there's a lot of other tones,

7717
07:34:28,995 --> 07:34:31,802
and this one is- the boxes, um,

7718
07:34:31,812 --> 07:34:33,856
each box, length,

7719
07:34:34,233 --> 07:34:37,811
and it's only sequence and a lot of in hours associated with it.

7720
07:34:37,812 --> 07:34:40,213
And it's,

7721
07:34:40,570 --> 07:34:45,073
okay, it's later code, it's going to specs and production

7722
07:34:45,074 --> 07:34:47,663
schedules for each. THANKS FOR WATCHING. So,

7723
07:34:47,664 --> 07:34:51,385
uh, uhm, the information I'm going to turn into,

7724
07:34:51,633 --> 07:34:54,560
right, Management, Eight. That was my Bye.

7725
07:34:54,561 --> 07:34:57,137
I'm not Are all of those lots a,

7726
07:34:57,138 --> 07:34:59,642
uhm,

7727
07:34:59,653 --> 07:35:04,598
separate work package? Thank you very No.

7728
07:35:08,329 --> 07:35:10,811
No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

7729
07:35:10,812 --> 07:35:13,683
I apologize, I hate the time. You know what I'm gonna use on this?

7730
07:35:14,017 --> 07:35:16,860
All that's all I'm gonna get is fine. That's not a template.

7731
07:35:17,152 --> 07:35:21,717
Certainly. Thank you. That takes a lot of time to talk about what

7732
07:35:21,718 --> 07:35:24,732
I'm just, I'm lazy. Can you let me,

7733
07:35:24,733 --> 07:35:27,796
umm. Yeah, so. You Yeah,

7734
07:35:27,797 --> 07:35:32,925
this is also what we use before.

7735
07:35:34,816 --> 07:35:37,700
Or updates for the team. So, uhm,

7736
07:35:37,711 --> 07:35:41,165
Octavant, I think this one's a little bit different because the PM and P

7737
07:35:41,210 --> 07:35:43,683
here are obviously bookmarking here. You know, yeah,

7738
07:35:43,734 --> 07:35:45,846
but a lot of times it'll be bubbling.

7739
07:35:46,291 --> 07:35:48,371
These are 8-5 listening at all.

7740
07:35:48,581 --> 07:35:51,412
So, if they're on any delays with- material,

7741
07:35:51,413 --> 07:35:53,571
it's supposed to go to this email for it,

7742
07:35:53,572 --> 07:35:55,576
so that'll be- it's easily tracked for everyone.

7743
07:35:55,577 --> 07:35:58,604
Um, if they're on our, um,

7744
07:35:58,615 --> 07:36:02,143
was- the project is completely complete, and it's looking into the coins,

7745
07:36:02,151 --> 07:36:04,050
and you're supposed to have an eye on it, and you won't lose some

7746
07:36:04,090 --> 07:36:06,856
of them in the email about getting this, and hey, this is not complete.

7747
07:36:06,857 --> 07:36:10,867
But in terms of the coins, it's supposed to be the same thing.

7748
07:36:10,868 --> 07:36:13,572
Um, it doesn't get realized that the way it should do it best,

7749
07:36:13,873 --> 07:36:16,168
how it's served. And we'll set it to go deaf.

7750
07:36:16,853 --> 07:36:19,133
So, uh, and all that,

7751
07:36:19,134 --> 07:36:21,282
if you've done it with automated reports, so,

7752
07:36:21,283 --> 07:36:25,635
uh, hi. Good. Good. I have no sympathy for people who are too lazy

7753
07:36:25,636 --> 07:36:28,161
to go and look at the system and up and then look up.

7754
07:36:28,629 --> 07:36:30,675
I had a similar sympathy already.

7755
07:36:30,676 --> 07:36:35,233
for me. I think the problems with that was that I was just then

7756
07:36:35,234 --> 07:36:37,371
calling us and asking for another day.

7757
07:36:37,372 --> 07:36:41,208
Get out of here. Come on. Then we open the system.

7758
07:36:41,357 --> 07:36:43,429
I was prepared at that sort of, well,

7759
07:36:43,430 --> 07:36:45,629
we got your, you know, on the token pull,

7760
07:36:45,630 --> 07:36:47,897
you were probably pretty. We're done. It's like,

7761
07:36:48,009 --> 07:36:50,139
I've worked out here to tell us it's a big,

7762
07:36:50,140 --> 07:36:53,655
like a big. The most perfect manager is the perfect.

7763
07:36:54,161 --> 07:36:56,733
Thank you. Good. I'm going do it all. First, I'm going to do it

7764
07:36:56,734 --> 07:37:02,082
all. Half, second. One,

7765
07:37:02,083 --> 07:37:05,466
two, three. We'll see all construction of missing kids.

7766
07:37:05,467 --> 07:37:09,061
Do they have a new ticket? Okay.

7767
07:37:09,707 --> 07:37:14,107
Ready? Good. Uh,

7768
07:37:14,118 --> 07:37:16,235
it's a good place to ever use it for me.

7769
07:37:17,067 --> 07:37:19,700
Like I used it some, but, uh, so we can do it all the

7770
07:37:19,701 --> 07:37:22,462
time now. Yes, does. It's. The, uhm,

7771
07:37:22,463 --> 07:37:25,538
uh, also is a lot popular in our forums,

7772
07:37:25,539 --> 07:37:28,636
whatever. But the danger here is,

7773
07:37:28,637 --> 07:37:35,599
YouTube has to get somewhere else. N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N.

7774
07:37:35,600 --> 07:37:38,291
Good luck. That's, uhm,

7775
07:37:38,302 --> 07:37:40,381
that, and that's not just,

7776
07:37:40,382 --> 07:37:42,685
uhm, yeah, uhm,

7777
07:37:42,695 --> 07:37:44,988
sure. I'll be thinking,

7778
07:37:44,989 --> 07:37:48,619
well, there's a shop in Brooklyn, I've been doing three times because I've lost

7779
07:37:48,620 --> 07:37:51,279
it here. You do that as, uhm,

7780
07:37:51,290 --> 07:37:54,318
twice. And- and you can take it and you're like,

7781
07:37:54,319 --> 07:37:56,525
yeah, it's, uh,

7782
07:37:56,536 --> 07:37:59,203
cuz no problem yet, it's not going to be. So,

7783
07:37:59,883 --> 07:38:02,085
yeah. There. Thanks so . But it, it would be,

7784
07:38:02,098 --> 07:38:05,135
I don't know if you're just a good part, but you're a good person.

7785
07:38:05,244 --> 07:38:08,831
You Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Never.

7786
07:38:08,832 --> 07:38:11,548
Yeah, we'll definitely, definitely have it same page.

7787
07:38:12,522 --> 07:38:14,693
It's a university. It would be important.

7788
07:38:15,401 --> 07:38:18,770
Yeah. They seem real. you get boosted in tech over there.

7789
07:38:18,864 --> 07:38:21,499
That means, even this morning, they were all in.

7790
07:38:21,764 --> 07:38:24,809
Yes, maybe they're all in. All your PMs over here.

7791
07:38:24,810 --> 07:38:27,267
You were front of it, and then everybody knew the P.E.E.X.

7792
07:38:27,268 --> 07:38:31,250
and the P.E.X. admin was all of the all of the other people who

7793
07:38:31,251 --> 07:38:33,354
are already underbicious. Thank you for your idea.

7794
07:38:33,463 --> 07:38:36,797
Yeah. That I've been using Trello.

7795
07:38:36,798 --> 07:38:39,917
We did all of the stuff that he's pointing at.

7796
07:38:40,197 --> 07:38:43,464
They were the ones that- In the transmittals, there are those who did verify

7797
07:38:43,537 --> 07:38:45,729
that they were the ones that took the drive and talked to me and

7798
07:38:45,730 --> 07:38:49,626
the system. They filled out all the stuff they were- was that pulled out

7799
07:38:49,627 --> 07:38:51,938
the trigger from the neck and said, okay, I got this check now.

7800
07:38:51,939 --> 07:38:53,936
I got this check now. I got check now. I I got that company.

7801
07:38:53,946 --> 07:38:56,961
I'm meeting guys for two weeks now. The system.

7802
07:38:56,962 --> 07:39:00,250
Uh, 10.

7803
07:39:00,251 --> 07:39:02,430
Today I feel that's really good.

7804
07:39:02,594 --> 07:39:04,931
All the brother getting ears and all the rest.

7805
07:39:04,932 --> 07:39:07,458
And project managers, they are all on it.

7806
07:39:07,459 --> 07:39:10,241
They all do, all that stuff, but in this city.

7807
07:39:11,584 --> 07:39:14,445
It's ready to be here. Yeah,

7808
07:39:14,446 --> 07:39:17,477
and, uh, go. I'm not trying to help, but I got,

7809
07:39:17,478 --> 07:39:20,094
uh, I have some, uh, uh, I have some videos on it.

7810
07:39:20,113 --> 07:39:22,635
If anybody has, It's pretty odd. 30% has,

7811
07:39:22,636 --> 07:39:26,000
uh, I've seen it work. Okay? And then,

7812
07:39:26,001 --> 07:39:28,996
this honestly is an un-tobbing Atlassian.

7813
07:39:28,997 --> 07:39:32,533
. . Well, it be a beef…eat my house would be. But the… it

7814
07:39:32,534 --> 07:39:34,573
wasn't that hard. Like,

7815
07:39:34,574 --> 07:39:38,066
you were talking about it wasn't I'm looking in there.

7816
07:39:39,373 --> 07:39:43,512
Man heads off so much. We also have the first thing I could use

7817
07:39:43,513 --> 07:39:48,063
again. We have the truth. You have a week of four or five times

7818
07:39:48,064 --> 07:39:51,952
managers, five or six other engineers.

7819
07:39:51,953 --> 07:39:54,383
Cheers. All those people are using it all,

7820
07:39:54,688 --> 07:39:57,247
and then the estimators looks like three or four engineers used to get it

7821
07:39:57,248 --> 07:40:02,858
as well. I'm about to eat me when you see I

7822
07:40:02,859 --> 07:40:06,217
don't know, but 300 shows me. They do a lot.

7823
07:40:07,283 --> 07:40:10,177
It's not, you know, 60 million. . . . . a year plus.

7824
07:40:10,923 --> 07:40:14,172
They're, when I left them a year and a half ago with MediRoute,

7825
07:40:14,727 --> 07:40:16,991
they were trying to get to a hundred and a year.

7826
07:40:16,992 --> 07:40:19,958
This is a tradeover market for three years,

7827
07:40:19,973 --> 07:40:21,974
and it's just pretty awesome right in here.

7828
07:40:22,266 --> 07:40:25,036
But in my power, it goes about two feet in front of me and

7829
07:40:25,037 --> 07:40:27,273
I have to give a mark,

7830
07:40:27,274 --> 07:40:31,644
but I really don't want to eat cookies for a little bit.

7831
07:40:32,364 --> 07:40:35,743
you I'm gonna say, I began to miss them when they told me how

7832
07:40:35,744 --> 07:40:39,052
I visited. They were in mind for a little bit this morning when they

7833
07:40:39,053 --> 07:40:42,428
talked to them. Since I knew how to text them,

7834
07:40:42,645 --> 07:40:45,712
since I've added it, then I've been following the key,

7835
07:40:46,079 --> 07:40:49,036
and I have been following it. Everything made me move up.

7836
07:40:49,037 --> 07:40:53,063
... ...and there hasn't been a lesson made in a few years,

7837
07:40:53,064 --> 07:40:56,355
and most of it became a lot of the time in the investment.

7838
07:40:56,356 --> 07:40:59,440
So, Okay. And now they're trying to push more things,

7839
07:40:59,646 --> 07:41:03,915
but it has been a, I didn't say greater than I'm sure.

7840
07:41:03,916 --> 07:41:06,602
Yeah. Done. This company and the other one,

7841
07:41:06,759 --> 07:41:10,165
it's their main news. That's tech,

7842
07:41:10,166 --> 07:41:12,897
uhm, their role is that they've got that.

7843
07:41:12,898 --> 07:41:15,936
Good. So this call came from a little girl,

7844
07:41:15,937 --> 07:41:19,183
they want to be a technical or it came from us and we pushed

7845
07:41:19,237 --> 07:41:21,577
them to that. They saw what we had, they saw. Bye. Bye-bye,

7846
07:41:21,578 --> 07:41:23,817
bye-bye. Oh, okay.

7847
07:41:23,897 --> 07:41:28,134
And I still feel it from the top. Perhaps you guys are ready.

7848
07:41:28,135 --> 07:41:31,373
We'll see later. Bye. I know it, I actually think so.

7849
07:41:31,374 --> 07:41:33,435
I've seen it.

7850
07:41:33,436 --> 07:41:36,109
Okay. Yeah. What should you do for the phone,

7851
07:41:36,110 --> 07:41:38,836
you can be the manager. Enjoy. Yep. Yep. Yep.

7852
07:41:38,957 --> 07:41:41,850
Certainly I can be expected, right? I think I'm going to be better,

7853
07:41:41,851 --> 07:41:44,455
uhm, uhm, uhm, Just go to the car.

7854
07:41:44,684 --> 07:41:47,308
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

7855
07:41:47,309 --> 07:41:52,198
That's the truth. Nick, you got it on some of these other systems.

7856
07:41:52,199 --> 07:41:55,110
Let's go. I mean, it seems like you're double,

7857
07:41:55,193 --> 07:41:57,327
at least double working. Yeah, uhm,

7858
07:41:57,337 --> 07:41:59,459
that's right. I think so, to do the,

7859
07:41:59,460 --> 07:42:01,484
uhm, a reporter, everybody. I'm ready. So,

7860
07:42:02,487 --> 07:42:04,553
after the reporter, uhm,

7861
07:42:04,564 --> 07:42:07,366
after the release,

7862
07:42:07,367 --> 07:42:11,134
and so, Receiving is,

7863
07:42:11,312 --> 07:42:14,584
that's, we're working on getting that done out there.

7864
07:42:14,585 --> 07:42:17,051
So, uhm,

7865
07:42:17,052 --> 07:42:20,314
The, uhm,

7866
07:42:20,324 --> 07:42:23,811
NTRs in London, New York, should be shipping where you're seeing this,

7867
07:42:23,812 --> 07:42:25,405
should be where you're seeing this. I'm little bit of this. Uh, well, of

7868
07:42:25,406 --> 07:42:27,669
course, I thought so.

7869
07:42:27,670 --> 07:42:31,712
Yes, sir. Alright, you're gonna have IPAs to be out.

7870
07:42:31,713 --> 07:42:33,801
I've got them in the apartment. the board. Um. Okay.

7871
07:42:34,665 --> 07:42:37,059
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And uh,

7872
07:42:37,069 --> 07:42:41,111
so you can let me just go and sit back. If please subscribe.

7873
07:42:41,112 --> 07:42:43,181
Do like, I just think it's how we see it in there.

7874
07:42:43,462 --> 07:42:46,592
And it's right last day I'll be inside a moment of the jerks here

7875
07:42:46,593 --> 07:42:49,021
in a week. Let's say I'm making a piece of that in patience.

7876
07:42:49,022 --> 07:42:51,314
You know, I can get one in the rest of the package.

7877
07:42:52,572 --> 07:42:54,987
I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm all going to try to get a job to

7878
07:42:54,988 --> 07:42:57,131
build it with. Can you show? Okay.

7879
07:42:57,132 --> 07:42:59,895
I think we're basically just being needed for it.

7880
07:43:00,109 --> 07:43:04,487
So this question was if he needed to build up a job.

7881
07:43:04,488 --> 07:43:09,208
Go. We're all looking at Kiara's plan for it.

7882
07:43:09,345 --> 07:43:12,234
Peace again. Something today. Anything you want?

7883
07:43:12,413 --> 07:43:14,552
Alright, do it. I'm showing you this is a golf ball.

7884
07:43:14,775 --> 07:43:17,436
We're a job that's where we've got three clinics and we're getting a new

7885
07:43:17,437 --> 07:43:19,451
job. So they're starting to,

7886
07:43:19,452 --> 07:43:21,887
where we were and we just. . . . Congress under,

7887
07:43:21,888 --> 07:43:26,207
because you have to know all the purchase orders and then you can pull

7888
07:43:26,208 --> 07:43:29,111
the purchase orders in one by one. Yeah. It's horrible.

7889
07:43:29,112 --> 07:43:32,545
Look at that. Too revealing to have this to the fans,

7890
07:43:32,546 --> 07:43:33,142
yeah. Thank you.

7891
07:43:37,931 --> 07:43:40,467
Hey, members, appreciate it.

7892
07:43:40,468 --> 07:43:43,303
Man, that is sweet. There's a very few without one.

7893
07:43:43,739 --> 07:43:45,962
I can't tell you that, you know,

7894
07:43:45,963 --> 07:43:50,762
I had to know. I can't the box to the connection

7895
07:43:50,763 --> 07:43:54,551
and it's so cool.

7896
07:43:54,552 --> 07:43:57,616
I got it. One of these that has a multiple.

7897
07:43:57,884 --> 07:44:00,874
This one probably has the conumbers for almost five minutes.

7898
07:44:01,818 --> 07:44:03,854
That's welcome. He's not sure how to get here.

7899
07:44:03,962 --> 07:44:06,094
So they do well. I wish you a little bit. That's good.

7900
07:44:06,095 --> 07:44:09,388
That's So they did just study documents that bothered us and all that to

7901
07:44:09,389 --> 07:44:12,062
the folder. Yeah. Thank you. Study documents,

7902
07:44:12,163 --> 07:44:16,661
and then you can also get a report that gives you a piece mark

7903
07:44:16,662 --> 07:44:18,671
by he can remember that. Bye. Bye.

7904
07:44:18,672 --> 07:44:20,835
And you gotta go and have to do any,

7905
07:44:20,836 --> 07:44:23,400
hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm,

7906
07:44:23,401 --> 07:44:26,711
hmmm. Uh, I'm only gonna have to keep us in the center but,

7907
07:44:26,712 --> 07:44:29,920
You think that they ask you how they could be all over.

7908
07:44:29,921 --> 07:44:31,987
You gotta say, he should read you all this.

7909
07:44:32,364 --> 07:44:34,751
And you can play it all over. Yeah, there we go.

7910
07:44:34,752 --> 07:44:37,163
I'm going to stay in the, the childhood cause.

7911
07:44:37,510 --> 07:44:40,407
Oh, that's a really stable, and that's how it involves that.

7912
07:44:40,408 --> 07:44:42,791
Yeah, yeah. When you, I don't know the game whether,

7913
07:44:42,792 --> 07:44:47,173
You gotta save it somewhere. So, I think that's kind of the direction on

7914
07:44:47,366 --> 07:44:50,831
the video. to help.

7915
07:44:50,832 --> 07:44:55,069
We want this project to go to the front,

7916
07:44:55,070 --> 07:44:58,780
should be received, received. You would pay the fee in the NTR.

7917
07:44:58,781 --> 07:45:01,803
you are. All the money you have made, I don't understand why we have

7918
07:45:01,804 --> 07:45:03,967
it, because it's not in addition, it's bottom. Yeah,

7919
07:45:04,086 --> 07:45:07,060
and care. But if you think that's where you just got- You know,

7920
07:45:07,061 --> 07:45:11,461
all but they're literally saved. In here,

7921
07:45:11,563 --> 07:45:14,764
at least if you have it. Yes. Yeah.

7922
07:45:14,765 --> 07:45:17,809
So- The reason we had MCR Folders is because,

7923
07:45:19,077 --> 07:45:22,303
as ASME shot, we had a certain amount of step ahead of me to

7924
07:45:22,304 --> 07:45:25,251
view it. We went- I'm putting this to the MCR Folders until I see

7925
07:45:25,252 --> 07:45:29,399
the view they'll file. The uh,

7926
07:45:29,410 --> 07:45:32,469
the thing about it, if you- just go back to follow or to pull

7927
07:45:32,470 --> 07:45:36,976
everything, that takes away your ability to be able to stop

7928
07:45:36,977 --> 07:45:39,011
and and then reset the machine. So.

7929
07:45:39,012 --> 07:45:41,935
Like, you know, the one we bought from the jobs on the bottom of

7930
07:45:41,936 --> 07:45:45,207
the sack of Keenan, I'm not going to get that out.

7931
07:45:45,354 --> 07:45:47,540
I'm going to go up top. Going. phone. Machine,

7932
07:45:47,541 --> 07:45:49,556
then I'm stalking the machine.

7933
07:45:50,002 --> 07:45:55,036
And then it's going to record the problem of the year.

7934
07:45:55,037 --> 07:45:59,404
But it won't be about over the right moment,

7935
07:45:59,405 --> 07:46:03,011
right? So it doesn't start. But, yeah. See ya.

7936
07:46:03,012 --> 07:46:05,250
That's cool, but it's awesome.

7937
07:46:05,251 --> 07:46:08,065
It does. Umm, so there you go. Okay.

7938
07:46:08,066 --> 07:46:11,647
8 8 8 8 9 8 Okay.

7939
07:46:11,648 --> 07:46:16,236
Umm, the, umm, the everything,

7940
07:46:16,945 --> 07:46:21,035
yes, and that, you know. you I'm getting the,

7941
07:46:21,036 --> 07:46:23,989
uhh, time tracking meaning all the,

7942
07:46:23,990 --> 07:46:27,071
uhh, things are changing here. I believe they're producing the time.

7943
07:46:27,072 --> 07:46:32,717
. . . . tracking through Techbud.

7944
07:46:32,718 --> 07:46:37,405
. . . . . . . . . Ok. Speak about that.

7945
07:46:37,406 --> 07:46:40,899
Ah, a uhh.. Yeah, Yeah,

7946
07:46:41,966 --> 07:46:44,664
I really didn't It's been two years or so now.

7947
07:46:44,969 --> 07:46:46,875
So if you're . . . so wait a minute, let ask you names

7948
07:46:46,876 --> 07:46:49,664
later. Or now .

7949
07:46:49,665 --> 07:46:53,915
. . you know, you've known it in a time check. You know .

7950
07:46:53,916 --> 07:46:57,504
. .

7951
07:46:57,505 --> 07:47:02,686
it's so much there. See you later. I really am,

7952
07:47:02,687 --> 07:47:05,341
man. Especially in this segment. Yeah.

7953
07:47:04,867 --> 07:47:09,867
Yeah. You

7954
07:47:09,868 --> 07:47:12,457
want a couple, but you don't have to be much in.

7955
07:47:13,121 --> 07:47:17,827
It's sense, yum. It's okay. You it's

7956
07:47:17,828 --> 07:47:18,480
ready. you

7957
07:47:23,591 --> 07:47:28,286
So I'm going to give her all of our

7958
07:47:28,287 --> 07:47:31,340
time and issues to work with. Okay, I'm going to do that.

7959
07:47:31,341 --> 07:47:35,696
That's really good. I guess I have that. So.

7960
07:47:37,146 --> 07:47:40,025
Let's give them a day on them, please.

7961
07:47:40,026 --> 07:47:43,989
And then the job, they're the mandatory stretches they have to do in the

7962
07:47:43,990 --> 07:47:47,801
morning. They're safety. That's better than it is,

7963
07:47:47,802 --> 07:47:55,320
that's like th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th

7964
07:47:55,321 --> 07:47:58,694
So, no worries. I've never seen that in shock.

7965
07:47:58,695 --> 07:48:01,760
I've never seen that in the field. You know, it's- it's- it's- it's- it's-

7966
07:48:01,801 --> 07:48:06,330
it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- is this a five-minute

7967
07:48:06,600 --> 07:48:08,697
thing or something? 10 hours, 30 solid, yeah,

7968
07:48:08,698 --> 07:48:12,016
that's all the discussions. Thank much for your attention.

7969
07:48:12,017 --> 07:48:14,047
Come into the shop and blast the chutes and test it.

7970
07:48:14,048 --> 07:48:16,958
Oh, you need to get this. Yeah, I'm gonna do a play all over

7971
07:48:16,959 --> 07:48:18,990
there, uhm, uhm,

7972
07:48:18,991 --> 07:48:28,000
uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, . . . .

7973
07:48:28,001 --> 07:48:31,326
. Plfued of Okey,chidison,

7974
07:48:31,327 --> 07:48:33,815
J.S.A. Okay, child safety.

7975
07:48:33,816 --> 07:48:36,076
Thank you guys. See you in the show.

7976
07:48:36,077 --> 07:48:39,083
Okay. He's probably testin' on J.S.A.

7977
07:48:39,084 --> 07:48:42,021
and fell down towards to the, I said, the man's in J.S.A.

7978
07:48:42,022 --> 07:48:44,404
is done in the shop. And what are you A.S.A.

7979
07:48:44,405 --> 07:48:46,867
is significant. Huh.

7980
07:48:48,003 --> 07:48:50,487
So. It's almost as good for me. That was good.

7981
07:48:50,488 --> 07:48:54,223
I didn't say it was bad. Yeah. I haven't seen you before,

7982
07:48:54,224 --> 07:48:57,172
but I'm just saying it. I'm saying you can't say it.

7983
07:48:57,173 --> 07:49:00,136
Ah, good. Just. Yes.

7984
07:49:00,137 --> 07:49:04,137
Because people in mind that we were going to talk about Sourcet on the

7985
07:49:04,138 --> 07:49:07,104
stations, it will be an addition to this.

7986
07:49:07,199 --> 07:49:09,455
Yeah. Yeah. So it's that time though.

7987
07:49:09,666 --> 07:49:14,077
Sourcetree and TJ will be over this every day and check their face scan

7988
07:49:14,078 --> 07:49:17,537
in and against what they have. you It's a 30 minute scope.

7989
07:49:18,091 --> 07:49:20,309
And 12, 12, I'll interrupt. It's not over yet. Okay. It's not correct.

7990
07:49:20,310 --> 07:49:22,346
Okay. It's not correct. Okay.

7991
07:49:22,570 --> 07:49:25,463
Okay. Oh,

7992
07:49:25,464 --> 07:49:30,130
I think it is a good job. Okay. Okay.

7993
07:49:30,131 --> 07:49:32,429
Okay. It pulls launch out of here. I'm gonna kill ya. Thank Now,

7994
07:49:32,430 --> 07:49:36,325
I know that, uh, Ted is following through on this talk.

7995
07:49:36,326 --> 07:49:40,137
Thank you. We'll be right back in August.

7996
07:49:40,138 --> 07:49:42,305
the here at the channel for, um,

7997
07:49:42,306 --> 07:49:44,404
7th and 8th or, uh, another day.

7998
07:49:44,405 --> 07:49:48,916
F*** with F*** with it.

7999
07:49:48,917 --> 07:49:51,799
What you change about, that I'm trying to hear me change.

8000
07:49:51,800 --> 07:49:55,039
Um,

8001
07:49:55,050 --> 07:49:58,168
well, one that missed the integration, you know. I was being able to settle

8002
07:49:58,169 --> 07:50:01,948
this, the engineer, and the hours, you know. I just got a little bit

8003
07:50:01,949 --> 07:50:04,006
of air clover. Um,

8004
07:50:04,016 --> 07:50:06,268
the other thing would be. You get it, it's, it's.

8005
07:50:09,528 --> 07:50:11,747
And I guess I'd be using it in your business,

8006
07:50:11,748 --> 07:50:14,699
at shops, most of them. . Umm, here, uhh,

8007
07:50:14,710 --> 07:50:17,370
in your job, and hop on your own,

8008
07:50:17,483 --> 07:50:20,027
and then clocking in and out of it physically.

8009
07:50:20,028 --> 07:50:23,105
Umm. . . And this one,

8010
07:50:23,142 --> 07:50:27,021
in an EPN go, can be a pain in the ass when you're typing

8011
07:50:27,022 --> 07:50:31,886
things in that is not adding notes to it sucks.

8012
07:50:32,142 --> 07:50:34,283
But I'll say that. So,

8013
07:50:34,284 --> 07:50:37,101
that would be the main thing. Bye.

8014
07:50:37,102 --> 07:50:40,759
Umm, I'll be done on that chart by telling you in this fashion.

8015
07:50:40,760 --> 07:50:43,142
So, don't worry, I'll put my back,

8016
07:50:43,143 --> 07:50:46,532
and I'm sure a few better than this. I don't have for us to

8017
07:50:46,533 --> 07:50:48,838
say like that. Um,

8018
07:50:48,849 --> 07:50:51,118
I don't have any. Well, as you can see though,

8019
07:50:51,119 --> 07:50:55,721
it's just a good disparity. iggle. to to 4 cumbersome for a guy against

8020
07:50:55,785 --> 07:50:57,862
jumping in this way with jobs,

8021
07:50:57,863 --> 07:51:00,473
3rd leg jumping in this way, 3rd leg jumping 3rd leg jumping in this

8022
07:51:00,474 --> 07:51:02,665
way. Stations are going from,

8023
07:51:03,057 --> 07:51:05,175
you know, fair up to a lot of it. I was going to give

8024
07:51:05,176 --> 07:51:07,904
a little bit of it to the tablet, don't you know. And I think

8025
07:51:07,905 --> 07:51:11,118
this brings a lot of intent down. A lot of the shops are going

8026
07:51:11,119 --> 07:51:14,177
to be new stations. There's a computer over there.

8027
07:51:14,441 --> 07:51:16,541
I'm going to get out of my breakfast. I'm going to show my breakfast.

8028
07:51:16,542 --> 07:51:19,620
Thank friends. All right. I've been, it's not safe. I've got to go over,

8029
07:51:19,762 --> 07:51:22,560
I got to go walking, and then I got to enter my stuff,

8030
07:51:22,561 --> 07:51:24,602
enter my job, clocking, clocking, clocking.

8031
07:51:24,603 --> 07:51:27,196
Oh, my God. I'm on a podcast in the next job, and I go

8032
07:51:27,197 --> 07:51:30,462
back, and I'm in a safe station, and I got my materials,

8033
07:51:30,463 --> 07:51:32,538
and I get back for this.

8034
07:51:32,051 --> 07:51:36,162
this. I was having a great year growing up into the goal I put

8035
07:51:36,163 --> 07:51:39,566
in here, along with this shop. We'll, we'll grow this next file to steal

8036
07:51:39,567 --> 07:51:41,656
and recommend this job. No. No. So,

8037
07:51:42,091 --> 07:51:44,768
next, I'm going to do a great, uh,

8038
07:51:44,779 --> 07:51:46,965
video of a swap job, so it is, uh,

8039
07:51:46,975 --> 07:51:49,314
because there's that style, e.n, e.n, e.n, e n,

8040
07:51:49,499 --> 07:51:51,809
e, n, e, n, e, n, e, n, n, e, e,

8042

n, n,

8048
07:52:13,156 --> 07:52:17,682
n, n, Series to think about regardless of the we're perpetuating

8049
07:52:17,683 --> 07:52:20,098
the interface for. What was the best one you'd see?

8050
07:52:20,099 --> 07:52:22,577
Thank you. Umm,

8051
07:52:22,588 --> 07:52:25,573
I don't get into a lot of people's time talks about their reason.

8052
07:52:25,904 --> 07:52:28,282
What I used to be using is about time. Plus,

8053
07:52:28,921 --> 07:52:31,857
hey, hey. I came home pretty well. I just couldn't get a bit of

8054
07:52:31,858 --> 07:52:34,893
a neat one on that. So I could, I could give you a job

8055
07:52:34,894 --> 07:52:37,216
and see what's in this, as well.

8056
07:52:37,217 --> 07:52:42,057
So, uh, so I'm going to, I have a good input on

8057
07:52:42,058 --> 07:52:45,251
what's the best thing out there.

8058
07:52:45,252 --> 07:52:47,995
. . I didn't vote on R's change to where,

8059
07:52:48,526 --> 07:52:50,817
excuse me, you can walk up, you know,

8060
07:52:50,818 --> 07:52:53,231
whatever you did last, come right back up.

8061
07:52:53,232 --> 07:52:57,309
Yeah. And the new system, you had to do it at a time.

8062
07:52:57,310 --> 07:52:59,820
It was a great experience. Yeah. You might be,

8063
07:52:59,821 --> 07:53:02,453
some guys don't talk, it's for you. Yeah. But,

8064
07:53:04,961 --> 07:53:09,311
yeah, I don't know. I really don't think about that in my game.

8065
07:53:09,312 --> 07:53:12,083
I'm living in the face of, uh,

8066
07:53:12,094 --> 07:53:14,386
this and about what they're going to do.

8067
07:53:14,387 --> 07:53:16,572
Um, you know. Good,

8068
07:53:16,573 --> 07:53:18,796
thanks. So,

8069
07:53:18,797 --> 07:53:21,179
yeah. So, what it does, what it does, what uh,

8070
07:53:21,189 --> 07:53:23,592
it just, uh, almost needs to set up all the things that are,

8071
07:53:24,374 --> 07:53:27,838
or what it does to this. So, automatically it will let you have to

8072
07:53:27,839 --> 07:53:29,917
do it. Like, automatically,

8073
07:53:29,918 --> 07:53:33,436
the integration here goes P-A-P-R-C-N.

8074
07:53:33,437 --> 07:53:36,528
. . That's it! But David jaron,ied as Lisa Sarone,

8075
07:53:36,896 --> 07:53:39,300
next 4 favourite videos is-A-N-E-L.

8076
07:53:39,301 --> 07:53:41,305
we have to get in the right form after this and then get in

8077
07:53:41,337 --> 07:53:44,094
head. That is the right thing. So,

8078
07:53:44,095 --> 07:53:46,610
how is that today? I don't know,

8079
07:53:46,611 --> 07:53:48,567
I don't know what to do with Lisa, but I don't know what to

8080
07:53:48,722 --> 07:53:51,574
Lisa, but don't know what to do with a minute,

8081
07:53:51,575 --> 07:53:56,359
and it's almost a week. So, it will begin when you take it back

8082
07:53:56,364 --> 07:53:59,752
or time. Bye-bye. Now I'm going to start with you.

8083
07:53:59,881 --> 07:54:02,482
It's a side pass for somebody else beneath the end.

8084
07:54:02,483 --> 07:54:04,503
They're ready to go. So,

8085
07:54:04,504 --> 07:54:06,508
thank you. Nah, nah,

8086
07:54:06,509 --> 07:54:09,059
I think I'm myself. No.

8087
07:54:10,781 --> 07:54:13,636
Yeah, that's pretty much,

8088
07:54:13,637 --> 07:54:17,277
. Prior to process, uh, on the passive soldier with one spot,

8089
07:54:17,278 --> 07:54:20,154
I don't know. And then,

8090
07:54:20,276 --> 07:54:23,302
er, yeah, I would be, very useful,

8091
07:54:23,303 --> 07:54:25,339
but I have more members who give this,

8092
07:54:25,340 --> 07:54:28,602
uh, understand this, and have it suited.

8093
07:54:28,603 --> 07:54:30,772
Uh, uh, All right. I'm gonna my machines,

8094
07:54:30,773 --> 07:54:33,453
I can have it in 2 or 3 and D. I'm gonna help me

8095
07:54:33,454 --> 07:54:37,575
set it. Yeah, that's the plan. I'm welcome.

8096
07:54:37,576 --> 07:54:39,906
Oh, good. I don't know about this, but,

8097
07:54:40,255 --> 07:54:42,453
you know, not all surveys and time studies,

8098
07:54:42,454 --> 07:54:44,545
I guess I learned to sweep that,

8099
07:54:44,638 --> 07:54:46,782
that's my job. It's time. . . So, uh, um,

8100
07:54:46,793 --> 07:54:49,395
I think about the, uh. . well. .

8101
07:54:49,396 --> 07:55:01,290
. so these, eh. out

8102
07:55:01,291 --> 07:55:05,439
of the system, you see. This is the last channel.

8103
07:55:05,440 --> 07:55:08,154
Still, yup,

8104
07:55:08,381 --> 07:55:10,771
none. I'm going to do that. We've already got it just to do.

8105
07:55:10,952 --> 07:55:14,993
Thank you, thank all C.I. and even responsible for all of that.

8106
07:55:14,994 --> 07:55:17,307
Yeah. We're having a while.

8107
07:55:17,308 --> 07:55:20,596
We're going to get it sometimes than this. We're having to change the spelling.

8108
07:55:20,597 --> 07:55:23,203
We're having to do this.

8109
07:55:23,976 --> 07:55:27,191
We'll be changing the spelling. We'll be pushing against that.

8110
07:55:27,192 --> 07:55:30,059
We're having if you can change it for that size.

8111
07:55:30,060 --> 07:55:34,116
Uh, yeah, we don't even have to have a C8 by 11.5.

8112
07:55:34,117 --> 07:55:36,472
I have to get crazy. Great. I see it in this thing,

8113
07:55:36,473 --> 07:55:38,757
but that's it. So, uh, uhm,

8114
07:55:38,768 --> 07:55:42,345
it's never, uhm, pushed into the room or anything you just decided it is.

8115
07:55:42,937 --> 07:55:47,748
So. So, And that's, that's something that I don't believe you

8116
07:55:47,749 --> 07:55:49,998
should accept that. So, yeah,

8117
07:55:49,999 --> 07:55:52,811
okay, I'm ready. I'm sorry. Last point, did it mark me?

8118
07:55:52,812 --> 07:55:55,515
It's something that I don't like. Yeah,

8119
07:55:55,936 --> 07:55:58,224
I didn't think you were looking at it just a minute. That's it.

8120
07:55:58,225 --> 07:56:00,861
That's it. We'll see you Happy Tuesday. So they're all right. I think this

8121
07:56:00,862 --> 07:56:04,308
should be pretty annoying at the moment. In the normal text.

8122
07:56:04,509 --> 07:56:07,051
Yeah, they're all right. So, I'll wait a minute.

8123
07:56:07,052 --> 07:56:10,559
No. Yeah, I get it. Thank you. Any quarters of the shot,

8124
07:56:10,560 --> 07:56:12,921
six, four, and a one, you take it to my start 10,

8125
07:56:12,922 --> 07:56:15,107
17, I'm so I'm gonna get it really out.

8126
07:56:15,108 --> 07:56:17,366
I love you. I haven't,

8127
07:56:17,367 --> 07:56:19,918
I think he has, umm, a hundred, yes, so he's gonna pay hard one.

8128
07:56:20,992 --> 07:56:23,231
I'm gonna get that. So that sounds good.

8129
07:56:23,232 --> 07:56:26,626
I'm not gonna miss him, Josh. Sometimes that's a challenge.

8130
07:56:26,830 --> 07:56:30,119
Man. And so he goes, me and Biddings live,

8131
07:56:30,120 --> 07:56:34,435
so he won't be hurt. . . We were picking up live for a

8132
07:56:34,436 --> 07:56:36,539
while. . . No, no, no,

8133
07:56:36,540 --> 07:56:39,256
no. It's, uhh, in each song.

8134
07:56:39,257 --> 07:56:41,504
Let's take a look. Okay.

8135
07:56:41,505 --> 07:56:44,322

8137
07:56:46,843 --> 07:56:49,213
Storyaran. Like,

8138
07:56:49,214 --> 07:56:54,065
it's, to me,

8139
07:56:54,066 --> 07:56:56,235
it's one of the biggest issues, you've It's since the curiousness. . People of

8140
07:56:56,236 --> 07:56:58,328
serious communication from the series.

8141
07:56:58,574 --> 07:57:01,210
You put the data in question, you know, that's what happened,

8142
07:57:01,211 --> 07:57:03,256
so I can follow you and figure out what's happened.

8143
07:57:03,257 --> 07:57:05,537
And that chick in the middle of the night.

8144
07:57:05,837 --> 07:57:08,725
I think it's like we're not even supposed to be working.

8145
07:57:08,812 --> 07:57:11,291
It's a communication. Nation.

8146
07:57:11,292 --> 07:57:14,939
Don't let everybody have to get a lot of time to call them.

8147
07:57:15,346 --> 07:57:17,559
You could, and I'm going to show you that.

8148
07:57:17,881 --> 07:57:20,821
We're doing the workout back now. I'm to show you guys next to this.

8151
07:57:25,493 --> 07:57:26,921

8152
07:57:26,922 --> 07:57:29,884

8153
07:57:29,885 --> 07:57:32,158
the video, the production, you know, also, uh,

8154
07:57:32,169 --> 07:57:36,191
here And if he would,

8155
07:57:36,192 --> 07:57:38,940
if he wouldn't get involved in all the time by the project,

8156
07:57:38,941 --> 07:57:41,182
then he'd be like, hey, hey, hey, hey,

8157
07:57:41,183 --> 07:57:43,271
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm gonna do this. I really,

go. If they will not mention this,

8161
07:57:52,782 --> 07:57:55,506
then I will hear what it gets. They call.

8162
07:57:55,905 --> 07:57:58,513
You should have won. I can do it. Let me take off all this

8163
07:57:58,514 --> 07:58:01,205
stuff. I mean, that will be hard.

8164
07:58:01,206 --> 07:58:03,315
We'll do it in a bit.

8165
07:58:03,520 --> 07:58:06,856
How much you don't need so much. How's it going to be this long?

8166
07:58:06,857 --> 07:58:09,416
Good morning. You know, why are you so many kids?

8167
07:58:09,422 --> 07:58:12,221
I don't know. I just, I don't know. I I don't know.

8168
07:58:12,222 --> 07:58:14,544
I've heard really good. What do we think? I have generally, it's like a

8169
07:58:14,545 --> 07:58:16,957
different thing. Take me. In fact, you should be able to do this.

8170
07:58:16,978 --> 07:58:19,983
Exactly. I'm a fan of music,

8171
07:58:19,984 --> 07:58:22,273
and I'm supposed to let you use the product in it.

8172
07:58:22,518 --> 07:58:24,649
I'm gonna make sure- Thanks to you,

8173
07:58:24,684 --> 07:58:28,121
Mark. If I just want to let you put it on in the bed.

8174
07:58:28,122 --> 07:58:31,341
Yeah, I can't plan so many interpretations. I'm looking to- Thank you.

8175
07:58:31,342 --> 07:58:33,973
Umm, and it's a point where it's safe,

8176
07:58:33,974 --> 07:58:36,157
you know, different, you know, like, oh, yeah.

8177

8181
07:58:48,012 --> 07:58:50,361
is a problem. It's like, yeah, it's a toy.

8182
07:58:50,381 --> 07:58:53,226
It's a chain that doesn't make me know inside. But if it has a

8183
07:58:53,227 --> 07:58:54,981
shock, it's gonna make a lot of place for my kids. Make to subscribe

8184
07:58:54,982 --> 07:58:57,306
to our kids. I don't even know what to do just get.

8185
07:58:57,365 --> 07:58:59,335
I know you're gonna get the wrong kids, but I can't get wrong kids,

8186
07:58:59,336 --> 07:59:01,912
couldn't you? So I'm a bit fat that's kids too much.

8187

We're going to have a little bit of a touch of the work on

8194
07:59:24,369 --> 07:59:27,371
the English research science that we have there. I wish I could still.

8195

8197
07:59:32,693 --> 07:59:35,111
It's a really nice to be thinking about it. The program that we're going

8198
07:59:35,112 --> 07:59:37,345
to think are the people I'm hanging with.
