<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15-0
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.130

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16-0
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17-0
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23-0
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.210

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35-0
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:28.806
<v Ricky Horton>I'm what they call trouble. Yeah, right.
Move around the program. Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35-1
00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Ricky Horton>I've been doing it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36-0
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.079
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes I'm trouble with that.
I know what I'm talking about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36-1
00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.570
<v Ricky Horton>I'm treating like that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37-0
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.245
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
I've been working here since 2018,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37-1
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:49.730
<v Ricky Horton>so actually five days later than my
seven-year anniversary.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38-0
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Ricky Horton>Well, seven day anniversary. Yeah. Hey,
that's very something. Yeah, you do. So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39-0
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I was done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40-0
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.283
<v Ricky Horton>I was an assistant project coordinator
and we were working in task role and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40-1
00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:17.474
<v Ricky Horton>I became the project coordinator and then
I became lead project coordinator.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40-2
00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Ricky Horton>Now I'm a shop project engineer, so cool.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41-0
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.103
<v Ricky Horton>And Jeremy, that's for sure.
I feel like I've almost been in every</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41-1
00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:34.178
<v Ricky Horton>single office on the property.
I'd rather do anything than get anywhere</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41-2
00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Ricky Horton>near project management. Yeah,
that's my main thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42-0
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.369
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
it's kind of looking like they're going</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42-1
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:48.897
<v Ricky Horton>to turn me into the tech,
so it looks like it it should be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42-2
00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be implementing that. So yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43-0
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Ricky Horton>Good morning. Good morning.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44-0
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.450
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45-0
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.316
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the ground running this morning.
Got my worm 3:30 and I've got my copy and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45-1
00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:18.246
<v Ricky Horton>I'm ready to go. Yep, I'm update.
Now I'm just doing a Microsoft update</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45-2
00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Ricky Horton>just to make sure my computer isn't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47-0
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.219
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't the issue in between.
So would you have a try and see if you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47-1
00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:32.046
<v Ricky Horton>can crash again? I tried. Yeah, I've been.
I've been in the office since 12:00 this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47-2
00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:37.666
<v Ricky Horton>morning and we haven't kept the hell on.
It's been there really nothing but love</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47-3
00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Ricky Horton>that, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/52-0
00:05:56.317 --> 00:05:59.117
<v Ricky Horton>Move the speed and move it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/61-0
00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:04.157
<v Ricky Horton>That's all right. Today she feels smaller.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/77-0
00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:09.621
<v Ricky Horton>Update went good.
We got the new database for the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/77-1
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.917
<v Ricky Horton>electrical, so we need that set up and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/104-0
00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:19.332
<v Ricky Horton>Are there people who come here?
So I think Jarrod's going to be in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/104-1
00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:24.307
<v Ricky Horton>He's going to be in.
So they'll guess also I just had to take</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/104-2
00:06:24.307 --> 00:06:27.837
<v Ricky Horton>you back and then take you down with it
so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/127-0
00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:32.834
<v Ricky Horton>My guess is once we get at least the
baseline,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/127-1
00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:38.701
<v Ricky Horton>what they're expecting established,
I'll work from home once or twice next</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/127-2
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:43.317
<v Ricky Horton>week and sit in my home office and plug
the air for, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/131-0
00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:48.317
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I don't wanna have to work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/179-0
00:06:50.237 --> 00:06:54.496
<v Ricky Horton>It'll be interesting, yeah,
but depends on what their expectations</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/179-1
00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:57.485
<v Ricky Horton>are.
Hopefully they're reasonable expectations</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/179-2
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Ricky Horton>on ones that are outside of the yeah,
the available of what we can do. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/179-3
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.276
<v Ricky Horton>but but I manage it's probably something
similar to what I've been doing and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/179-4
00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:08.357
<v Ricky Horton>requisitions for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/201-0
00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:13.997
<v Ricky Horton>For nesting wire,
I'm gonna have us add wire sizes and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/201-1
00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:21.274
<v Ricky Horton>gauges in there and and we'll just keep
those in the same where your metric is is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/201-2
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.517
<v Ricky Horton>the round bar.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/231-0
00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:30.766
<v Ricky Horton>5 minutes. That's where it'll get.
Interesting. You'll have to put it in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/231-1
00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:37.395
<v Ricky Horton>The wire is what like however many feet
that you actually buy in the school or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/231-2
00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:39.157
<v Ricky Horton>whatever it is, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/244-0
00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:46.437
<v Ricky Horton>It's even even like we can buy all the
way up to 30,000 foot schools. Yeah, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/282-0
00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:51.083
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we'll see what see what it comes to when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/282-1
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:55.926
<v Ricky Horton>we get to that. And then yeah,
Alan's gonna kick up shot packages this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/282-2
00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:59.269
<v Ricky Horton>morning.
So he's just gonna listen from in there</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/282-3
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:04.317
<v Ricky Horton>until until we get back in here and then
looks like for our agenda today.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/289-0
00:08:04.957 --> 00:08:10.317
<v Ricky Horton>This integration found everything
blasting and then electrical.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/292-0
00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:14.357
<v Ricky Horton>And then I think that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/334-0
00:08:15.637 --> 00:08:20.269
<v Ricky Horton>There's some white topics that that we
can burn through really quick.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/334-1
00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:24.901
<v Ricky Horton>So we can take a look at the production
and we'll look at our routes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/334-2
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.078
<v Ricky Horton>see if there's any adjustment they should
make,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/334-3
00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:33.637
<v Ricky Horton>make sure that they have the rest of the
route set up, the coding's added and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/338-0
00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:38.197
<v Ricky Horton>I think we can still drop the road back
till you run.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/374-0
00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:44.123
<v Ricky Horton>I don't, I don't feel, I mean,
you tell me what you think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/374-1
00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:47.512
<v Ricky Horton>I don't feel good at all about the
estimating time,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/374-2
00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:52.597
<v Ricky Horton>estimating labor and maybe the total
labor is coming out right. I don't know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/374-3
00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:56.117
<v Ricky Horton>but it seems like that's what is being
used, but the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/397-0
00:08:56.197 --> 00:09:04.323
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if that's maybe that's
something we we could always give back to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/397-1
00:09:04.323 --> 00:09:10.157
<v Ricky Horton>or like, OK, yeah,
we need something else to do that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/440-0
00:09:11.077 --> 00:09:16.364
<v Ricky Horton>There is focus. I'm here for it. Honestly,
I do know that they're going to keep</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/440-1
00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:19.272
<v Ricky Horton>pushing for us to have a higher
percentage,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/440-2
00:09:19.272 --> 00:09:24.626
<v Ricky Horton>even though everything's been adjusted
for 75%. We've never really tweaked that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/440-3
00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:29.517
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to change the settings,
but on the default estimates started.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/450-0
00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:35.849
<v Ricky Horton>98% and then the estimator can adjust
down or up. Yeah, and then uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/450-1
00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:38.997
<v Ricky Horton>kind of tweak our numbers so that they're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/457-0
00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:44.597
<v Ricky Horton>That we can, we can ask what people feel,
but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/461-0
00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:49.237
<v Ricky Horton>Are we going in the schedule at all?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/489-0
00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:55.176
<v Ricky Horton>Mark didn't want us to touch screen until
he could be in here. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/489-1
00:09:55.176 --> 00:10:01.174
<v Ricky Horton>it's the last day ended on it. Yeah,
so tomorrow will be in here full and is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/489-2
00:10:01.174 --> 00:10:03.277
<v Ricky Horton>there anyone that at least.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/526-0
00:10:04.597 --> 00:10:08.941
<v Ricky Horton>I feel like I've got a comfortable grasp
on everything. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/526-1
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.553
<v Ricky Horton>not much benefit on my side,
but for him and doing future production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/526-2
00:10:13.553 --> 00:10:17.496
<v Ricky Horton>planning. Mm-hmm.
I know he's gonna wanna in there and try</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/526-3
00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:20.237
<v Ricky Horton>to forecast some things. OK, so that was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/560-0
00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:24.922
<v Ricky Horton>And I haven't really touched any of the
future forecasting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/560-1
00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:31.016
<v Ricky Horton>So that'll be definitely a little bit of
a refresher for me just reading what they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/560-2
00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:37.037
<v Ricky Horton>have and I released them somewhere now.
So but you're using the project schedule.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/592-0
00:10:37.317 --> 00:10:40.391
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
Are you talking about using it in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/592-1
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:44.233
<v Ricky Horton>production plan? Yeah,
the production planner and the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/592-2
00:10:44.233 --> 00:10:50.101
<v Ricky Horton>So I've used the work packages and added
work packages into our production planner.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/592-3
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, done that. We haven't really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/615-0
00:10:52.917 --> 00:10:57.736
<v Ricky Horton>Full scale,
not really like using the production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/615-1
00:10:57.736 --> 00:11:04.325
<v Ricky Horton>binder. Yeah, essentially.
So steps to using the production binder</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/615-2
00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:08.357
<v Ricky Horton>in its most efficient way so that we can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/664-0
00:11:08.757 --> 00:11:12.509
<v Ricky Horton>Between me and Alan,
if he's gonna keep releasing the packages</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/664-1
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:17.511
<v Ricky Horton>and he is the shop project engineer, yeah,
I should at least be scheduling them out</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/664-2
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:21.740
<v Ricky Horton>so that we have some idea of what we have
to release work. Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/664-3
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.326
<v Ricky Horton>I know we'll keep our own Microsoft
project schedule on the side and need to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/664-4
00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:27.517
<v Ricky Horton>forecast everything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/696-0
00:11:27.757 --> 00:11:34.019
<v Ricky Horton>Multiple different platforms,
but I know that our channel goal is to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/696-1
00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:38.194
<v Ricky Horton>there. So,
so if we can get it there and we can</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/696-2
00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:42.717
<v Ricky Horton>justify that, it's just insufficient. Yep,
Yep, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/705-0
00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:51.037
<v Ricky Horton>But so just in kind of like Nathan,
thank you for that in the spirit business.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/728-0
00:11:54.557 --> 00:12:05.302
<v Ricky Horton>Said it might be 80 degrees today.
Almost 15 degrees above normal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/728-1
00:12:05.302 --> 00:12:11.397
<v Ricky Horton>Now I'm sweating. Gotta go to Lincoln.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/733-0
00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:16.317
<v Ricky Horton>I have a gym bag in my car and then I'm
switching a new T-shirt.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/770-0
00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:23.662
<v Ricky Horton>There's like the story going on, you know,
by 2050, Phoenix would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/770-1
00:12:23.662 --> 00:12:28.455
<v Ricky Horton>It could be so hot, right?
I don't want that temperature.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/770-2
00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:32.670
<v Ricky Horton>It's the hottest. I mean, I remember 123,
I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/770-3
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.637
<v Ricky Horton>I remember it was once said a couple
years ago.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/773-0
00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:39.117
<v Ricky Horton>And that's revenue down here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/789-0
00:12:40.357 --> 00:12:46.893
<v Ricky Horton>So I have summers on record now as being
the one that is great once in downtown</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/789-1
00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:51.877
<v Ricky Horton>Phoenix. It was proven.
I've been there for eight years, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/811-0
00:12:52.837 --> 00:13:06.552
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. In summary it's hard,
especially with our iPads and stuff,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/811-1
00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.677
<v Ricky Horton>like crazy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/844-0
00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:14.658
<v Ricky Horton>When do the guys paint?
I mean the paint just flash that. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/844-1
00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:18.551
<v Ricky Horton>it depends.
We probably have to keep it in ice</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/844-2
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:25.426
<v Ricky Horton>buckets when they try and paint and shade.
They use that internal area quite a bit</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/844-3
00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:28.077
<v Ricky Horton>and then once things dry out to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/866-0
00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Ricky Horton>And then they move things out and then a
lot double handling,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/866-1
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.133
<v Ricky Horton>trying to start slow down so that they
can,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/866-2
00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:39.557
<v Ricky Horton>they can get all their stuff down the
universe as much as possible.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/877-0
00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:55.907
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
my goal is to live in Durango in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/877-1
00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:56.717
<v Ricky Horton>summers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/890-0
00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:18.037
<v Ricky Horton>It needs to be honorable by the time my
house is paid out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/907-0
00:14:19.557 --> 00:14:23.998
<v Ricky Horton>I think I have to do something eventually
about water. Yeah, oh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/907-1
00:14:23.998 --> 00:14:27.757
<v Ricky Horton>that was already making me regret having
to use water.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/922-0
00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:34.556
<v Ricky Horton>That was, uh,
this has been my favorite part of being a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/922-1
00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:38.759
<v Ricky Horton>new homeowner.
They charge me more for water treatment</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/922-2
00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:40.517
<v Ricky Horton>than we have for water.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/926-0
00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:49.077
<v Ricky Horton>But that's a joy to living out in the
sticks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/931-0
00:14:50.597 --> 00:14:52.557
<v Ricky Horton>I can help me on the Internet too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/957-0
00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:58.529
<v Ricky Horton>Where you live? Oh, OK,
so who else take me to get here?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/957-1
00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:03.662
<v Ricky Horton>Depends on what time.
This one only took me about 40 minutes to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/957-2
00:15:03.662 --> 00:15:09.037
<v Ricky Horton>get in because there wasn't anybody the
crickets on the road, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/988-0
00:15:09.397 --> 00:15:12.497
<v Ricky Horton>He said it's about 15 minutes in the
morning,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/988-1
00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:15.462
<v Ricky Horton>an hour to an hour and 10 minutes at
night.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/988-2
00:15:15.462 --> 00:15:20.719
<v Ricky Horton>Left at 6:00 last night to be about an
hour and 5 minutes. So about 30 miles,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/988-3
00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:25.437
<v Ricky Horton>but it's all about cross streets the
whole way. Yeah, I looked up to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1009-0
00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:29.775
<v Ricky Horton>Apartments out there,
it's definitely a little cheaper,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1009-1
00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:33.184
<v Ricky Horton>but yeah,
I just bought a new build out there and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1009-2
00:15:33.184 --> 00:15:37.957
<v Ricky Horton>the the builder was buying down rates,
so I got 3.7% of my house, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1012-0
00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:41.877
<v Ricky Horton>So couldn't pass that on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1013-0
00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:49.237
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1020-0
00:15:52.877 --> 00:15:57.077
<v Ricky Horton>So just like in my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1021-0
00:15:57.317 --> 00:15:57.797
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1052-0
00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:05.889
<v Ricky Horton>Look at that latest release version 2035
by SP2. I just noticed that. No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1052-1
00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:13.837
<v Ricky Horton>I wasn't that early this morning when I
was logged in and said I'm assuming that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1071-0
00:16:14.397 --> 00:16:21.168
<v Ricky Horton>That patch is all edited,
but so that's what. Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1071-1
00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:28.757
<v Ricky Horton>Keith sent out an e-mail this morning and
it is SP1 patch dates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1073-0
00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:29.877
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1086-0
00:16:32.437 --> 00:16:40.277
<v Ricky Horton>But I haven't had any issues that may
have been running, um, inspection test.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1093-0
00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:54.517
<v Ricky Horton>I'm looking forward. Bam. Beautiful. Yeah.
And to that, we will see looking forward.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1128-0
00:16:59.557 --> 00:17:03.077
<v Ricky Horton>All right. Well,
what's what's kind of weird about all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1128-1
00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:06.917
<v Ricky Horton>that is if at a different shop every week,
right. So, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1128-2
00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:12.165
<v Ricky Horton>what's so weird is I'm in one place that
you run just very like last week we were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1128-3
00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:17.477
<v Ricky Horton>running the toy group on the highest of
York. And then we'll go to the next place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1130-0
00:17:18.317 --> 00:17:18.837
<v Ricky Horton>So weird.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1168-0
00:17:22.797 --> 00:17:27.766
<v Ricky Horton>We've seen that worse luck when it comes
to hygiene stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1168-1
00:17:27.766 --> 00:17:33.325
<v Ricky Horton>It is the uphill battle every time,
but that's right. Eventually,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1168-2
00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:40.064
<v Ricky Horton>it sounds like they're going to be doing
a whole new service stacks and they're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1168-3
00:17:40.064 --> 00:17:41.917
<v Ricky Horton>paying the company to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1206-0
00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:48.027
<v Ricky Horton>Completely redo our servers. Oh wow.
And this Keith is our original IT guy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1206-1
00:17:48.027 --> 00:17:52.368
<v Ricky Horton>He built everything that's gone on around
here. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1206-2
00:17:52.368 --> 00:17:58.237
<v Ricky Horton>and that whole service stack himself.
And then now he's like, all right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1240-0
00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:02.821
<v Ricky Horton>Y'all this. Yeah.
We're long grown now and we have so many</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1240-1
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:06.967
<v Ricky Horton>different companies that you're trying to
tie together. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1240-2
00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:11.513
<v Ricky Horton>You need to pay somebody who knows how to
tie these together. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1240-3
00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:12.717
<v Ricky Horton>So is it gonna be?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1273-0
00:18:13.877 --> 00:18:19.134
<v Ricky Horton>On Premise server, OK, yeah,
we'll have the the server on on premise.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1273-1
00:18:19.134 --> 00:18:24.691
<v Ricky Horton>It'll be the same area in the main office
where the current one is. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1273-2
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:28.597
<v Ricky Horton>it'll just be a whole lot more beefy or
the server.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1299-0
00:18:29.957 --> 00:18:34.443
<v Ricky Horton>Something that wasn't Frankenstein
together over five years,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1299-1
00:18:34.443 --> 00:18:39.811
<v Ricky Horton>then that's gonna be looking at it for
sure or something like, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1299-2
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:44.812
<v Ricky Horton>off site that those can be fun to dial in
and get this work itself.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1299-3
00:18:44.812 --> 00:18:48.637
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's always slow when we first get
that route.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1301-0
00:18:48.637 --> 00:18:50.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1302-0
00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:51.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1327-0
00:18:54.117 --> 00:18:59.292
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so Vista integration discussion actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1327-1
00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:08.377
<v Ricky Horton>is here to do this quick to and then well
we talked about this the a couple of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1327-2
00:19:08.377 --> 00:19:09.757
<v Ricky Horton>times is it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1336-0
00:19:10.077 --> 00:19:14.362
<v Ricky Horton>Orth integrating,
I guess is the right question. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1336-1
00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.077
<v Ricky Horton>that's the main thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1347-0
00:19:18.317 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Ricky Horton>Really.
The the hardware is really gonna listen</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1347-1
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.477
<v Ricky Horton>to what I say. Awesome. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1349-0
00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:28.517
<v Ricky Horton>So that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1356-0
00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:34.357
<v Ricky Horton>I guess this will do this.
I mean to like create a meeting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1357-0
00:19:40.717 --> 00:19:41.157
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1402-0
00:19:44.077 --> 00:19:48.052
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
I imagine there's a lot of companies that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1402-1
00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:53.936
<v Ricky Horton>just run a check to and that's it.
They run the whole business off of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1402-2
00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:57.911
<v Ricky Horton>That's, yeah,
they'll have different software for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1402-3
00:19:57.911 --> 00:20:03.159
<v Ricky Horton>accounting, obviously,
because this isn't an accounting software,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1402-4
00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:03.477
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1410-0
00:20:03.997 --> 00:20:10.597
<v Ricky Horton>They don't feed it, but yeah,
this is my software feed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1438-0
00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:31.104
<v Ricky Horton>Part of it last time,
but I'm trying to question the reporting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1438-1
00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:36.483
<v Ricky Horton>They wouldn't want to give me some.
All right, so yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1438-2
00:20:36.483 --> 00:20:39.557
<v Ricky Horton>I guess the main thing would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1441-0
00:20:40.557 --> 00:20:42.557
<v Ricky Horton>Which I can take notes here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1446-0
00:20:44.997 --> 00:20:47.197
<v Ricky Horton>This is integration wise.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1474-0
00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Ricky Horton>And I know we talked about it last time
and we read quite vividly whatever</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1474-1
00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:02.192
<v Ricky Horton>management wanted was not what we can do
regardless of the version problem.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1474-2
00:21:02.192 --> 00:21:06.717
<v Ricky Horton>So they essentially wanted all of our
labor codes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1514-0
00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:12.971
<v Ricky Horton>To be from estimate pushed into
production and then have our labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1514-1
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:19.566
<v Ricky Horton>exported in the time tracking way that we
do in those time tracking reports with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1514-2
00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:23.637
<v Ricky Horton>the labor codes associated pushed back
into this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1544-0
00:21:23.837 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
because you're basically not doing the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1544-1
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.845
<v Ricky Horton>diamond in here anyways, so well,
and we do all of our time tracking in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1544-2
00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:39.157
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla, everything that we export to Vista,
we.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1573-0
00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:46.054
<v Ricky Horton>Export out of here in an Excel sheet that
has each employee's information,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1573-1
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:50.815
<v Ricky Horton>employee number,
and then whenever we set up a project,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1573-2
00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:55.237
<v Ricky Horton>each sequence and block is actually your
face code.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1601-0
00:21:56.597 --> 00:22:03.248
<v Ricky Horton>So 39, one thousand.
So we end up filtering our tabs down and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1601-1
00:22:03.248 --> 00:22:10.757
<v Ricky Horton>kind of setting it out and remapping the
the sheet so that it can be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1635-0
00:22:10.957 --> 00:22:14.806
<v Ricky Horton>But into Vista with this OK and Vista
pulls the 39,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1635-1
00:22:14.806 --> 00:22:20.581
<v Ricky Horton>000 in the employee number and the hours
associated and imports that I guess.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1635-2
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:26.134
<v Ricky Horton>So actually and then you're having to do
that on your project or it's just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1635-3
00:22:26.134 --> 00:22:27.837
<v Ricky Horton>automatic, it's set up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1673-0
00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:35.267
<v Ricky Horton>We do that for every project and the
whole weekly supports and it's a week and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1673-1
00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:39.733
<v Ricky Horton>adjust the Excel sheet and snip that took
them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1673-2
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:44.757
<v Ricky Horton>So so this that you look at it in best
case scenario.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1700-0
00:22:46.037 --> 00:22:52.521
<v Ricky Horton>It's a big buy. Yeah,
essentially like all of our favorable.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1700-1
00:22:52.521 --> 00:22:58.899
<v Ricky Horton>We're we have that when we so
everything's slightly behind.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1700-2
00:22:58.899 --> 00:23:01.557
<v Ricky Horton>So we have two different.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1740-0
00:23:01.757 --> 00:23:05.783
<v Ricky Horton>Two different contracting systems.
We have the face recognition system</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1740-1
00:23:05.783 --> 00:23:08.505
<v Ricky Horton>that's completely external entity of all
of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1740-2
00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:12.929
<v Ricky Horton>Each employee clocks in with their face
recognition so they're understandable</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1740-3
00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:16.898
<v Ricky Horton>when they come in and then when they're
working on projects with you,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1740-4
00:23:16.898 --> 00:23:18.997
<v Ricky Horton>they're also duplicating those hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1762-0
00:23:20.837 --> 00:23:25.934
<v Ricky Horton>Into Tekla so that this one will go to
our project schedule.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1762-1
00:23:25.934 --> 00:23:30.948
<v Ricky Horton>You can see that's where the hours come
back in here. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1762-2
00:23:30.948 --> 00:23:33.957
<v Ricky Horton>hours come back against the project.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1787-0
00:23:34.477 --> 00:23:40.263
<v Ricky Horton>And you know percent complete versus
hours used as we're going along.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1787-1
00:23:40.263 --> 00:23:46.381
<v Ricky Horton>This is what we reviewed in our Thursday
meetings updating the engine and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1787-2
00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:49.357
<v Ricky Horton>production. So we'll see if we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1805-0
00:23:49.997 --> 00:24:00.412
<v Ricky Horton>You know about production stations or
trying to talk about production stations</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1805-1
00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:02.917
<v Ricky Horton>or the contracting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1812-0
00:24:05.197 --> 00:24:09.917
<v Ricky Horton>Need to start running tracking one. OK,
cool. Is there a daily labor report?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1813-0
00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:10.917
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1816-0
00:24:15.117 --> 00:24:17.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yes and no.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1850-0
00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:24.317
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if there's a specific report
that you can pull across all projects</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1850-1
00:24:24.317 --> 00:24:29.544
<v Ricky Horton>because it's project management side and
project management side doesn't have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1850-2
00:24:29.544 --> 00:24:34.637
<v Ricky Horton>reports that pull across every single
project management job, but each day.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1885-0
00:24:34.637 --> 00:24:42.111
<v Ricky Horton>I get an e-mail from the shop lead that
is basically a recap from the previous</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1885-1
00:24:42.111 --> 00:24:49.397
<v Ricky Horton>day of hours used. What increased?
What increased if we're a negative trend?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1919-0
00:24:51.437 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Ricky Horton>With hours versus percent completes and
so on and so forth.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1919-1
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:02.937
<v Ricky Horton>So I get this report daily me and Mark
get it so that we can start getting ahead</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1919-2
00:25:02.937 --> 00:25:06.933
<v Ricky Horton>of it.
And then this is this is our weekly sheet</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1919-3
00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:08.157
<v Ricky Horton>that we review.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1959-0
00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:13.495
<v Ricky Horton>And go around Fridays,
which is essentially the snapshots of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1959-1
00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:19.229
<v Ricky Horton>production schedules that are in each
project sequence and associated just to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1959-2
00:25:19.229 --> 00:25:24.155
<v Ricky Horton>review what's been used,
where where our percentages are at. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1959-3
00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:27.757
<v Ricky Horton>I get that when you're evaluating
projects, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1991-0
00:25:28.077 --> 00:25:33.933
<v Ricky Horton>On the accounting side, you've always,
I've always used to being able to look at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1991-1
00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:37.693
<v Ricky Horton>daily labor period. Forget which job.
Yeah, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/1991-2
00:25:37.693 --> 00:25:43.477
<v Ricky Horton>I can go into the time track in module 35
or during over hours and we can fold.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2009-0
00:25:43.997 --> 00:25:48.403
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I wasn't interviewed each day,
I guess. So being that probably is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2009-1
00:25:48.403 --> 00:25:52.749
<v Ricky Horton>I know what you're talking about.
Do you track productive labour versus</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2009-2
00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:53.957
<v Ricky Horton>unproductive labour?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2043-0
00:25:56.877 --> 00:26:01.406
<v Ricky Horton>With direct versus indirect,
I guess is a better way to say it like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2043-1
00:26:01.406 --> 00:26:04.537
<v Ricky Horton>yes,
we do have an indirect project to be here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2043-2
00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:09.799
<v Ricky Horton>where guys can apply their times that are
on indirect which would be our 1200.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2043-3
00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:13.197
<v Ricky Horton>This is all anything entered towards this
project.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2066-0
00:26:13.237 --> 00:26:20.069
<v Ricky Horton>Project it was the indirect costs,
but most of the time the solution saw the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2066-1
00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:25.836
<v Ricky Horton>rest if we were using this.
So most of the time all of our times</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2066-2
00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:27.877
<v Ricky Horton>allocated the projects.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2068-0
00:26:28.277 --> 00:26:29.997
<v Ricky Horton>So on you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2077-0
00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:41.477
<v Ricky Horton>Time tracking summary I can pull.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2078-0
00:26:43.677 --> 00:26:43.917
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2080-0
00:26:45.957 --> 00:26:47.357
<v Ricky Horton>Yesterday it stayed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2087-0
00:26:52.597 --> 00:26:55.197
<v Ricky Horton>And this will give me a summary of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2118-0
00:26:57.397 --> 00:27:03.405
<v Ricky Horton>All the labor that was entered yesterday.
So there's a couple of guys.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2118-1
00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Ricky Horton>I think this one needs to be adjusted.
There's no way in hell somebody yesterday</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2118-2
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.037
<v Ricky Horton>did 37.25 dollars on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2150-0
00:27:13.677 --> 00:27:18.401
<v Ricky Horton>Project 21 day.
So this would be where Ramon or TJ goes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2150-1
00:27:18.401 --> 00:27:23.885
<v Ricky Horton>in and goes, excuse me,
what employee versus this and why in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2150-2
00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:28.357
<v Ricky Horton>world is this displaying? Productive.
Good. So yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2183-0
00:27:28.997 --> 00:27:32.969
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, this is,
this is probably the best,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2183-1
00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:38.323
<v Ricky Horton>best area for this.
So and then and what you're telling me is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2183-2
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:45.491
<v Ricky Horton>each line item is a person or it's really
the summation of multiple people in that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2183-3
00:27:45.491 --> 00:27:45.837
<v Ricky Horton>job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2205-0
00:27:46.917 --> 00:27:54.145
<v Ricky Horton>This is our entire shots yesterday, right?
So, so yesterday somebody,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2205-1
00:27:54.145 --> 00:27:57.037
<v Ricky Horton>some group of people wanted.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2212-0
00:27:58.597 --> 00:28:03.197
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
charge 37 hours to indirect job 1200 year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2237-0
00:28:04.197 --> 00:28:06.689
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
and we end up going to here and they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2237-1
00:28:06.689 --> 00:28:09.596
<v Ricky Horton>worked in the shipping receiving
department. Uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2237-2
00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:12.681
<v Ricky Horton>this does not you should be receiving.
So why they?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2237-3
00:28:12.681 --> 00:28:14.877
<v Ricky Horton>Why are they wanting to the handling?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2289-0
00:28:17.037 --> 00:28:21.723
<v Ricky Horton>Because shipping and receiving does not
handle our material for us.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2289-1
00:28:21.723 --> 00:28:26.341
<v Ricky Horton>They often trust. That's it.
If it requires to be moved around the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2289-2
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:31.924
<v Ricky Horton>shop or pulled out of the shop or station
in the front because it's completed or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2289-3
00:28:31.924 --> 00:28:36.197
<v Ricky Horton>needs to go from the station to Weld
station, all of that is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2293-0
00:28:37.037 --> 00:28:41.517
<v Ricky Horton>Handling by a shot of police. Yeah,
so we essentially.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2297-0
00:28:42.797 --> 00:28:46.117
<v Ricky Horton>The majority of our projects have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2331-0
00:28:47.357 --> 00:28:54.689
<v Ricky Horton>Well handling the cuts on burn each of
these burn cuts on fit up and well all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2331-1
00:28:54.689 --> 00:29:00.235
<v Ricky Horton>types of station.
So those give percent complete mark offs</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2331-2
00:29:00.235 --> 00:29:02.397
<v Ricky Horton>as they go through the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2361-0
00:29:02.557 --> 00:29:10.310
<v Ricky Horton>Mark up to piece tracking and uh and fit
up some types of inspections that's uh is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2361-1
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:16.195
<v Ricky Horton>tied to our cut list.
Bird is tied to the cut list as well and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2361-2
00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:17.877
<v Ricky Horton>then well it is a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2364-0
00:29:17.877 --> 00:29:19.757
<v Ricky Horton>Well, inspection shot, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2366-0
00:29:22.117 --> 00:29:24.237
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's what we got there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2367-0
00:29:28.437 --> 00:29:28.557
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2368-0
00:29:30.757 --> 00:29:32.317
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2397-0
00:29:34.717 --> 00:29:38.114
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that exports out of using that payroll as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2397-1
00:29:38.114 --> 00:29:43.634
<v Ricky Horton>well. Yeah, cool. So working. Yeah.
What do you like? What do you don't like?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2397-2
00:29:43.634 --> 00:29:48.658
<v Ricky Horton>I guess the biggest thing that they
they're they're trying to automate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2397-3
00:29:48.658 --> 00:29:49.437
<v Ricky Horton>everything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2436-0
00:29:50.277 --> 00:29:58.216
<v Ricky Horton>I think that that was their intentional
goal with the Vista integration is to not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2436-1
00:29:58.216 --> 00:30:04.509
<v Ricky Horton>have us pulling Excel sheets,
modifying them so that they can be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2436-2
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:09.157
<v Ricky Horton>affordable and and then having that extra
step.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2473-0
00:30:10.557 --> 00:30:14.826
<v Ricky Horton>But I'm pretty sure from what the Vista
integration is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2473-1
00:30:14.826 --> 00:30:20.924
<v Ricky Horton>is the invoice out from a purchase orders
standpoint all on the purchasing side</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2473-2
00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:24.049
<v Ricky Horton>there.
So and that I mean for purchasing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2473-3
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:25.117
<v Ricky Horton>stealing here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2505-0
00:30:25.877 --> 00:30:31.594
<v Ricky Horton>And that's pretty much the extent of it
with the exception of a few sub</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2505-1
00:30:31.594 --> 00:30:35.168
<v Ricky Horton>fabrication EOS that I put together.
And so,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2505-2
00:30:35.168 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Ricky Horton>so with that I I don't really see because
I'm sure with the Vista with purchasing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2505-3
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.077
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2538-0
00:30:42.597 --> 00:30:45.708
<v Ricky Horton>Module.
There's money associated with that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2538-1
00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:49.879
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not going to eliminate us time
to do double work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2538-2
00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:55.182
<v Ricky Horton>So we're gonna spend money instantly,
the double work. So it just doesn't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2538-3
00:30:55.182 --> 00:30:58.717
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't seem like a good investment.
Yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2546-0
00:30:59.437 --> 00:31:04.877
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's I I'll say this.
I don't see them ever.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2572-0
00:31:06.877 --> 00:31:18.082
<v Ricky Horton>Pulling the contracting and automatic and
the only reason I say is because so many</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2572-1
00:31:18.082 --> 00:31:21.997
<v Ricky Horton>do not be the contracting so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2577-0
00:31:22.877 --> 00:31:26.957
<v Ricky Horton>Their thought was probably my last.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2606-0
00:31:28.197 --> 00:31:34.478
<v Ricky Horton>Um, all the times that are spent. So yeah,
I wouldn't count.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2606-1
00:31:34.478 --> 00:31:42.613
<v Ricky Horton>So why do people not try to care time?
The interface is a little clunky on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2606-2
00:31:42.613 --> 00:31:43.437
<v Ricky Horton>for the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2647-0
00:31:43.797 --> 00:31:49.544
<v Ricky Horton>The contract and so things and a lot of
people are using a a payroll software to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2647-1
00:31:49.544 --> 00:31:54.298
<v Ricky Horton>their their contract in order to do that
rather than any. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2647-2
00:31:54.298 --> 00:31:59.406
<v Ricky Horton>which definitely makes sense because I
would definitely agree with that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2647-3
00:31:59.406 --> 00:32:01.677
<v Ricky Horton>statement. I mean if we go into.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2684-0
00:32:01.877 --> 00:32:08.356
<v Ricky Horton>For time tracking and you do the time
tracking input like if we go in here and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2684-1
00:32:08.356 --> 00:32:13.441
<v Ricky Horton>it's easier to see on the EPM go,
but like the notes section,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2684-2
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:19.428
<v Ricky Horton>there's so many random notes in there and
you can't hardly believe them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2684-3
00:32:19.428 --> 00:32:21.397
<v Ricky Horton>It just stayed in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2719-0
00:32:21.637 --> 00:32:27.556
<v Ricky Horton>And it's it's and usually it's one letter,
enter back into it, one letter,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2719-1
00:32:27.556 --> 00:32:32.292
<v Ricky Horton>enter back into it, one letter,
enter back into one letter.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2719-2
00:32:32.292 --> 00:32:36.397
<v Ricky Horton>So it takes you 5 to 10 minutes to put an
entry in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2743-0
00:32:36.837 --> 00:32:42.658
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of the guys will track it on the
sheet, give it to her, Nolan,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2743-1
00:32:42.658 --> 00:32:47.510
<v Ricky Horton>they'll enter it in about 5 minutes here
and it's done. So,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2743-2
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.957
<v Ricky Horton>so many people want really good time
tracking in here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2776-0
00:32:52.357 --> 00:32:56.699
<v Ricky Horton>And this this is functional,
so it's not there. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2776-1
00:32:56.699 --> 00:33:02.568
<v Ricky Horton>and we're definitely using it,
but I've actually considered like like my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2776-2
00:33:02.568 --> 00:33:08.197
<v Ricky Horton>my son has a master's in data science and
so I'm actually considered.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2805-0
00:33:08.277 --> 00:33:14.523
<v Ricky Horton>Paying him to do a better interface with
with some more controls and stuff around.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2805-1
00:33:14.523 --> 00:33:20.168
<v Ricky Horton>So if I were able to get there,
I'd experiment you since you're new to it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2805-2
00:33:20.168 --> 00:33:23.254
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that would be that would be pretty</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2805-3
00:33:23.254 --> 00:33:24.157
<v Ricky Horton>awesome, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2840-0
00:33:24.597 --> 00:33:32.136
<v Ricky Horton>So what system of time captured in
currently times captured in here tracking</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2840-1
00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:39.969
<v Ricky Horton>is production exported out and and then
verified against our facial recognition</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2840-2
00:33:39.969 --> 00:33:44.277
<v Ricky Horton>system that we have in the shop we
compare.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2880-0
00:33:44.437 --> 00:33:49.735
<v Ricky Horton>The numbers to the numbers to make sure
that they all match and then and then we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2880-1
00:33:49.735 --> 00:33:53.987
<v Ricky Horton>submitted the actual Excel sheet from
this from tech blog to EW.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2880-2
00:33:53.987 --> 00:33:59.154
<v Ricky Horton>So our facial recognition was installed
when we used to have QuickBooks and it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2880-3
00:33:59.154 --> 00:34:00.397
<v Ricky Horton>was using the same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2928-0
00:34:00.837 --> 00:34:05.879
<v Ricky Horton>We would just clock in with their face
and clock out with their face and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2928-1
00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:09.564
<v Ricky Horton>we'll just send it.
But that way you give us the project</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2928-2
00:34:09.564 --> 00:34:14.736
<v Ricky Horton>breaking up and what they're working on.
This gives us the ability to know what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2928-3
00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:18.873
<v Ricky Horton>project they're working on,
detailed environment with the final</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2928-4
00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:20.037
<v Ricky Horton>projects that day.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2970-0
00:34:20.437 --> 00:34:24.187
<v Ricky Horton>And the time is actually divided up
between 5:00 versus.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2970-1
00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:28.398
<v Ricky Horton>That's why you use both.
I mean there's one to figure out which</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2970-2
00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:33.333
<v Ricky Horton>projects they worked on during the day
and the other one just to try. Yep,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2970-3
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.557
<v Ricky Horton>pretty much.
One's the in and out and one's the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2990-0
00:34:36.837 --> 00:34:41.704
<v Ricky Horton>Because the guy puts in his face, phone,
whatever you want to do it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/2990-1
00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:44.597
<v Ricky Horton>Job X workstate, you know, workstation Y.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3015-0
00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:49.352
<v Ricky Horton>And he may work five jobs a day,
but it's all system.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3015-1
00:34:49.352 --> 00:34:52.348
<v Ricky Horton>It seems probably that it's very, well,
this one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3015-2
00:34:52.348 --> 00:34:55.944
<v Ricky Horton>and this one actually do it all in one,
like he wanted the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3015-3
00:34:55.944 --> 00:35:00.618
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to correct me if I'm wrong,
but the facial thing that that was the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3015-4
00:35:00.618 --> 00:35:01.277
<v Ricky Horton>thing from.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3044-0
00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:05.497
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, right.
Make sure some people were actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3044-1
00:35:05.497 --> 00:35:09.928
<v Ricky Horton>working. Yeah,
the same people were actually working.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3044-2
00:35:09.928 --> 00:35:14.277
<v Ricky Horton>It does auto-temp checks and but even
then it was a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3086-0
00:35:15.237 --> 00:35:20.529
<v Ricky Horton>Making sure you're coming in at the right
time and then documenting with somebody's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3086-1
00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:25.569
<v Ricky Horton>over 5 minutes late kind of thing cause
in here you can go in there and say you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3086-2
00:35:25.569 --> 00:35:30.357
<v Ricky Horton>started at 4:00 in the morning and if you
know he was there to verify that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3139-0
00:35:30.357 --> 00:35:35.493
<v Ricky Horton>But if you have to put your face in front
of the monitor and it takes a picture of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3139-1
00:35:35.493 --> 00:35:39.206
<v Ricky Horton>you and you get in,
then then you're held more accountable.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3139-2
00:35:39.206 --> 00:35:42.239
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
it goes together with the way it's like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3139-3
00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:47.314
<v Ricky Horton>where they do what it's like and they're
only talking to the phone. Yeah, so, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3139-4
00:35:47.314 --> 00:35:50.037
<v Ricky Horton>And that's the other side of us using
this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3173-0
00:35:50.237 --> 00:35:54.354
<v Ricky Horton>And that in the morning they walk by,
catches their pace,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3173-1
00:35:54.354 --> 00:35:59.252
<v Ricky Horton>they can go off to the floor,
start working and then they have their</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3173-2
00:35:59.252 --> 00:36:05.073
<v Ricky Horton>iPads on their cell phones and they can
instantly right there update on this next</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3173-3
00:36:05.073 --> 00:36:08.197
<v Ricky Horton>project. I'm talking on this one,
this one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3200-0
00:36:08.637 --> 00:36:15.025
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll tell you what,
I would want to try to automate for the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3200-1
00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Ricky Horton>the reporting. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And that's something I also look into as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3200-2
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.037
<v Ricky Horton>well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3202-0
00:36:23.437 --> 00:36:23.677
<v Ricky Horton>Well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3253-0
00:36:25.557 --> 00:36:28.743
<v Ricky Horton>And setting it up for for just Monday's
each week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3253-1
00:36:28.743 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Ricky Horton>The problem I ran into that would be I'm
getting a call from the shop manager. Hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3253-2
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:39.113
<v Ricky Horton>I am coming to your time for Friday. Yes,
I need you to hold off on it and then I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3253-3
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:42.237
<v Ricky Horton>got a report exported out to five people
on like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3280-0
00:36:43.197 --> 00:36:47.788
<v Ricky Horton>Hold on this. Yeah,
this needs to be addressed for if</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3280-1
00:36:47.788 --> 00:36:53.485
<v Ricky Horton>somebody decided to put 36 in there
instead of three or six. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3280-2
00:36:53.485 --> 00:36:56.717
<v Ricky Horton>so and but I think that that could be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3314-0
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:03.581
<v Ricky Horton>And I say automated reformat it so you
don't have to change it once you crap</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3314-1
00:37:03.581 --> 00:37:07.427
<v Ricky Horton>your format the the spreadsheet or to get
it in. Oh yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3314-2
00:37:07.427 --> 00:37:12.598
<v Ricky Horton>there'd be there'd be a way to get an
album the right format that you need it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3314-3
00:37:12.598 --> 00:37:12.797
<v Ricky Horton>to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3363-0
00:37:13.077 --> 00:37:21.065
<v Ricky Horton>Custom export that would be that would be
definitely the the other beneficial side</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3363-1
00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:28.958
<v Ricky Horton>is not going to pull a bunch of columns
out there not to what we need if you want</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3363-2
00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:31.557
<v Ricky Horton>to look into that I've got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3387-0
00:37:31.637 --> 00:37:36.378
<v Ricky Horton>I'll give you names of some people that
can do that. OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3387-1
00:37:36.378 --> 00:37:41.119
<v Ricky Horton>Doesn't look like first reports kind of
the rules. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3387-2
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:47.357
<v Ricky Horton>How much time does that take you?
Doing the time for us, right? 5 minutes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3415-0
00:37:47.757 --> 00:37:52.927
<v Ricky Horton>Per day on Monday, one day a week,
one day a week. Yeah, that's all. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3415-1
00:37:52.927 --> 00:37:58.441
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's been the biggest thing
is we haven't done too many like custom</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3415-2
00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:01.957
<v Ricky Horton>reports in here because Crystal reports
gonna get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3466-0
00:38:02.997 --> 00:38:06.772
<v Ricky Horton>They can get spending.
You got a lot of different things that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3466-1
00:38:06.772 --> 00:38:09.451
<v Ricky Horton>you want.
Maybe you want to get changed and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3466-2
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:12.922
<v Ricky Horton>adjusted around.
So are you the only one that does it or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3466-3
00:38:12.922 --> 00:38:16.575
<v Ricky Horton>reserve when you're on vacation?
Somebody else does it. No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3466-4
00:38:16.575 --> 00:38:19.437
<v Ricky Horton>there's other people that can do it.
You shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3505-0
00:38:19.837 --> 00:38:25.082
<v Ricky Horton>One of the shop leads remote because the
time tracking emails that he sends out,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3505-1
00:38:25.082 --> 00:38:28.709
<v Ricky Horton>he can do the exports.
Mark can do the exports as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3505-2
00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:33.242
<v Ricky Horton>You can just do the the fab guy or
somebody else does the paint guys.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3505-3
00:38:33.242 --> 00:38:36.157
<v Ricky Horton>Paint guys don't use this system
whatsoever.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3537-0
00:38:36.997 --> 00:38:41.270
<v Ricky Horton>They are.
They've been very anti system for a long</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3537-1
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:48.142
<v Ricky Horton>time and now we are pushing heavily for
them to use it and with Moe being the the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3537-2
00:38:48.142 --> 00:38:53.757
<v Ricky Horton>leader of buildings at this point,
he's very on board with it, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3554-0
00:38:54.117 --> 00:38:57.930
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
we're taking full advantage of having an</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3554-1
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:04.117
<v Ricky Horton>advocate on the side. So they say both.
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3557-0
00:39:04.997 --> 00:39:10.237
<v Ricky Horton>This definitely came a long way, me and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3577-0
00:39:13.197 --> 00:39:17.268
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
So I guess if this was talk through</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3577-1
00:39:17.268 --> 00:39:23.070
<v Ricky Horton>business integration,
what we can do as well integration</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3577-2
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.837
<v Ricky Horton>basically, let me see if we can find.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3584-0
00:39:43.957 --> 00:39:48.517
<v Ricky Horton>So this is what she got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3600-0
00:39:51.877 --> 00:39:59.946
<v Ricky Horton>So I am trying to add a heat member and
obviously attach and be document to it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3600-1
00:39:59.946 --> 00:40:03.317
<v Ricky Horton>like an MTR. Oh also didn't heat.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3637-0
00:40:14.957 --> 00:40:20.540
<v Ricky Horton>All directors understand.
This is something that needs that there</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3637-1
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.377
<v Ricky Horton>you can set that globally.
This is something about how it came over.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3637-2
00:40:26.377 --> 00:40:29.677
<v Ricky Horton>It's like you got to get this globally.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3643-0
00:40:30.037 --> 00:40:34.677
<v Ricky Horton>Finally got it this year,
so you need to set that up locally.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3649-0
00:40:36.277 --> 00:40:38.917
<v Ricky Horton>So we can see the preset matrix.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3670-0
00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:45.038
<v Ricky Horton>You can set that up right there and it
just goes out everybody rather than the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3670-1
00:40:45.038 --> 00:40:48.650
<v Ricky Horton>individual setting.
There's there's no reason it should be an</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3670-2
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.757
<v Ricky Horton>individual setting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3685-0
00:40:55.317 --> 00:41:00.658
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
as long as everybody has a hard drive map</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3685-1
00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:03.277
<v Ricky Horton>map, you know, Yeah, now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3728-0
00:41:05.037 --> 00:41:10.557
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty much everybody should have on our
map that's in temporary.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3728-1
00:41:10.557 --> 00:41:16.997
<v Ricky Horton>Do you not have any customer reports?
Because right now there's no place for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3728-2
00:41:16.997 --> 00:41:23.437
<v Ricky Horton>customer reports. OK, I like the log, Sir.
We may talk about this last time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3736-0
00:41:24.237 --> 00:41:29.757
<v Ricky Horton>Reason I like that is because when you
when you do an import.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3786-0
00:41:31.717 --> 00:41:35.237
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody knows exactly where to go to
see the law.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3786-1
00:41:35.237 --> 00:41:40.383
<v Ricky Horton>So like even project managers were like,
OK, something happened on the job,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3786-2
00:41:40.383 --> 00:41:45.054
<v Ricky Horton>on the import. What was it?
Or was it regissions that I needed to go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3786-3
00:41:45.054 --> 00:41:49.117
<v Ricky Horton>change or they could actually go to the
log and pull it up?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3819-0
00:41:49.397 --> 00:41:54.481
<v Ricky Horton>Without having to get your computer full
on your log apparently. But yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3819-1
00:41:54.481 --> 00:41:59.700
<v Ricky Horton>you said that it added at the bottom,
but then it's everybody used to say by</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3819-2
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.717
<v Ricky Horton>default everybody's going to have the
check box set for default up there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3833-0
00:42:05.077 --> 00:42:09.498
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so now I'm gonna try and see if see if it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3833-1
00:42:09.498 --> 00:42:11.517
<v Ricky Horton>also lets me do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3841-0
00:42:12.757 --> 00:42:14.430
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'm definitely not opposed to putting all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3841-1
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.197
<v Ricky Horton>of that on the server.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3859-0
00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:24.943
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll get the key.
Would anybody else here ever be be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3859-1
00:42:24.943 --> 00:42:29.357
<v Ricky Horton>wanting to buy or customize the report
beside you?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3882-0
00:42:34.557 --> 00:42:40.261
<v Ricky Horton>Because they'll be able to customize it.
They'll just be customizing the the end</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3882-1
00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:44.557
<v Ricky Horton>report and next time you get an update,
they'll override it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3915-0
00:42:46.477 --> 00:42:53.355
<v Ricky Horton>Probably not. Probably. If anything,
I'll get the request and then I'll do it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3915-1
00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:58.405
<v Ricky Horton>So we try to do some modifications for
our shop traveler,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3915-2
00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:04.935
<v Ricky Horton>but that's using fully Indian Go,
moving with paper documentation anyways,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3915-3
00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:05.197
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3929-0
00:43:05.557 --> 00:43:11.357
<v Ricky Horton>Not at this point, yeah,
but if you didn't just set that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3935-0
00:43:12.437 --> 00:43:19.477
<v Ricky Horton>Get a fold roll so we can set that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3937-0
00:43:21.957 --> 00:43:23.437
<v Ricky Horton>That makes it. Yep. Cool.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3976-0
00:43:28.677 --> 00:43:32.912
<v Ricky Horton>I think I've been looking for that for a
long, not a meeting with you,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3976-1
00:43:32.912 --> 00:43:37.506
<v Ricky Horton>but finally last year I called them up
and I'm like, we're having a meeting,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3976-2
00:43:37.506 --> 00:43:42.219
<v Ricky Horton>like I'm sure if I fight this because
everywhere I have been, people are like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3976-3
00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:45.023
<v Ricky Horton>well,
I've looked at the journal and I'm going</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/3976-4
00:43:45.023 --> 00:43:46.157
<v Ricky Horton>to see the journal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4002-0
00:43:46.637 --> 00:43:50.870
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I've had a few times that I've had</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4002-1
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:58.202
<v Ricky Horton>whenever a new union start. Yeah,
they reach out and send me something</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4002-2
00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:01.197
<v Ricky Horton>who's not right here. Mm-hmm.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4015-0
00:44:01.637 --> 00:44:04.649
<v Ricky Horton>Just check over here,
send him a screenshot of this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4015-1
00:44:04.649 --> 00:44:07.037
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure it's that you got it next still.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4032-0
00:44:08.797 --> 00:44:12.724
<v Ricky Horton>No, it's definitely useful. Yeah,
but that's that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4032-1
00:44:12.724 --> 00:44:17.499
<v Ricky Horton>I'll make the adjustments so that
everything's on the server,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4032-2
00:44:17.499 --> 00:44:22.197
<v Ricky Horton>'cause that would be that would be like
better. So yeah, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4052-0
00:44:26.117 --> 00:44:35.741
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I was looking for base code.
So this is their new massive governing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4052-1
00:44:35.741 --> 00:44:41.877
<v Ricky Horton>base code guide.
What's most important we have is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4057-0
00:44:47.877 --> 00:44:48.597
<v Ricky Horton>39 all the way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4059-0
00:44:56.957 --> 00:44:57.037
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4083-0
00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:06.039
<v Ricky Horton>This is kind of a structure that they
want us to use for these buildings.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4083-1
00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:10.797
<v Ricky Horton>So we located 39 rejection this time will
be 391000.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4093-0
00:45:12.997 --> 00:45:21.117
<v Ricky Horton>Which is a typical,
it's longer than 39 and for company 40.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4121-0
00:45:23.557 --> 00:45:28.340
<v Ricky Horton>So Company 40,
Division 39 and then the activity levels</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4121-1
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:33.466
<v Ricky Horton>is where they break it out for.
So each so 39 is fab. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4121-2
00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:38.677
<v Ricky Horton>39 is anything we do with the structural
production. Got it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4123-0
00:45:39.277 --> 00:45:40.637
<v Ricky Horton>So and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4150-0
00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:47.562
<v Ricky Horton>Or electrical civil.
Each one has their own has their own</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4150-1
00:45:47.562 --> 00:45:51.817
<v Ricky Horton>thing,
so so everybody is 40 then beyond that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4150-2
00:45:51.817 --> 00:45:56.997
<v Ricky Horton>base codes associated with each trade and
area of work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4189-0
00:45:57.237 --> 00:46:00.768
<v Ricky Horton>Or what?
So if this fit goes all the way through</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4189-1
00:46:00.768 --> 00:46:04.083
<v Ricky Horton>low, yeah.
So if you were to look at company,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4189-2
00:46:04.083 --> 00:46:07.686
<v Ricky Horton>whatever,
you would see very same consistency for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4189-3
00:46:07.686 --> 00:46:13.092
<v Ricky Horton>the shop and Bloomfield. Yeah, yeah,
I think the same thing, to be honest,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4189-4
00:46:13.092 --> 00:46:14.317
<v Ricky Horton>not sure much of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4219-0
00:46:15.237 --> 00:46:22.627
<v Ricky Horton>No, I I get it. I don't either.
But I'm just curious if everything is the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4219-1
00:46:22.627 --> 00:46:27.821
<v Ricky Horton>same. Yeah, this is the laundry,
the standard fees,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4219-2
00:46:27.821 --> 00:46:31.117
<v Ricky Horton>the long gross supply and the so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4242-0
00:46:32.597 --> 00:46:38.408
<v Ricky Horton>Following with your other shops,
if you're reintegrating there or or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4242-1
00:46:38.408 --> 00:46:42.366
<v Ricky Horton>implementing this,
they are document crap out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4242-2
00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:47.757
<v Ricky Horton>The the best multi shop facilities I've
seen are the ones that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4277-0
00:46:48.357 --> 00:46:53.706
<v Ricky Horton>Document and they want to pull in here
and everybody's moving the exact same way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4277-1
00:46:53.706 --> 00:46:58.533
<v Ricky Horton>Don't allow them to do it differently.
Document it. Here's the procedure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4277-2
00:46:58.533 --> 00:47:01.991
<v Ricky Horton>Here's what we're going about.
Everybody's doing it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4277-3
00:47:01.991 --> 00:47:03.557
<v Ricky Horton>Don't make it an option.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4309-0
00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:08.846
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, otherwise it's mass chaos.
I just see it. No, you have to have it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4309-1
00:47:08.846 --> 00:47:13.758
<v Ricky Horton>And I think one of the things here is
flow charts and descriptions for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4309-2
00:47:13.758 --> 00:47:18.323
<v Ricky Horton>everything. I mean, heck,
when you do an ERP upgrade if you don't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4309-3
00:47:18.323 --> 00:47:18.877
<v Ricky Horton>have it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4318-0
00:47:19.237 --> 00:47:23.537
<v Ricky Horton>People think they know what it is,
but they have no idea what it is. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4318-1
00:47:23.537 --> 00:47:26.117
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
I learned that one hard way last year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4327-0
00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:32.917
<v Ricky Horton>So if you're if if you're using those 39
codes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4346-0
00:47:34.917 --> 00:47:44.288
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see an issue like I was thinking
that we were talking about the the codes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4346-1
00:47:44.288 --> 00:47:45.317
<v Ricky Horton>would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4364-0
00:47:45.957 --> 00:47:50.283
<v Ricky Horton>A beam might be one too,
depending on how it's it's used,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4364-1
00:47:50.283 --> 00:47:55.877
<v Ricky Horton>how what type of product it's going into,
and it might be a different one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4407-0
00:47:57.717 --> 00:48:04.338
<v Ricky Horton>For another type of sampling, yeah,
but I don't see those cadence here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4407-1
00:48:04.338 --> 00:48:08.384
<v Ricky Horton>I just see fabricated steel.
So this one's,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4407-2
00:48:08.384 --> 00:48:15.925
<v Ricky Horton>this one's most of the time are typical,
are typical face coat for labor and when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4407-3
00:48:15.925 --> 00:48:16.477
<v Ricky Horton>I get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4440-0
00:48:17.037 --> 00:48:24.002
<v Ricky Horton>Multiple sequences or multiple areas of
work. It'll be 391000.01.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4440-1
00:48:24.002 --> 00:48:32.445
<v Ricky Horton>That's just labor. What about material?
Material is 083 thousand is usually the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4440-2
00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:35.717
<v Ricky Horton>one that we initiate into them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4473-0
00:48:44.317 --> 00:48:49.790
<v Ricky Horton>So we usually take playing angles,
channels, beams, everything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4473-1
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get slumped up into that one phase.
So, so you're telling me that, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4473-2
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.317
<v Ricky Horton>if I have a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4527-0
00:48:58.957 --> 00:49:03.915
<v Ricky Horton>Piece of pipe that I use in a structural
project, it would be that 0830.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4527-1
00:49:03.915 --> 00:49:09.350
<v Ricky Horton>But if I use a piece of pipe on a rail,
it's still it's still going to be 0830.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4527-2
00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.474
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's most of the time they don't end up</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4527-3
00:49:12.474 --> 00:49:17.637
<v Ricky Horton>getting into the material hammer or
breaking everything on that thoroughly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4554-0
00:49:18.277 --> 00:49:22.869
<v Ricky Horton>They they usually keep everything into a
structural steel bucket.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4554-1
00:49:22.869 --> 00:49:28.295
<v Ricky Horton>The only time you will see that number
differ is if we have multiple material</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4554-2
00:49:28.295 --> 00:49:32.957
<v Ricky Horton>buckets for areas of work on the project.
OK, so that we can make.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4594-0
00:49:33.397 --> 00:49:38.558
<v Ricky Horton>So we can have one of the estimates
automatically give you the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4594-1
00:49:38.558 --> 00:49:43.236
<v Ricky Horton>That's easy to do.
What I was understanding was you might</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4594-2
00:49:43.236 --> 00:49:49.365
<v Ricky Horton>have one code which is structural,
a different code which is miscellaneous,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4594-3
00:49:49.365 --> 00:49:53.317
<v Ricky Horton>a different code if it's something that's
right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4641-0
00:49:53.437 --> 00:49:58.433
<v Ricky Horton>If that locates, that's more difficult.
Now you're basically going to have to say</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4641-1
00:49:58.433 --> 00:50:02.272
<v Ricky Horton>every single line item,
what that thing's going to be for that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4641-2
00:50:02.272 --> 00:50:05.197
<v Ricky Horton>material.
But if all materials are going to say</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4641-3
00:50:05.197 --> 00:50:08.853
<v Ricky Horton>things good, that's easy.
We can set it up to the estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4641-4
00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:12.997
<v Ricky Horton>Just at the end of the estimate,
here's all, here's all the things.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4666-0
00:50:13.077 --> 00:50:19.220
<v Ricky Horton>Which would be associated across.
So that's that that would be simple to do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4666-1
00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Ricky Horton>on the back end and you can put the you
would get it on the POS as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4666-2
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.677
<v Ricky Horton>So it would it would be a nearly
automatic.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4670-0
00:50:29.117 --> 00:50:32.557
<v Ricky Horton>Now your labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4708-0
00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:40.171
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Yeah. And then, I mean,
even if we were,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4708-1
00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:50.477
<v Ricky Horton>even if we put in the whole materials,
that's only 3000 and we did have one is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4742-0
00:50:50.757 --> 00:50:56.040
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the time it's going to be that
plus whatever connotation is going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4742-1
00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.599
<v Ricky Horton>differentiate it in the area of work if
the project's at large. Outside of that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4742-2
00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:06.677
<v Ricky Horton>then it's then it's basically that'll be
our governing code for material.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4777-0
00:51:08.117 --> 00:51:12.419
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of times,
depending upon the the project engineer</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4777-1
00:51:12.419 --> 00:51:16.794
<v Ricky Horton>and team team I'm working with for the
field project, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4777-2
00:51:16.794 --> 00:51:22.263
<v Ricky Horton>it'll be sometimes I get that same phase
code is that I've written all the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4777-3
00:51:22.263 --> 00:51:23.357
<v Ricky Horton>procedures for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4794-0
00:51:23.877 --> 00:51:29.886
<v Ricky Horton>PC forms, project release forms,
how we do the technical side of things,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4794-1
00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:35.237
<v Ricky Horton>how we expect projects to come in and
everything and so on that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4821-0
00:51:37.037 --> 00:51:43.266
<v Ricky Horton>Where's that information where you've
written all those procedures?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4821-1
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:48.396
<v Ricky Horton>Where's that?
I have to see where it's located in the R</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4821-2
00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:51.877
<v Ricky Horton>drive at this point or in the J drive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4825-0
00:51:52.717 --> 00:51:56.597
<v Ricky Horton>But I have a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4854-0
00:51:57.557 --> 00:52:03.904
<v Ricky Horton>Will you send me a link next week or
something? Yeah, I'd like to read that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4854-1
00:52:03.904 --> 00:52:07.778
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I've got procedures for any procedure or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4854-2
00:52:07.778 --> 00:52:12.477
<v Ricky Horton>form I've created for anything that we
have in the shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4892-0
00:52:13.037 --> 00:52:17.887
<v Ricky Horton>Checklists and associated.
So this is the form I created for when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4892-1
00:52:17.887 --> 00:52:23.987
<v Ricky Horton>somebody released the project to us using
project number, need dates, onsite date,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4892-2
00:52:23.987 --> 00:52:28.397
<v Ricky Horton>requirements, manager, project manager,
engineer, customer.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4915-0
00:52:29.197 --> 00:52:35.382
<v Ricky Horton>Client information, shipping address,
delivery site, who's handling it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4915-1
00:52:35.382 --> 00:52:40.107
<v Ricky Horton>coding specs,
whether or not the PE ordered any of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4915-2
00:52:40.107 --> 00:52:41.997
<v Ricky Horton>bio items or hardware.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4932-0
00:52:43.637 --> 00:52:49.208
<v Ricky Horton>Any specific project notes that we need
if the engineer pre-ordered any of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4932-1
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:51.677
<v Ricky Horton>materials and the PO is associated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4984-0
00:52:52.917 --> 00:52:56.049
<v Ricky Horton>And a lot of times we don't get a
breakdown.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4984-1
00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:59.737
<v Ricky Horton>So they'll send us the face code from
what they had.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4984-2
00:52:59.737 --> 00:53:03.705
<v Ricky Horton>So this is the change order.
So they ended up making 39,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4984-3
00:53:03.705 --> 00:53:07.393
<v Ricky Horton>000 change order #9 and they had 63 hours
estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/4984-4
00:53:07.393 --> 00:53:10.317
<v Ricky Horton>So at this point we would then look at it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5013-0
00:53:10.917 --> 00:53:15.876
<v Ricky Horton>And try and do our own breakdown just
based upon reviewing the prints.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5013-1
00:53:15.876 --> 00:53:20.137
<v Ricky Horton>And then as soon as what's what I would
do before you. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5013-2
00:53:20.137 --> 00:53:24.957
<v Ricky Horton>and I'm pretty certain this is not
estimated in that book. This was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5048-0
00:53:25.797 --> 00:53:31.361
<v Ricky Horton>And I think 63 hours is what we need for
that and that was just pushed through.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5048-1
00:53:31.361 --> 00:53:35.396
<v Ricky Horton>So that is something that you know I'm
I'm curious about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5048-2
00:53:35.396 --> 00:53:38.526
<v Ricky Horton>So the estimate does give you that break
in,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5048-3
00:53:38.526 --> 00:53:43.117
<v Ricky Horton>but it seems like they take the total and
they do their own work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5072-0
00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:48.681
<v Ricky Horton>Regardless of what I said,
does he have anything you want?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5072-1
00:53:48.681 --> 00:53:55.278
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of it is because I'll I'll even
modify it sometimes even on my own just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5072-2
00:53:55.278 --> 00:53:57.477
<v Ricky Horton>because like the burn time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5120-0
00:53:58.677 --> 00:54:04.395
<v Ricky Horton>It'll give us however many hours and then
I'll take those hours to look at the burn</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5120-1
00:54:04.395 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Ricky Horton>time and I'll pull up my pro nest and
I'll take the physical laser run time and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5120-2
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.265
<v Ricky Horton>then I'll assume we have an hour per
shoot, 15 minutes for load,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5120-3
00:54:14.265 --> 00:54:18.077
<v Ricky Horton>15 minutes for unload,
depending upon the scale of the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5158-0
00:54:18.277 --> 00:54:24.265
<v Ricky Horton>Bars that are on there and so burns one
that we see a lot of adjustment on from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5158-1
00:54:24.265 --> 00:54:29.953
<v Ricky Horton>what Tesla has for doing the perimeter
burn for the time calculated in here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5158-2
00:54:29.953 --> 00:54:35.717
<v Ricky Horton>versus what my laser time is saying plus
me factoring in loading, unloading.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5222-0
00:54:36.117 --> 00:54:39.985
<v Ricky Horton>We need to fix that.
I mean that's that's a very simple thing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5222-1
00:54:39.985 --> 00:54:42.980
<v Ricky Horton>to do.
So if you're constantly adjusting it and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5222-2
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.724
<v Ricky Horton>you know what you want to adjust it to,
that's easy to fix.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5222-3
00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:51.903
<v Ricky Horton>I was going to fix it is what I would do
so that that everybody's going to have to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5222-4
00:54:51.903 --> 00:54:55.397
<v Ricky Horton>re-estimate afterwards estimates,
you know, and having.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5253-0
00:54:55.637 --> 00:54:59.033
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
Would be another question about that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5253-1
00:54:59.033 --> 00:55:02.957
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
so that's that was one of the issues what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5253-2
00:55:02.957 --> 00:55:06.505
<v Ricky Horton>one day was, OK, we're starting to see it,
OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5253-3
00:55:06.505 --> 00:55:11.637
<v Ricky Horton>how do we know what we're we need to get
this to there were really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5291-0
00:55:12.757 --> 00:55:17.350
<v Ricky Horton>That was pretty perfect coming from shots.
So that was we established it when they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5291-1
00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:21.112
<v Ricky Horton>wanted that place though.
It's because what happens is they they go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5291-2
00:55:21.112 --> 00:55:23.768
<v Ricky Horton>through the hours and they use under the
hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5291-3
00:55:23.768 --> 00:55:28.029
<v Ricky Horton>They have guys that they want to keep as
the place because they're in place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5291-4
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:30.077
<v Ricky Horton>So they just tell them, oh, go ahead.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5335-0
00:55:30.277 --> 00:55:36.597
<v Ricky Horton>We have extra time on this job,
so close to that and would be still at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5335-1
00:55:36.597 --> 00:55:43.273
<v Ricky Horton>that time. That's what they're doing.
That's quite an hour. Yeah. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5335-2
00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:48.258
<v Ricky Horton>we can fix that.
So people are having to manipulate all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5335-3
00:55:48.258 --> 00:55:49.237
<v Ricky Horton>this stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5349-0
00:55:50.157 --> 00:55:54.558
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so you can.
We can definitely fix that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5349-1
00:55:54.558 --> 00:56:01.639
<v Ricky Horton>Who estimates this change order?
This one would probably Richard and this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5349-2
00:56:01.639 --> 00:56:04.797
<v Ricky Horton>one. Does he have access exactly?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5383-0
00:56:05.317 --> 00:56:08.774
<v Ricky Horton>There's not. Well,
they're not really estimating,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5383-1
00:56:08.774 --> 00:56:14.445
<v Ricky Horton>but they're estimating off the field in
some little spreadsheet, right? I'm sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5383-2
00:56:14.445 --> 00:56:18.248
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure too.
So that's why it's not in tech. Ideally,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5383-3
00:56:18.248 --> 00:56:21.637
<v Ricky Horton>in a lot it would be nice if everybody
use tech.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5419-0
00:56:21.677 --> 00:56:30.753
<v Ricky Horton>That's the end goal and and so unless one
of these BOT members reached out to Karam</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5419-1
00:56:30.753 --> 00:56:39.396
<v Ricky Horton>Hawk or myself and Gaylus is still the
work he has put this into the system and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5419-2
00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:40.477
<v Ricky Horton>estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5448-0
00:56:40.717 --> 00:56:44.702
<v Ricky Horton>More than likely,
this one was not estimated in Tekla.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5448-1
00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:50.210
<v Ricky Horton>Are you used to that document from the
field that was that they're actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5448-2
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:54.485
<v Ricky Horton>having access to Tekla in the field?
I have not seen that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5448-3
00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:56.877
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see it in the shop. Sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-0
00:56:57.157 --> 00:57:01.715
<v Ricky Horton>They do it if they have field access to
it, then the guys know how to use it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-1
00:57:01.715 --> 00:57:04.813
<v Ricky Horton>If they have a room,
there's another there's another</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-2
00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:07.384
<v Ricky Horton>fabricator here in Phoenix that's going
on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-3
00:57:07.384 --> 00:57:11.651
<v Ricky Horton>They've got a field for development
groups access all the girls in here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-4
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:14.748
<v Ricky Horton>They record.
Here's some material showed up on site.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5494-5
00:57:14.748 --> 00:57:16.677
<v Ricky Horton>Here's some material right there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5498-0
00:57:16.917 --> 00:57:20.597
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, is that happening here?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5501-0
00:57:23.117 --> 00:57:24.877
<v Ricky Horton>You know, there's probably.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5513-0
00:57:26.037 --> 00:57:34.557
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe 10 people that access that and of
this giant list of estimators.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5549-0
00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:39.966
<v Ricky Horton>This is Alan in there and he's done a few
test projects.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5549-1
00:57:39.966 --> 00:57:44.241
<v Ricky Horton>I estimated in your office that makes it
here as it's honest,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5549-2
00:57:44.241 --> 00:57:50.032
<v Ricky Horton>as it's orange estimates in your process.
So I mean I guess if you would have to do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5549-3
00:57:50.032 --> 00:57:50.997
<v Ricky Horton>change orders.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5582-0
00:57:52.197 --> 00:57:54.859
<v Ricky Horton>And the guys don't even know how to use
cycling.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5582-1
00:57:54.859 --> 00:57:58.283
<v Ricky Horton>That's a whole training exercise to get
that project managers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5582-2
00:57:58.283 --> 00:58:02.467
<v Ricky Horton>Most of them will do their own change.
I've always done 90% of my own change</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5582-3
00:58:02.467 --> 00:58:05.837
<v Ricky Horton>orders myself without going back to the
estimated department.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5617-0
00:58:06.597 --> 00:58:09.757
<v Ricky Horton>That's right.
Just because I had had the experience and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5617-1
00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:12.466
<v Ricky Horton>you know exactly what it's going to take.
Sure,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5617-2
00:58:12.466 --> 00:58:15.457
<v Ricky Horton>if I was here at this point now and see
your behind,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5617-3
00:58:15.457 --> 00:58:19.802
<v Ricky Horton>I will because I've never used the FBA
portion of tech, but I will learn it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5617-4
00:58:19.802 --> 00:58:24.317
<v Ricky Horton>And then that's why everybody can do it.
That's why I'll do it. That's the way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5663-0
00:58:24.797 --> 00:58:27.871
<v Ricky Horton>All day-to-day usage, super simple.
Very simple,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5663-1
00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:31.887
<v Ricky Horton>especially with the lever codes and
everything. I was actually,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5663-2
00:58:31.887 --> 00:58:34.773
<v Ricky Horton>but everything's got to be right in the
back.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5663-3
00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:39.918
<v Ricky Horton>I was actually hoping there'll be a bunch
of estimated in here this week with me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5663-4
00:58:39.918 --> 00:58:43.997
<v Ricky Horton>We're not doing a bunch of adjustments,
so we're supposed to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-0
00:58:44.277 --> 00:58:47.045
<v Ricky Horton>Where's the best place for me to go to
learn?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-1
00:58:47.045 --> 00:58:50.295
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just because you got a YouTube video
on yourself.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-2
00:58:50.295 --> 00:58:53.003
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody else wants to be different,
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-3
00:58:53.003 --> 00:58:56.554
<v Ricky Horton>So and everybody's got to set up a
different place, so no.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-4
00:58:56.554 --> 00:59:00.527
<v Ricky Horton>But it is really super. I get not set up.
If you figure that out,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5720-5
00:59:00.527 --> 00:59:03.837
<v Ricky Horton>let me know because I'm going to be in
the same place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5748-0
00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:09.577
<v Ricky Horton>This guy seems to be a wizard of
everything. I'm just having him say, hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5748-1
00:59:09.577 --> 00:59:15.498
<v Ricky Horton>I do that. So we got to do this business.
So yeah, working with kind of, well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5748-2
00:59:15.498 --> 00:59:21.793
<v Ricky Horton>say we're past the phase of the the basic,
except for there's a bunch of people are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5748-3
00:59:21.793 --> 00:59:23.517
<v Ricky Horton>using it, so they need.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5786-0
00:59:23.637 --> 00:59:27.016
<v Ricky Horton>That's right.
And I that's also that's here's,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5786-1
00:59:27.016 --> 00:59:30.468
<v Ricky Horton>here's how we use it here instead of
going out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5786-2
00:59:30.468 --> 00:59:36.364
<v Ricky Horton>I personally have to come to you because
there's no three years and I think other</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5786-3
00:59:36.364 --> 00:59:41.470
<v Ricky Horton>estimators they want to learn,
they should also come to one person who</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5786-4
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:42.117
<v Ricky Horton>say what.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5816-0
00:59:42.517 --> 00:59:51.358
<v Ricky Horton>That's where we've had lots of issues is
we have new estimators start coming in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5816-1
00:59:51.358 --> 00:59:59.757
<v Ricky Horton>and we're just doing long take offs of of
well in the system, so coming in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5851-0
01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:06.805
<v Ricky Horton>Going into this lower portion down here,
which nothing wrong with additional labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5851-1
01:00:06.805 --> 01:00:12.855
<v Ricky Horton>and and adding any of this to it,
but the main you already got it set up on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5851-2
01:00:12.855 --> 01:00:16.677
<v Ricky Horton>here the codes,
but I'm going to use the codes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5884-0
01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:23.345
<v Ricky Horton>Those capture so much more than just
adding well capture being put the holes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5884-1
01:00:23.345 --> 01:00:27.749
<v Ricky Horton>in it, the clips.
I've seen an estimator do this before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5884-2
01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:33.157
<v Ricky Horton>I just never estimated myself yet in the
system, so that makes sense.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5924-0
01:00:33.557 --> 01:00:38.875
<v Ricky Horton>And then those are talking about the
chart that got next to me on my peers. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5924-1
01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:42.067
<v Ricky Horton>hey, what's happening? Back that way,
you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5924-2
01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:47.385
<v Ricky Horton>So and that that's one area that we've
been our estimators on the job there and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5924-3
01:00:47.385 --> 01:00:52.438
<v Ricky Horton>one of the reasons that they're like, oh,
we're not getting a hold of these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5924-4
01:00:52.438 --> 01:00:53.037
<v Ricky Horton>projects.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5958-0
01:00:53.397 --> 01:00:57.381
<v Ricky Horton>And why are your guys's atlas so
different than some of these window</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5958-1
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:01.424
<v Ricky Horton>estimators that have come down?
They're coming in and doing the wrong</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5958-2
01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:06.043
<v Ricky Horton>well takeoffs when more of our senior
estimators are using labor codes and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5958-3
01:01:06.043 --> 01:01:10.317
<v Ricky Horton>using additional labor to fill in a gap
where we need additional fillets.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5986-0
01:01:10.677 --> 01:01:15.672
<v Ricky Horton>Or so on and so forth.
How many instructions on this lane is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5986-1
01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:20.339
<v Ricky Horton>estimated? Yeah,
they're actually using that just two or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5986-2
01:01:20.339 --> 01:01:23.942
<v Ricky Horton>three,
three that are dedicated estimators.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/5986-3
01:01:23.942 --> 01:01:28.037
<v Ricky Horton>One of those are Karal and Karal,
Isaac and Bach.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6022-0
01:01:28.557 --> 01:01:35.355
<v Ricky Horton>So who is Jesse? Oh, so he doesn't.
If he estimates himself,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6022-1
01:01:35.355 --> 01:01:44.048
<v Ricky Horton>it's probably directly in heavy bid and
he's probably more estimating the the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6022-2
01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:46.277
<v Ricky Horton>field portion of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6059-0
01:01:46.357 --> 01:01:50.021
<v Ricky Horton>Anything fab that's associated with
Jesse's department.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6059-1
01:01:50.021 --> 01:01:54.471
<v Ricky Horton>Usually it's first to Karam.
Karam is our most senior estimator and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6059-2
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:59.445
<v Ricky Horton>where do those kids sit? Are they Gilbert?
They have the 4th floor, second,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6059-3
01:01:59.445 --> 01:02:04.157
<v Ricky Horton>third floor. So I'm on the third floor,
but I've never been discussing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6100-0
01:02:04.277 --> 01:02:09.348
<v Ricky Horton>They don't keep coming here all week
because they were gone all last week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6100-1
01:02:09.348 --> 01:02:13.068
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah, yeah,
they all said it's like an official set</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6100-2
01:02:13.068 --> 01:02:16.449
<v Ricky Horton>of offices.
Jesse's in one of those and they said</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6100-3
01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:21.115
<v Ricky Horton>outside of his office. Well,
they must be on the first floor is that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6100-4
01:02:21.115 --> 01:02:22.197
<v Ricky Horton>official office.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6103-0
01:02:24.797 --> 01:02:25.197
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6130-0
01:02:27.717 --> 01:02:34.269
<v Ricky Horton>I keep coming back to the I I think, yeah,
yeah, we can do this integration stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6130-1
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:40.032
<v Ricky Horton>That's not a big deal. I swear.
I think our time will be very well spent</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6130-2
01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:42.717
<v Ricky Horton>correctly. Yeah, I agree with you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6171-0
01:02:43.157 --> 01:02:50.018
<v Ricky Horton>I think you'll get more buying from
everybody else if the hours coming out of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6171-1
01:02:50.018 --> 01:02:55.032
<v Ricky Horton>it are realistic.
I I think we had we we'd be better off</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6171-2
01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Ricky Horton>doing this.
Now we can make these labor groups do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6171-3
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.157
<v Ricky Horton>exactly what what that endling.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6206-0
01:03:02.637 --> 01:03:12.526
<v Ricky Horton>We can make this exactly that if you want.
That's that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6206-1
01:03:12.526 --> 01:03:21.357
<v Ricky Horton>That would be a hell of a lot better.
And that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6261-0
01:03:21.637 --> 01:03:26.773
<v Ricky Horton>Another area where we have confusion is
this layout going to handling,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6261-1
01:03:26.773 --> 01:03:31.402
<v Ricky Horton>this layout going to fit.
Most of the time it goes into fit and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6261-2
01:03:31.402 --> 01:03:35.091
<v Ricky Horton>then but we also have a fit up category
interview.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6261-3
01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:40.517
<v Ricky Horton>So category five and seven are going in
one category and then we got Weld.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6310-0
01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:44.873
<v Ricky Horton>And then we have clean material handling
and material handling in here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6310-1
01:03:44.873 --> 01:03:49.775
<v Ricky Horton>So if we simplify these labor groups out
to basically what my PC form has on it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6310-2
01:03:49.775 --> 01:03:52.619
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
with the exception of I need to add burn</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6310-3
01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:55.644
<v Ricky Horton>to this, yeah,
then we're going to keep getting a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6310-4
01:03:55.644 --> 01:03:59.517
<v Ricky Horton>consistent breakout. So yeah,
are you the master of this topic?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6331-0
01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Ricky Horton>So why not fix it? Yeah.
So I'm I'm open to come up into this deal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6331-1
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.508
<v Ricky Horton>I think my time would be last very soon
there and talk about this this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6331-2
01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:15.157
<v Ricky Horton>integration after we fix this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6359-0
01:04:15.557 --> 01:04:19.821
<v Ricky Horton>Then we can set it up,
set it up relatively quickly for it to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6359-1
01:04:19.821 --> 01:04:25.462
<v Ricky Horton>just give you the breakdown of the hour.
I used to get it too if you want, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6359-2
01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:30.277
<v Ricky Horton>We're breaking a whole less than not just
an hour, so let's do it so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6374-0
01:04:30.597 --> 01:04:35.164
<v Ricky Horton>I would kind of suggest here you just do
new ones down at the bottom,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6374-1
01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:38.557
<v Ricky Horton>then we'll redirect and come back and
delete these.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6395-0
01:04:39.957 --> 01:04:43.381
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe you're talking to Phil,
your layout to speak,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6395-1
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:47.677
<v Ricky Horton>cost about two categories and you need a
number for the label group.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6406-0
01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.171
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's gonna be,
it's gonna freak out on your dad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6406-1
01:04:56.171 --> 01:04:57.677
<v Ricky Horton>She's gonna be a number.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6413-0
01:05:03.397 --> 01:05:06.517
<v Ricky Horton>Also a little return of here that we just
had.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6446-0
01:05:08.877 --> 01:05:14.907
<v Ricky Horton>Everything to do with cutting was one
through 9 laser, press break,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6446-1
01:05:14.907 --> 01:05:20.317
<v Ricky Horton>water jet one through 9.
Everything to do with fiddle was 10</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6446-2
01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:24.397
<v Ricky Horton>through 19.
Everything to do with welding so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6486-0
01:05:24.597 --> 01:05:27.745
<v Ricky Horton>We just had things in groups of 10
because somebody wanted.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6486-1
01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:31.732
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes somebody would say, well,
I want welding for this and welding for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6486-2
01:05:31.732 --> 01:05:35.668
<v Ricky Horton>that. It would stay within the same.
It would stay within the same family.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6486-3
01:05:35.668 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Ricky Horton>That's just the way I'm used to doing it,
not having them all over the place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6486-4
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.597
<v Ricky Horton>And then when you make the routing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6493-0
01:05:41.717 --> 01:05:45.837
<v Ricky Horton>The routing flow through the shop.
They break that activity, by the way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6498-0
01:05:48.197 --> 01:05:50.477
<v Ricky Horton>Um, let's set that to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6529-0
01:05:51.757 --> 01:06:00.968
<v Ricky Horton>On these in this production it it it has
some effect so specifically like you know</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6529-1
01:06:00.968 --> 01:06:07.517
<v Ricky Horton>and either you can break it down by that
each year or two.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6567-0
01:06:08.237 --> 01:06:19.173
<v Ricky Horton>So cut his saw and burn his plasma table.
Yeah, yeah, I think the most part,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6567-1
01:06:19.173 --> 01:06:27.837
<v Ricky Horton>especially the ones with the auto clips
and whatnot, like H.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6612-0
01:06:27.957 --> 01:06:34.451
<v Ricky Horton>And I are very common ones that we use.
I think columns that runway estimates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6612-1
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:40.780
<v Ricky Horton>I can hit a runway estimate then 10
minutes and that's cool and welding base</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6612-2
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:45.795
<v Ricky Horton>plate on both ends.
And then we have in there type H quarter</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6612-3
01:06:45.795 --> 01:06:47.357
<v Ricky Horton>H type H516 type H.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6632-0
01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:54.770
<v Ricky Horton>3/8 So as the fillet size increases, um,
you can just plug that lever code and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6632-1
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:59.597
<v Ricky Horton>Jeff, I'm cutting.
I've got a question here cut in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6641-0
01:07:01.437 --> 01:07:07.357
<v Ricky Horton>So you've got plate plasma cutting,
but you've also got plasma shaped cutting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6682-0
01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:15.340
<v Ricky Horton>And then you've got saw cutting.
So saw is cut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6682-1
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:21.985
<v Ricky Horton>What is plasma cutting in plate or what
is plasma cutting in shapes?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6682-2
01:07:21.985 --> 01:07:27.282
<v Ricky Horton>It's still so.
So how do you differentiate the time it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6682-3
01:07:27.282 --> 01:07:30.557
<v Ricky Horton>takes to saw cut something versus?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6689-0
01:07:30.677 --> 01:07:36.277
<v Ricky Horton>Burn cut the shape so with with that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6720-0
01:07:37.717 --> 01:07:41.992
<v Ricky Horton>I guess we haven't really,
we haven't really broken that out and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6720-1
01:07:41.992 --> 01:07:47.058
<v Ricky Horton>that's another area where we've been
trying to fine tune is I'll pull the up</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6720-2
01:07:47.058 --> 01:07:51.597
<v Ricky Horton>all the reports from Land Tech and see
what their run times are and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6752-0
01:07:53.397 --> 01:08:00.144
<v Ricky Horton>Anything associated with that,
I'll in a separate hours of this is your</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6752-1
01:08:00.144 --> 01:08:07.078
<v Ricky Horton>ACPC time associated with this for
running channels and Eagles and that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6752-2
01:08:07.078 --> 01:08:10.077
<v Ricky Horton>always factored into our budget.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6791-0
01:08:10.957 --> 01:08:16.431
<v Ricky Horton>Because if the ACPC goes down,
which is more common than like like it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6791-1
01:08:16.431 --> 01:08:20.264
<v Ricky Horton>could ever be,
everything defaults past the saw.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6791-2
01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:24.878
<v Ricky Horton>You still have five,
you still have minutes or even piece.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6791-3
01:08:24.878 --> 01:08:30.197
<v Ricky Horton>So you as far as the actual time,
that's Monday regardless of what.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6824-0
01:08:30.517 --> 01:08:33.920
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's,
but this just slowns up all those hours</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6824-1
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.997
<v Ricky Horton>of calculation background.
But what would you,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6824-2
01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:42.233
<v Ricky Horton>what would you see normally in the shop?
If you have different cutting centers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6824-3
01:08:42.233 --> 01:08:46.488
<v Ricky Horton>do they have different codes?
Most of my logics you get federal,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6824-4
01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.517
<v Ricky Horton>it doesn't matter how it's cut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6873-0
01:08:48.597 --> 01:08:51.462
<v Ricky Horton>But they're not tracking it.
They're not used.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6873-1
01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:56.400
<v Ricky Horton>But I mean if I were estimating it and I
had something that was twice as fast as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6873-2
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.936
<v Ricky Horton>something else,
my goal would be to feed that work center</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6873-3
01:08:59.936 --> 01:09:04.996
<v Ricky Horton>because I knew it was twice as fast. Yeah,
and they're not making that decision on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6873-4
01:09:04.996 --> 01:09:07.557
<v Ricky Horton>the estimate as far as which 1% it can be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6893-0
01:09:08.517 --> 01:09:14.192
<v Ricky Horton>14 and 22 takes this this amount of time.
One less by the imports was less by a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6893-1
01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:18.945
<v Ricky Horton>slot, less by one inward.
Here's the amount of time to work at it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6893-2
01:09:18.945 --> 01:09:22.989
<v Ricky Horton>So OK, I mean,
I can see huge differences in the time of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6893-3
01:09:22.989 --> 01:09:23.557
<v Ricky Horton>the job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6918-0
01:09:23.637 --> 01:09:27.482
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But you know,
most of the time, the 14th,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6918-1
01:09:27.482 --> 01:09:31.086
<v Ricky Horton>20 years will be cut on one machine,
correct. So therefore,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6918-2
01:09:31.086 --> 01:09:35.832
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not paying which machine I'm saying
that they don't really have a big mind</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6918-3
01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:39.197
<v Ricky Horton>here. They have,
they went box out yesterday, they got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6958-0
01:09:39.557 --> 01:09:44.096
<v Ricky Horton>Kind of immediately minded as channels on
the bank and they don't have any of those</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6958-1
01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.636
<v Ricky Horton>beeps.
So they're all kind of normal software.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6958-2
01:09:46.636 --> 01:09:50.689
<v Ricky Horton>I guess sometimes they buy out though.
Quite often it would simply buy out</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6958-3
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:54.797
<v Ricky Horton>everybody from somebody that doesn't have
to be minded that they'll cut it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6991-0
01:09:54.997 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Ricky Horton>You know, when they get the beam line,
if we get cut,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6991-1
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.846
<v Ricky Horton>Chancellor put polls in March,
it's correct. Last year,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6991-2
01:10:02.846 --> 01:10:06.628
<v Ricky Horton>actually this year alone,
you would have spent $700,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/6991-3
01:10:06.628 --> 01:10:11.837
<v Ricky Horton>000 in selling beams and then what's the
chief of beam line that you're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7017-0
01:10:12.277 --> 01:10:18.978
<v Ricky Horton>Like a Python little Python XI have no
idea what what's cheap to say.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7017-1
01:10:18.978 --> 01:10:26.254
<v Ricky Horton>Working can well, all these people,
but probably if a bit dev can probably,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7017-2
01:10:26.254 --> 01:10:29.797
<v Ricky Horton>but I don't know that I'll get it so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7045-0
01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:34.446
<v Ricky Horton>I hope,
I hope that more long-term then what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7045-1
01:10:34.446 --> 01:10:41.664
<v Ricky Horton>where do I think I might be five years
from now if I think I might need the full</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7045-2
01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:43.357
<v Ricky Horton>system saw a drill.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7091-0
01:10:45.477 --> 01:10:48.486
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'm gonna buy something that can be part</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7091-1
01:10:48.486 --> 01:10:52.584
<v Ricky Horton>of a system that I can add to you.
You know, like the Portland,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7091-2
01:10:52.584 --> 01:10:57.771
<v Ricky Horton>it's a whole system, but I I wanted the,
I wanted the automation of the movement</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7091-3
01:10:57.771 --> 01:11:01.228
<v Ricky Horton>of the material.
I didn't want to gather the joystick</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7091-4
01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:02.317
<v Ricky Horton>moving and stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7126-0
01:11:02.597 --> 01:11:06.287
<v Ricky Horton>So that meant I wanted a system that
works together.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7126-1
01:11:06.287 --> 01:11:09.837
<v Ricky Horton>And so I I we actually got Bicep,
which does that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7126-2
01:11:09.837 --> 01:11:14.502
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm not familiar with it.
I've priced them out. Workman, Bicep,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7126-3
01:11:14.502 --> 01:11:17.357
<v Ricky Horton>Python X. Yeah, I've priced them out and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7175-0
01:11:17.757 --> 01:11:21.452
<v Ricky Horton>Hey,
does it matter how many times a week you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7175-1
01:11:21.452 --> 01:11:26.833
<v Ricky Horton>want to do? Hey, just, hey,
do this substantive and repurpose like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7175-2
01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:33.581
<v Ricky Horton>bid up instead of bid because we we don't
have to be $40, you know what I'm saying?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7175-3
01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:37.517
<v Ricky Horton>So get rid of the 22 and make seven up
there 22.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7186-0
01:11:37.837 --> 01:11:41.873
<v Ricky Horton>Or something like that, right?
In order to move it down or something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7186-1
01:11:41.873 --> 01:11:45.794
<v Ricky Horton>You follow what I'm saying? Yeah.
That way we don't like to repoint</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7186-2
01:11:45.794 --> 01:11:46.717
<v Ricky Horton>everything else.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7192-0
01:11:51.237 --> 01:11:55.157
<v Ricky Horton>And probably the same with burger as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7197-0
01:12:01.237 --> 01:12:03.757
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry, I wasn't watching that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7244-0
01:12:11.637 --> 01:12:16.287
<v Ricky Horton>I think next week I may go to Gilbert,
just to take what you want to do instead</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7244-1
01:12:16.287 --> 01:12:20.356
<v Ricky Horton>of start with those guys and see how you
do it. I'm going to do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7244-2
01:12:20.356 --> 01:12:24.948
<v Ricky Horton>It seems like after today, tomorrow,
the next day we finish this and that's my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7244-3
01:12:24.948 --> 01:12:27.157
<v Ricky Horton>next thing. It would be a lot of time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7278-0
01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:32.365
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm going up the place about 5:40 and
nobody's there. I'm the first one in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7278-1
01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:37.646
<v Ricky Horton>I'm the guy walks in and turns the lights
on. OK, and then I'm leaving, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7278-2
01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:42.477
<v Ricky Horton>637 o'clock to come here and that's when
people are starting to stroll in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7308-0
01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:46.895
<v Ricky Horton>And there's a couple of people. Well,
he used to give me graphic.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7308-1
01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:50.474
<v Ricky Horton>I'll show him at six. OK,
now because it was too early.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7308-2
01:12:50.474 --> 01:12:55.268
<v Ricky Horton>Now I wasn't early enough quickly.
Now they move over to the big corporate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7308-3
01:12:55.268 --> 01:13:00.317
<v Ricky Horton>office. Eight o'clock's pretty good.
That wasn't one of the working of things.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7311-0
01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.037
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I want to get up there once.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7327-0
01:13:04.117 --> 01:13:09.957
<v Ricky Horton>You'll you'll probably want since you're
since coatings will be in here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7327-1
01:13:09.957 --> 01:13:13.237
<v Ricky Horton>then you'll want the clean and the paint.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7329-0
01:13:14.237 --> 01:13:14.477
<v Ricky Horton>As well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7365-0
01:13:17.677 --> 01:13:21.946
<v Ricky Horton>Is that material handling of that label
there?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7365-1
01:13:21.946 --> 01:13:27.577
<v Ricky Horton>Is that what is the material in order
that it is allowed? No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7365-2
01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:35.117
<v Ricky Horton>that one we can probably just update to
just clean, but that's that's one area of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7410-0
01:13:37.397 --> 01:13:44.108
<v Ricky Horton>On the area of confusion we've had since
we have two areas of material, yeah, so,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7410-1
01:13:44.108 --> 01:13:48.036
<v Ricky Horton>but we can adjust that so that it's a
included.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7410-2
01:13:48.036 --> 01:13:53.601
<v Ricky Horton>I see you got #10 if they have people
that's the full pending vote.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7410-3
01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:56.957
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have one for partial pending vote?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7430-0
01:13:57.317 --> 01:14:01.477
<v Ricky Horton>Basic world or what?
Everything other than the full.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7430-1
01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:06.500
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have a box anyway.
Everything other than the full can will</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7430-2
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.797
<v Ricky Horton>is going anywhere. OK, now I can split up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-0
01:14:10.757 --> 01:14:13.754
<v Ricky Horton>Which that's a good point too.
We've got there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-1
01:14:13.754 --> 01:14:17.939
<v Ricky Horton>I'm wondering why these things are
ordered by code like, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-2
01:14:17.939 --> 01:14:21.249
<v Ricky Horton>one through 10 together.
That's why I used to. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-3
01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:24.184
<v Ricky Horton>that kind of makes sense to me.
I'm wondering,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-4
01:14:24.184 --> 01:14:28.993
<v Ricky Horton>would that be easier in the long run for
an estimator to say that, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7475-5
01:14:28.993 --> 01:14:30.117
<v Ricky Horton>it cuts down here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7500-0
01:14:30.357 --> 01:14:39.013
<v Ricky Horton>Like layouts up here, like this.
You go click, click, click, click, click,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7500-1
01:14:39.013 --> 01:14:45.477
<v Ricky Horton>and maybe. But I see that group. Oh, OK,
so that would.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7531-0
01:14:46.077 --> 01:14:51.242
<v Ricky Horton>You don't see that in the estimate.
They're going through selecting these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7531-1
01:14:51.242 --> 01:14:54.803
<v Ricky Horton>options.
The main thing we're getting right now is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7531-2
01:14:54.803 --> 01:15:00.597
<v Ricky Horton>when they pull up their estimate summary,
all of these descriptions are available.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7570-0
01:15:01.237 --> 01:15:05.493
<v Ricky Horton>These different paths are dividing up
across so many different but these ones</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7570-1
01:15:05.493 --> 01:15:07.949
<v Ricky Horton>here are out-of-the-box or did you pay
them?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7570-2
01:15:07.949 --> 01:15:12.259
<v Ricky Horton>These are out-of-the-box and you they
already have this shows but they already</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7570-3
01:15:12.259 --> 01:15:14.933
<v Ricky Horton>have both of that home plate for assigned
to it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7570-4
01:15:14.933 --> 01:15:18.917
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah this one's this one's given to us by
template. Yeah and then we've.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7614-0
01:15:18.997 --> 01:15:24.016
<v Ricky Horton>The only thing we've really done,
I guess we've made any custom ones in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7614-1
01:15:24.016 --> 01:15:27.850
<v Ricky Horton>there, but we have made some ones as well.
So you say,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7614-2
01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:31.126
<v Ricky Horton>have you made custom assemblies like a
ladder,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7614-3
01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:35.448
<v Ricky Horton>but three different kinds of ladders for
physical disclosure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7614-4
01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.237
<v Ricky Horton>We do that assembly stuff like that, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7641-0
01:15:38.837 --> 01:15:42.646
<v Ricky Horton>So that's more of more of what our core
estimators here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7641-1
01:15:42.646 --> 01:15:45.654
<v Ricky Horton>Kron's probably the only one who's using
it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7641-2
01:15:45.654 --> 01:15:49.531
<v Ricky Horton>It's pop didn't get a good understanding
of it last time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7641-3
01:15:49.531 --> 01:15:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>I would like to be one of the guys that
learns how to do that ****, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7682-0
01:15:54.917 --> 01:16:00.152
<v Ricky Horton>That's I've I've done that, you know,
they said on another thing and it's like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7682-1
01:16:00.152 --> 01:16:03.731
<v Ricky Horton>it's what Microsoft,
I see how the time is, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7682-2
01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:08.701
<v Ricky Horton>I'll count plates on a lot of them.
I can say two plates on a lot of them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7682-3
01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:10.557
<v Ricky Horton>That's a lot of them, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7717-0
01:16:13.317 --> 01:16:16.224
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
one thing I am curious about is sometimes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7717-1
01:16:16.224 --> 01:16:21.008
<v Ricky Horton>I have customers supply me with kiss
files and they have well program. Mm-hmm.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7717-2
01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:24.339
<v Ricky Horton>Is there a way to enforce and not have
that, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7717-3
01:16:24.339 --> 01:16:28.397
<v Ricky Horton>not have a little community,
but we have better control over this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7753-0
01:16:28.677 --> 01:16:34.743
<v Ricky Horton>I've I've been able to give a a global
head of the official down there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7753-1
01:16:34.743 --> 01:16:41.820
<v Ricky Horton>So you can still reply and all that. Yeah,
because I've never seen a e-mail in your</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7753-2
01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:47.044
<v Ricky Horton>wheelchair, right.
So I don't want the nuts coming in at all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7753-3
01:16:47.044 --> 01:16:48.477
<v Ricky Horton>No, not a chance.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7785-0
01:16:48.517 --> 01:16:54.768
<v Ricky Horton>I plug it in and it plugs in at 1000
hours and then the doctor down and and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7785-1
01:16:54.768 --> 01:17:01.183
<v Ricky Horton>typically it's less because they'll have
like 3 foot of weld and then there's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7785-2
01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:06.283
<v Ricky Horton>eight of them for one.
But like and it'll be it's two and two</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7785-3
01:17:06.283 --> 01:17:07.517
<v Ricky Horton>cap gets on it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7812-0
01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:11.773
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
Are you are you typically getting it from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7812-1
01:17:11.773 --> 01:17:16.217
<v Ricky Horton>the detail or OK,
I will say get it from the detail.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7812-2
01:17:16.217 --> 01:17:21.751
<v Ricky Horton>I would get the IC model.
They could use a model here after this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7812-3
01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:27.117
<v Ricky Horton>but they the detailer can turn the web
off on the next to work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7853-0
01:17:27.637 --> 01:17:32.746
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, no, there's there's no one.
I submit a a developer question like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7853-1
01:17:32.746 --> 01:17:36.632
<v Ricky Horton>because I'll ask what we have to have a
global. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7853-2
01:17:36.632 --> 01:17:42.533
<v Ricky Horton>it's the delete or remove it because then
I'm going through and you're like click</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7853-3
01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:43.037
<v Ricky Horton>delete.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7895-0
01:17:43.477 --> 01:17:46.914
<v Ricky Horton>Why you open?
Click delete because you can't even go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7895-1
01:17:46.914 --> 01:17:51.064
<v Ricky Horton>into the highway all and delete one of
the. You have to go 111.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7895-2
01:17:51.064 --> 01:17:55.085
<v Ricky Horton>It is terribly diagonal.
So now we can we can go in and point</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7895-3
01:17:55.085 --> 01:18:00.337
<v Ricky Horton>everything to the new box and got or then
we'll come back and delete the rest of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7895-4
01:18:00.337 --> 01:18:00.597
<v Ricky Horton>the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7913-0
01:18:00.837 --> 01:18:03.833
<v Ricky Horton>And then we'll have it much more
simplified.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7913-1
01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:07.361
<v Ricky Horton>So you go to operations to do that labor
operations.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7913-2
01:18:07.361 --> 01:18:10.757
<v Ricky Horton>So estimating labor maintenance,
labor operations.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7934-0
01:18:13.957 --> 01:18:18.501
<v Ricky Horton>There'll be a few other places,
so this is where we just want to get it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7934-1
01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:22.477
<v Ricky Horton>going to the right area.
So this is a little bit tedious, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7954-0
01:18:24.837 --> 01:18:32.919
<v Ricky Horton>So it might be easiest to say like sort
by labor group and then just repoint the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7954-1
01:18:32.919 --> 01:18:33.917
<v Ricky Horton>groupings.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7988-0
01:18:35.797 --> 01:18:40.422
<v Ricky Horton>Check wherever that be going.
Do you need that separated out?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7988-1
01:18:40.422 --> 01:18:44.525
<v Ricky Horton>Come to think of it.
I know that it was said we don't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7988-2
01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:47.882
<v Ricky Horton>That time's not even,
but it is an estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7988-3
01:18:47.882 --> 01:18:50.717
<v Ricky Horton>I think there's logging at the end of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/7991-0
01:18:51.597 --> 01:18:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but we need it split up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8022-0
01:18:59.757 --> 01:19:03.286
<v Ricky Horton>No,
I think we could just let's because yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8022-1
01:19:03.286 --> 01:19:06.893
<v Ricky Horton>right now anything quality control wise
it is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8022-2
01:19:06.893 --> 01:19:12.188
<v Ricky Horton>There's a separate empty bucket that's
added to every project. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8022-3
01:19:12.188 --> 01:19:14.797
<v Ricky Horton>and PC just adds their time to it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8061-0
01:19:15.237 --> 01:19:19.439
<v Ricky Horton>So you're not checking everyone,
each and everyone is saying individually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8061-1
01:19:19.439 --> 01:19:22.563
<v Ricky Horton>and saying, Oh yeah,
we're going to check this one up,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8061-2
01:19:22.563 --> 01:19:26.312
<v Ricky Horton>check that one up. Well,
and that's the other part because I mean</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8061-3
01:19:26.312 --> 01:19:29.322
<v Ricky Horton>the fitters should be doing their own
checks before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8061-4
01:19:29.322 --> 01:19:32.957
<v Ricky Horton>So most of this check on gets wanted to
go around that time of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8092-0
01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:39.213
<v Ricky Horton>Check done by the actual.
I don't know if you were a shop that was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8092-1
01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:44.229
<v Ricky Horton>doing nothing,
but there's thousands of operations you'd</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8092-2
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:47.837
<v Ricky Horton>have, but what I see out here, it's more.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8096-0
01:19:50.957 --> 01:19:53.717
<v Ricky Horton>It's like I'll check a bean, all bean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8126-0
01:19:55.877 --> 01:19:58.971
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes they can only spot.
They can only spot check.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8126-1
01:19:58.971 --> 01:20:01.679
<v Ricky Horton>They can get 10 meetings.
Let me go check on my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8126-2
01:20:01.679 --> 01:20:05.492
<v Ricky Horton>I'll try to look here. Well,
I walked a couple of them a couple days</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8126-3
01:20:05.492 --> 01:20:08.477
<v Ricky Horton>ago, but I could see marks on. Yeah,
on the meetings.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8134-0
01:20:10.037 --> 01:20:14.357
<v Ricky Horton>Like somebody had put a clip on and then
grabbed it off properly or whatever.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8135-0
01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:16.877
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8159-0
01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:58.077
<v Ricky Horton>I can sign that to you by what if if you
just say like to get through it then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8203-0
01:20:59.477 --> 01:21:04.971
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, a little different risk to do it.
So let me get you together with my son.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8203-1
01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:08.474
<v Ricky Horton>My son does the he works at Shop Money's
work net.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8203-2
01:21:08.474 --> 01:21:13.351
<v Ricky Horton>He he does all of the programming
production controls for his son that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8203-3
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:16.717
<v Ricky Horton>makes it PC.
So he's all of his constantly like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8239-0
01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:21.396
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
he he's actually living with one of their</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8239-1
01:21:21.396 --> 01:21:25.889
<v Ricky Horton>guys,
so I can get him with my guy Chris to try</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8239-2
01:21:25.889 --> 01:21:32.629
<v Ricky Horton>and get him in an integration.
That would be super sweet. Yeah, my son,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8239-3
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:35.437
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just screw you about ACP.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8278-0
01:21:35.637 --> 01:21:40.169
<v Ricky Horton>This year, every time they do an update,
they end up destroying all of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8278-1
01:21:40.169 --> 01:21:45.064
<v Ricky Horton>settings that I have made to put into my
stuff because they don't offer any sort</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8278-2
01:21:45.064 --> 01:21:48.509
<v Ricky Horton>of guideline.
I'm looking through the paper from manual,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8278-3
01:21:48.509 --> 01:21:52.437
<v Ricky Horton>putting in the feed rates,
putting it in top quality, yeah, and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8310-0
01:21:52.437 --> 01:21:57.503
<v Ricky Horton>Which is fine. I know how to do it.
It's definitely trained me how to do it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8310-1
01:21:57.503 --> 01:22:02.437
<v Ricky Horton>quite well. Yeah, but if I'm not, um,
that machine's not gonna run. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8310-2
01:22:02.437 --> 01:22:08.037
<v Ricky Horton>if I'm on vacation, they give me a call.
I'm trying to run 316 stainless right now,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8310-3
01:22:08.037 --> 01:22:08.237
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8339-0
01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:15.771
<v Ricky Horton>I'm doing a I'm doing a website for
support and I'm going to have as far as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8339-1
01:22:15.771 --> 01:22:23.869
<v Ricky Horton>that I'm going to have where clients can
get together and talk about that stuff at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8339-2
01:22:23.869 --> 01:22:24.357
<v Ricky Horton>ACPC.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8371-0
01:22:24.597 --> 01:22:30.690
<v Ricky Horton>Who should donate to the PC?
Here's what I'm struggling with.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8371-1
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:38.257
<v Ricky Horton>I want to add on there as well. Yeah,
having the the chat boards for for the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8371-2
01:22:38.257 --> 01:22:39.437
<v Ricky Horton>fabrication.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8389-0
01:22:39.717 --> 01:22:43.409
<v Ricky Horton>Like monthly webinars and stuff too,
where I I will try to get some of these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8389-1
01:22:43.409 --> 01:22:46.719
<v Ricky Horton>guys come on and say, hey,
let's listen to your clients and see what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8389-2
01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.877
<v Ricky Horton>they say, what they want, you know?
Oh yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8412-0
01:22:52.997 --> 01:22:58.939
<v Ricky Horton>I'd definitely be interested in that
'cause I'm always, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8412-1
01:22:58.939 --> 01:23:04.417
<v Ricky Horton>once you're in the industry,
you're in the industry. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8412-2
01:23:04.417 --> 01:23:08.317
<v Ricky Horton>So no matter where you are, it's a it's a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8413-0
01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:09.677
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8424-0
01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:19.597
<v Ricky Horton>He said what do you style that we want to
do that this one we will put into our.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8432-0
01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:25.197
<v Ricky Horton>So I'd say we put on the check into our
fifth category, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8441-0
01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:37.037
<v Ricky Horton>Because they made it clear.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8482-0
01:23:39.877 --> 01:23:46.559
<v Ricky Horton>So you're so it really is the quality guy
is not responsible anymore.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8482-1
01:23:46.559 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Ricky Horton>It's just the bidder that's responsible.
So the bidder is checking the fitment</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8482-2
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:59.637
<v Ricky Horton>prior to the going to load it and then
the GC comes over.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8520-0
01:24:00.197 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Ricky Horton>As on that was on inspection report.
So QC is still doing a check,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8520-1
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.903
<v Ricky Horton>but QC dollars are tracked on a
completely separate code on every single</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8520-2
01:24:10.903 --> 01:24:14.879
<v Ricky Horton>project. OK,
so QC knows where to put their time on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8520-3
01:24:14.879 --> 01:24:18.397
<v Ricky Horton>the project. Yeah, OK, yeah.
So when we were.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8534-0
01:24:18.877 --> 01:24:23.025
<v Ricky Horton>When we were looking at this previous
project schedule,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8534-1
01:24:23.025 --> 01:24:26.877
<v Ricky Horton>which we can see that everyone should
have in here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8568-0
01:24:28.837 --> 01:24:32.604
<v Ricky Horton>It's the same code for every single
project,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8568-1
01:24:32.604 --> 01:24:38.547
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm just amazed without the
estimators to see her integration with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8568-2
01:24:38.547 --> 01:24:43.989
<v Ricky Horton>this two topics would be just a problem.
So yeah, where's staff?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8568-3
01:24:43.989 --> 01:24:48.677
<v Ricky Horton>I actually expected the quality control
is always zero.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8579-0
01:24:51.677 --> 01:24:56.677
<v Ricky Horton>011400 so OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8612-0
01:24:58.277 --> 01:25:03.850
<v Ricky Horton>And I cannot know the other thing.
He was still up. People are unsustained,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8612-1
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:08.250
<v Ricky Horton>wasn't telling me.
I've done this port to copy it up there,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8612-2
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:13.970
<v Ricky Horton>copy the and then you just paste it there
rather than had to be able to click</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8612-3
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:15.437

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8616-0
01:25:19.517 --> 01:25:24.957
<v Ricky Horton>What do you think they're going to call
on? I'm not even. I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8633-0
01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:34.761
<v Ricky Horton>If you you can also look it from label
group on the left and it'll stay on check</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8633-1
01:25:34.761 --> 01:25:37.717
<v Ricky Horton>over there so you don't have to scroll up
in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8641-0
01:25:47.157 --> 01:25:51.672
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna just drop that.
It's like I I got some second scroll a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8641-1
01:25:51.672 --> 01:25:52.437
<v Ricky Horton>little bit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8663-0
01:26:07.237 --> 01:26:10.438
<v Ricky Horton>Looking very fast today,
the program's not shutting down.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8663-1
01:26:10.438 --> 01:26:13.308
<v Ricky Horton>That's good.
I told you I was trying to be the same</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8663-2

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8664-0
01:26:17.317 --> 01:26:17.557
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8669-0
01:26:23.477 --> 01:26:27.037
<v Ricky Horton>I take priority in my ability to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8699-0
01:26:31.397 --> 01:26:36.600
<v Ricky Horton>How many reprogramming they've ever given
me? It's been, let me see,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8699-1
01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:42.029
<v Ricky Horton>just something I'm going to get at it and
that's what I can do with it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8699-2
01:26:42.029 --> 01:26:47.157
<v Ricky Horton>Land tech is one that I have not been
able to. I know it very well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8710-0
01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:52.086
<v Ricky Horton>But I hate that program. Yeah,
I've almost said that's very, I would say.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8710-1
01:26:52.086 --> 01:26:56.655
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm gonna use the restaurant real

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8710-2
01:26:56.655 --> 01:26:57.317
<v Ricky Horton>fish today.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8713-0
01:26:58.317 --> 01:27:02.157
<v Ricky Horton>One thing I have a certain level I have
migrated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8743-0
01:27:18.957 --> 01:27:25.661
<v Ricky Horton>So have you heard or are you aware that
the goal is to have all estimated for all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8743-1
01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:29.503
<v Ricky Horton>facilities be in Phoenix?
Have you heard that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8743-2
01:27:29.503 --> 01:27:33.837
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's the goal,
the way I understand it, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8744-0
01:27:34.997 --> 01:27:35.157
<v Ricky Horton>Well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8770-0
01:27:36.237 --> 01:27:39.630
<v Ricky Horton>I don't can't really tell them if some
people are,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8770-1
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:44.752
<v Ricky Horton>but it looks like there's 7 or 12.
Some might be panel shops and there might</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8770-2
01:27:44.752 --> 01:27:48.877
<v Ricky Horton>be a when you say Phoenix,
you mean between here and Gilbert?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8785-0
01:27:50.237 --> 01:27:54.257
<v Ricky Horton>Sure. Gilbert. OK, Morgan Gilbert.
Gilbert,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8785-1
01:27:54.257 --> 01:27:59.557
<v Ricky Horton>that is run by a guy in Denver as they
roll up to Denver.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8828-0
01:28:01.597 --> 01:28:06.901
<v Ricky Horton>Seems like the lead estimators in there.
This is what I've heard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8828-1
01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:12.768
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't been verified any issue.
The facility in Great Falls is empty.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8828-2
01:28:12.768 --> 01:28:16.786
<v Ricky Horton>There's like 25,
000 square feet overhead cranes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8828-3
01:28:16.786 --> 01:28:19.037
<v Ricky Horton>but there's hardly any work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8837-0
01:28:20.517 --> 01:28:24.237
<v Ricky Horton>The selling loading load field is oil
field skids.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8856-0
01:28:26.237 --> 01:28:33.018
<v Ricky Horton>They're doing a lot of this.
I'm researching hard,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8856-1
01:28:33.018 --> 01:28:40.597
<v Ricky Horton>trying to read people that wrote trip
reports, you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8867-0
01:28:42.477 --> 01:28:48.437
<v Ricky Horton>Anyway, place in Casper.
I have no idea what they did do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8888-0
01:28:50.557 --> 01:28:53.037
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I've been trying to pull data from these.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8888-1
01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:55.569
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
trying to pull data from these facilities.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8888-2
01:28:55.569 --> 01:28:58.877
<v Ricky Horton>Like who's been there? What do they got?
What are they good at?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8920-0
01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:07.505
<v Ricky Horton>One of the jobs we want me to do is where
you know different parts of the projects.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8920-1
01:29:07.505 --> 01:29:14.700
<v Ricky Horton>I go, then I need to scale the jobs.
I know I need to like say something that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8920-2
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.837
<v Ricky Horton>I can see that so I can see their.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8954-0
01:29:18.157 --> 01:29:24.115
<v Ricky Horton>I now know what we can do here.
I'm actually a little surprised. No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8954-1
01:29:24.115 --> 01:29:28.518
<v Ricky Horton>it's like this place.
They have a little shopping.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8954-2
01:29:28.518 --> 01:29:34.131
<v Ricky Horton>It's like it's metals,
20 guys in it and and even besides pills,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8954-3
01:29:34.131 --> 01:29:36.117
<v Ricky Horton>they got a little tiny.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8996-0
01:29:36.397 --> 01:29:40.096
<v Ricky Horton>Council chair,
10 foot press break and they do a few</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8996-1
01:29:40.096 --> 01:29:45.679
<v Ricky Horton>stairs here and there and they got this
little invitation game line to do their</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8996-2
01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:51.123
<v Ricky Horton>stair springers on and they're not really
set up to do structural like calls,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/8996-3
01:29:51.123 --> 01:29:53.357
<v Ricky Horton>but that's why he's he's saying.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9031-0
01:29:53.437 --> 01:29:56.336
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we'd be saying out loud and buy a house.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9031-1
01:29:56.336 --> 01:29:59.421
<v Ricky Horton>OK, well,
doesn't the company own a facility that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9031-2
01:29:59.421 --> 01:30:02.629
<v Ricky Horton>does do those?
I think they're trying to get to the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9031-3
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:07.009
<v Ricky Horton>point to where they're doing,
want to do everything in house and we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9031-4
01:30:07.009 --> 01:30:09.477
<v Ricky Horton>good to the Jordan has done it in house.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9067-0
01:30:09.677 --> 01:30:14.335
<v Ricky Horton>Then they need to say one of these shops
I've been with these states. They do it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9067-1
01:30:14.335 --> 01:30:16.834
<v Ricky Horton>OK,

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9067-2
01:30:16.834 --> 01:30:20.470
<v Ricky Horton>same very similar thing.
They just want me to determine where's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9067-3
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:24.788
<v Ricky Horton>the best and and if they can't find a
facility that we own that doesn't the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9067-4
01:30:24.788 --> 01:30:27.117
<v Ricky Horton>best, they want me to give them ideas on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9103-0
01:30:27.397 --> 01:30:32.500
<v Ricky Horton>Where we can buy it out? OK,

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9103-1

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9311-3
01:32:27.313 --> 01:32:29.557
<v Ricky Horton>they only lasted a year or two.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9314-0
01:32:29.957 --> 01:32:33.317
<v Ricky Horton>When I ever been there, they said.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9327-0
01:32:37.317 --> 01:32:42.517
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, that's better. At least, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9345-0
01:32:43.517 --> 01:32:48.061
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause they got nothing. OK,

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9345-1
01:32:48.061 --> 01:32:50.237
<v Ricky Horton>everybody will label their mental.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9356-0
01:32:50.877 --> 01:32:56.455
<v Ricky Horton>I used to get really bad because I didn't
do that. Well, that's not my example.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9356-1
01:32:56.455 --> 01:32:58.757
<v Ricky Horton>Two good work done. Three people.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9374-0
01:33:02.157 --> 01:33:06.734
<v Ricky Horton>But as far as the shop,
the way it's set up is really good. Yes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9374-1

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9408-0
01:33:16.477 --> 01:33:22.828
<v Ricky Horton>They have to be one competitions between
each other. Hundreds of beams,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9408-1
01:33:22.828 --> 01:33:27.768
<v Ricky Horton>hundreds of columns means like 34500
beams a day. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9408-2
01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:32.797
<v Ricky Horton>that's actually started to turn steel
fast facility and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9436-0
01:33:34.397 --> 01:33:44.135
<v Ricky Horton>I was literally moving the whole time
over there. They had PDL theme lines, so,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9436-1
01:33:44.135 --> 01:33:49.978
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah, so.
So I've always been very heavy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9436-2
01:33:49.978 --> 01:33:54.117
<v Ricky Horton>So are you and just got the brand.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9465-0
01:33:54.237 --> 01:34:01.989
<v Ricky Horton>They've got 3 beam lines and then a cobra.
So they they were telling me their best</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9465-1
01:34:01.989 --> 01:34:06.005
<v Ricky Horton>week.
They're pumping out 800 tons and the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9465-2
01:34:06.005 --> 01:34:10.208
<v Ricky Horton>structure will we have to do that
equipment,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9465-3
01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:13.757
<v Ricky Horton>but the advocating house is they sell.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9495-0
01:34:13.877 --> 01:34:18.415
<v Ricky Horton>Think of things about material and it's
not a system.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9495-1
01:34:18.415 --> 01:34:24.886
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say you got to have for every
machine you got to operate and you don't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9495-2
01:34:24.886 --> 01:34:29.928
<v Ricky Horton>have to do that.
They have to move the material themselves.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9495-3
01:34:29.928 --> 01:34:31.357
<v Ricky Horton>That's a problem.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9509-0
01:34:31.357 --> 01:34:39.483
<v Ricky Horton>I wonder how many tons of Valley consumes
per month. Yeah, well, the question is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9509-1
01:34:39.483 --> 01:34:42.357
<v Ricky Horton>do all these shops stay busy?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9530-0
01:34:44.877 --> 01:34:50.604
<v Ricky Horton>I have your Phoenix is well,
I think Phoenix Phoenix is expanding</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9530-1
01:34:50.604 --> 01:34:56.419
<v Ricky Horton>because the semi con has been talking a
bunch of money here. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9530-2
01:34:56.419 --> 01:34:59.717
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's that's a temporary thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9533-0
01:35:01.917 --> 01:35:04.277
<v Ricky Horton>Just one data on little bit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9536-0
01:35:14.837 --> 01:35:14.997

01:35:19.117 --> 01:35:24.237
<v Ricky Horton>Where is that? I was in Arkansas.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9548-0

<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9572-0
01:35:30.797 --> 01:35:40.746
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I mean,
I only changed over the load,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9572-1
01:35:40.746 --> 01:35:47.077
<v Ricky Horton>so I mean I keep waiting to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9580-0
01:36:12.957 --> 01:36:17.117
<v Ricky Horton>It won't work since we're already in my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9581-0
01:36:21.637 --> 01:36:21.997
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9583-0
01:36:34.237 --> 01:36:34.357
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9599-0
01:36:53.277 --> 01:36:59.441
<v Ricky Horton>So they'd like to figure out where to
build a facility that can do hiring for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9599-1
01:36:59.441 --> 01:36:59.837
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9613-0
01:37:02.877 --> 01:37:08.161
<v Ricky Horton>I'd be happy about that too.
Right around the corner of your house.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9613-1
01:37:08.161 --> 01:37:14.377
<v Ricky Horton>Is that what you're trying to say? Yeah,
San Tan Valley too. Oh, that's a joke.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9613-2
01:37:14.377 --> 01:37:17.797
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
I got a pretty good backyard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9621-0
01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:27.917
<v Ricky Horton>And it's just having it spread out like
certainly just creates other issues.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9637-0
01:37:31.837 --> 01:37:36.413

<v Ricky Horton>it's in the year or not.
It should be worse.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9637-2
01:37:40.025 --> 01:37:43.237
<v Ricky Horton>You probably can leave this. Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9645-0
01:37:44.317 --> 01:37:48.277
<v Ricky Horton>They don't seem to want to spend a lot of
money, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9661-0
01:37:50.317 --> 01:37:59.317
<v Ricky Horton>Which can't like the places around in
this area because of panel shot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9677-0
01:38:04.957 --> 01:38:09.467
<v Ricky Horton>If you look at people's signature files,
you'll see they're the three places that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9677-1
01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:10.677
<v Ricky Horton>they have 3 audiences.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9678-0
01:38:13.277 --> 01:38:14.837
<v Ricky Horton>Open, stand on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9719-0
01:38:17.357 --> 01:38:24.359
<v Ricky Horton>That weld around one leg laying. Yeah,
that will be better,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9719-1
01:38:24.359 --> 01:38:30.778
<v Ricky Horton>but all they told you they really want
the less, less.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9719-2
01:38:30.778 --> 01:38:37.197
<v Ricky Horton>They shouldn't use those some other hours
going to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9750-0
01:38:37.277 --> 01:38:44.257
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but it doesn't use it.
So unless you put time in the labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9750-1
01:38:44.257 --> 01:38:51.667
<v Ricky Horton>standards from these other fields,
it's it's gonna be easy to put it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9750-2
01:38:51.667 --> 01:38:54.997
<v Ricky Horton>wherever you want to be really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9772-0
01:39:00.957 --> 01:39:05.726
<v Ricky Horton>Some guys have left, you know,
the rest of my sales team,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9772-1
01:39:05.726 --> 01:39:10.496
<v Ricky Horton>but I had a bunch of sales wise and some
operations guys.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9772-2
01:39:10.496 --> 01:39:14.197
<v Ricky Horton>They've already appended 50 million in
work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9773-0
01:39:16.957 --> 01:39:18.837
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have facility either.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9785-0
01:39:23.997 --> 01:39:31.037
<v Ricky Horton>Data center skids was 40 million and a
bunch of barges was 10 million.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9824-0
01:39:34.037 --> 01:39:40.494
<v Ricky Horton>But this was work we used to do at K-wood,
Steelwood, uh, the skills are integration.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9824-1
01:39:40.494 --> 01:39:43.948
<v Ricky Horton>So steel is,
steel is the most of these jobs,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9824-2
01:39:43.948 --> 01:39:48.604
<v Ricky Horton>obviously the steel.
What you're really selling are pumps and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9824-3
01:39:48.604 --> 01:39:51.157
<v Ricky Horton>motors and valves and instruments.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9832-0
01:39:52.117 --> 01:39:54.877
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I wanted. It's still like 15%.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9835-0
01:40:00.037 --> 01:40:02.357

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9863-1
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:12.828
<v Ricky Horton>No electrical, you know,
if it's certified,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9863-2
01:40:12.828 --> 01:40:15.957
<v Ricky Horton>you know it's just basic stuff. Yeah, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9887-0
01:40:16.957 --> 01:40:25.759
<v Ricky Horton>So if you're burned on the way above the
on the well, your holes, the cut,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9887-1

<v Ricky Horton>excuse me, the punch and drill.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9905-0
01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:36.608
<v Ricky Horton>They we need to go look at that.
So go up to maintenance,</v>

01:40:36.608 --> 01:40:40.677
<v Ricky Horton>estimating later maintenance and punch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9915-0
01:40:44.557 --> 01:40:50.197
<v Ricky Horton>And go to the drop down at the top,
the touch pipe maintenance.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9968-0
01:40:51.757 --> 01:40:57.993
<v Ricky Horton>And then where do you want holes for the
cycle will be basically cut for the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9968-1
01:40:57.993 --> 01:41:01.719
<v Ricky Horton>processing basically.
So they just change it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9968-2
01:41:01.719 --> 01:41:07.388
<v Ricky Horton>Do they even have punches here to punch
holes? I didn't see any much.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/9968-3
01:41:07.388 --> 01:41:11.357
<v Ricky Horton>I need to change that terminology.
They got cut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10018-0
01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:17.176
<v Ricky Horton>Drill. It might be a thermal process.
It's they they need to say whole method</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10018-1
01:41:17.176 --> 01:41:21.130
<v Ricky Horton>number one,
whole method number two and then it lets</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10018-2
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:26.278
<v Ricky Horton>you pick what you want. So yeah,
their terminology is all in here or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10018-3
01:41:26.278 --> 01:41:28.517
<v Ricky Horton>should they need to change it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10051-0
01:41:28.637 --> 01:41:33.120
<v Ricky Horton>I guess people so screwed up on that all
of them that are startling to be like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10051-1
01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.035
<v Ricky Horton>I don't punch anything.
Why are we using the punch?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10051-2
01:41:36.035 --> 01:41:37.997
<v Ricky Horton>We need to use the drill. I'm like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10069-0
01:41:39.037 --> 01:41:44.718
<v Ricky Horton>It's not saying you have to literally
function, so they go to drill as well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10069-1
01:41:44.718 --> 01:41:48.997
<v Ricky Horton>good maintenance,
estimating labor maintenance and drill.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10082-0
01:41:52.237 --> 01:41:56.957
<v Ricky Horton>Same deal drop down at the top and drill
type maintenance and change those.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10094-0
01:41:58.757 --> 01:42:05.001
<v Ricky Horton>What are you going to change it to?
It's all hard. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10094-1
01:42:05.001 --> 01:42:08.397
<v Ricky Horton>So punching in is not hard. OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10096-0
01:42:10.117 --> 01:42:10.357
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10098-0
01:42:12.477 --> 01:42:13.317
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10107-0
01:42:14.317 --> 01:42:18.437
<v Ricky Horton>This is ****. Maybe on here.
I think we've got it right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10127-0
01:42:20.397 --> 01:42:24.618
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they don't show up for their training.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10127-1
01:42:24.618 --> 01:42:32.310
<v Ricky Horton>It was yesterday. Save it to me. Oh yeah,
afternoon is first meeting mornings for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10127-2
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:33.717
<v Ricky Horton>production and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10159-0
01:42:35.197 --> 01:42:41.706
<v Ricky Horton>So, so then you go also to maintenance,
we're good. We're yeah, labor groups,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10159-1
01:42:41.706 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Ricky Horton>you're back to labor groups,
maintenance estimating labor,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10159-2
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:48.717
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance labor groups.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10186-0
01:42:50.637 --> 01:42:56.157
<v Ricky Horton>Go to the drop down at the top.
Labor group maintenance and miscellaneous</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10186-1
01:42:56.157 --> 01:42:59.961
<v Ricky Horton>labor groups.
So here's other places where that is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10186-2
01:42:59.961 --> 01:43:04.437
<v Ricky Horton>going to be said clean goes with clean.
Sure that it works.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10193-0
01:43:10.757 --> 01:43:14.037
<v Ricky Horton>Oops, probably not being used, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10202-0
01:43:15.517 --> 01:43:20.917
<v Ricky Horton>You came with splice times with the labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10264-0
01:43:26.397 --> 01:43:31.573
<v Ricky Horton>I think it'd be 12 if it's splicing the
pieces together. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10264-1
01:43:31.573 --> 01:43:38.392
<v Ricky Horton>it's something to prep for the field for
both the spice. So they'll prep the shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10264-2
01:43:38.392 --> 01:43:42.417
<v Ricky Horton>They'll make sure the beef might not just
spice.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10264-3
01:43:42.417 --> 01:43:46.197
<v Ricky Horton>They'll have bolts a lot of times on the
end.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10295-0
01:43:46.237 --> 01:43:50.997
<v Ricky Horton>Good maintenance estimating.
I'll show you where it is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10295-1
01:43:50.997 --> 01:43:57.202
<v Ricky Horton>So you can see it really better.
We're going to come right back to labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10295-2
01:43:57.202 --> 01:44:02.557
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance, splice, you know,
column splices so you can on a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10340-0
01:44:02.637 --> 01:44:08.820
<v Ricky Horton>Labor code you can say use this splice.
It's not used by default and it's just a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10340-1
01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.637
<v Ricky Horton>lot of hours.
So most people don't use this. Yes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10340-2
01:44:12.637 --> 01:44:18.820
<v Ricky Horton>they don't put any material themselves
and they don't put labor to it with labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10340-3
01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:21.797
<v Ricky Horton>codes. Most people don't use this, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10377-0
01:44:21.917 --> 01:44:27.070
<v Ricky Horton>There it is. If it's there, why not?
It just doesn't give you a breakdown of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10377-1
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:32.557
<v Ricky Horton>what it is. Is that kind of is that holes?
Is that is that actually putting it on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10377-2
01:44:32.557 --> 01:44:36.907
<v Ricky Horton>there or what is it's like it just
doesn't give you a breakdown.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10377-3
01:44:36.907 --> 01:44:39.517
<v Ricky Horton>So let's be cleaned up not using it so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10378-0
01:44:50.757 --> 01:44:51.237
<v Ricky Horton>Hey.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10390-0
01:44:53.277 --> 01:44:59.849
<v Ricky Horton>I I think we put it under clean.
We do not. I think we had a clean man,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10390-1
01:44:59.849 --> 01:45:00.397
<v Ricky Horton>right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10426-0
01:45:04.997 --> 01:45:09.520
<v Ricky Horton>So the manual labor time that gives that
hours per fee field.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10426-1
01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:15.575
<v Ricky Horton>So which I really kind of hate that field
because it gives people too much leeway,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10426-2
01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:20.317
<v Ricky Horton>but it's used too much,
but what do you want me to do with that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10456-0
01:45:21.677 --> 01:45:28.255
<v Ricky Horton>I say I'm keeping it in other just
because I know when somebody's and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10456-1
01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:33.166
<v Ricky Horton>there's not way,
then it at least ask the question. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10456-2
01:45:33.166 --> 01:45:37.376
<v Ricky Horton>cool.
I think we should have everything ordered</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10456-3
01:45:37.376 --> 01:45:38.517
<v Ricky Horton>in the right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10463-0
01:45:38.797 --> 01:45:42.117
<v Ricky Horton>So you can probably get back and delete
the other ones now and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10489-0
01:45:43.277 --> 01:45:47.814
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I'm all, well,
we know what this is today.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10489-1
01:45:47.814 --> 01:45:53.740
<v Ricky Horton>Always thinking again.
I don't think about 9:45 in the mornings</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10489-2
01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:58.277
<v Ricky Horton>when I start thinking about my dear real
hearts.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10493-0
01:45:58.397 --> 01:46:02.597
<v Ricky Horton>And it's so much salad to return.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10495-0
01:46:08.477 --> 01:46:09.197
<v Ricky Horton>Perfect.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10496-0
01:46:13.517 --> 01:46:13.717
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10497-0
01:46:17.157 --> 01:46:17.397
<v Ricky Horton>.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10516-0
01:46:21.877 --> 01:46:35.797
<v Ricky Horton>If it's used somewhere,
I think because this is for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10522-0
01:46:37.197 --> 01:46:40.357
<v Ricky Horton>So that's been up for her T Morris.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10523-0
01:46:42.117 --> 01:46:42.237
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10556-0
01:46:49.837 --> 01:46:54.560
<v Ricky Horton>Labor time.
We're trying to get the other facilities</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10556-1
01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.639
<v Ricky Horton>the same thing.
Somebody's kind of gone through with the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10556-2
01:46:59.639 --> 01:47:03.827
<v Ricky Horton>people.
I hear the local facility can be quite</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10556-3
01:47:03.827 --> 01:47:05.877
<v Ricky Horton>busy doing pipe skills.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10571-0
01:47:07.277 --> 01:47:10.693
<v Ricky Horton>I think there is. Yeah,
that was going to Camber.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10571-1
01:47:10.693 --> 01:47:14.997
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want that in Camber?
Press button where you want to be?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10623-0
01:47:17.677 --> 01:47:21.781
<v Ricky Horton>It's good.
Cameras probably has to keep there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10623-1
01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:26.060
<v Ricky Horton>Honestly,
the camera time just shy of the pencil</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10623-2
01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:31.648
<v Ricky Horton>anybody never use it.
So because it looks like it's a flat time</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10623-3
01:47:31.648 --> 01:47:37.237
<v Ricky Horton>right now and actually we adjusted a
little bit better because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10652-0
01:47:37.357 --> 01:47:43.064
<v Ricky Horton>Used to be dynamically found and most of
our camera people are taking more than</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10652-1
01:47:43.064 --> 01:47:46.988
<v Ricky Horton>three hours.
So if it's if it's anything outside of my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10652-2
01:47:46.988 --> 01:47:50.627
<v Ricky Horton>machine,
that's when it would be over because then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10652-3
01:47:50.627 --> 01:47:52.197
<v Ricky Horton>he can bring it, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10664-0
01:47:52.877 --> 01:47:58.268
<v Ricky Horton>So the two hours is probably something
Mark and then two hours you all set. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10664-1
01:47:58.268 --> 01:48:00.357
<v Ricky Horton>cool, because I would say that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10688-0
01:48:01.677 --> 01:48:07.817
<v Ricky Horton>2025 right in the three years,
14 new jobs and you got on camera machine</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10688-1
01:48:07.817 --> 01:48:13.957
<v Ricky Horton>out there collecting dust and stuff.
It's a pain. What about man flight?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10691-0
01:48:15.477 --> 01:48:19.237
<v Ricky Horton>Press break. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10695-0
01:48:20.317 --> 01:48:21.237
<v Ricky Horton>That one probably.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10721-0
01:48:23.957 --> 01:48:31.926
<v Ricky Horton>Is that just consider processing in
general in in in terminology? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10721-1
01:48:31.926 --> 01:48:41.225
<v Ricky Horton>this one would probably be more under fit
just because they're forming would be fit</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10721-2
01:48:41.225 --> 01:48:41.557
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10731-0
01:48:41.837 --> 01:48:47.157
<v Ricky Horton>No, I don't need. I don't know.
We should not be in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10767-0
01:48:48.957 --> 01:48:53.989
<v Ricky Horton>It's on a certain entity, yeah.
Bending is definitely to me, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10767-1
01:48:53.989 --> 01:48:59.446
<v Ricky Horton>and and sometimes I can argue whether
bending and rolling is the same thing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10767-2
01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:05.117
<v Ricky Horton>but no, no, they're totally different.
The theory is a little bit similar, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10771-0
01:49:05.317 --> 01:49:07.837
<v Ricky Horton>like different as well. I really like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10809-0
01:49:08.877 --> 01:49:13.266
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
we've also put we've put restorate time</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10809-1
01:49:13.266 --> 01:49:18.896
<v Ricky Horton>in handling too,
really is possibly handling to play after</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10809-2
01:49:18.896 --> 01:49:25.957
<v Ricky Horton>it's been processed and a lot of times I
mean depending upon the project.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10857-0
01:49:26.157 --> 01:49:29.611
<v Ricky Horton>You're like,
that's the extension you'll if you want</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10857-1
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:34.630
<v Ricky Horton>it to restructure or welded together,
I think it's what you got there. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10857-2
01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:38.932
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's it's no animal. No, I mean,
we can keep it that way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10857-3
01:49:38.932 --> 01:49:42.517
<v Ricky Horton>It's an estimate extra anyways. And yeah,
that's just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10873-0
01:49:42.637 --> 01:49:49.825
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna be another area where we
release it per handling cut fit well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10873-1
01:49:49.825 --> 01:49:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>right? So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10914-0
01:49:51.757 --> 01:49:58.134
<v Ricky Horton>You still have visibility to the time,
regardless of type and label. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10914-1
01:49:58.134 --> 01:50:05.361
<v Ricky Horton>you still have visibility if you want to,
yeah. But yeah, if you run a report later,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10914-2
01:50:05.361 --> 01:50:07.317
<v Ricky Horton>this is cut to show up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10970-0
01:50:07.917 --> 01:50:11.763
<v Ricky Horton>It's not. No,
that was still up in a separate category,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10970-1
01:50:11.763 --> 01:50:15.129
<v Ricky Horton>but it'll still be in the total amount of
hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10970-2
01:50:15.129 --> 01:50:19.800
<v Ricky Horton>And then from there that's the
fabrication shop project managers is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10970-3
01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:23.509
<v Ricky Horton>fresh enough.
I'm going to direct my guys to put this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/10970-4
01:50:23.509 --> 01:50:27.837
<v Ricky Horton>towards handling because we took the time
for this and put it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11003-0
01:50:27.917 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Ricky Horton>Here or this is going to go to fit for
tracking purposes and then you'll be with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11003-1
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:38.382
<v Ricky Horton>the operator and you have four hours to
break to play.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11003-2
01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:43.077
<v Ricky Horton>This is your and and then in time
tracking you'll add nulls.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11023-0
01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:49.010
<v Ricky Horton>Break press operation,
handling and then we can see that like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11023-1
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:52.700
<v Ricky Horton>you got to cut. Well,
if you have a category,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11023-2
01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:58.637
<v Ricky Horton>so handling that that will allow the bird.
I got there only one business.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11064-0
01:50:59.117 --> 01:51:03.141
<v Ricky Horton>So you can take, OK,
that's where you put your banding things</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11064-1
01:51:03.141 --> 01:51:08.010
<v Ricky Horton>like there's others that you don't pay in
the postal buckets, right? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11064-2
01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:12.683
<v Ricky Horton>that's what that's what I'll say.
I think I'm pretty much using kind of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11064-3
01:51:12.683 --> 01:51:13.917
<v Ricky Horton>like all processes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11083-0
01:51:14.197 --> 01:51:19.517
<v Ricky Horton>Alls and calves and OK, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11112-0
01:51:20.557 --> 01:51:24.107
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I hated that.
We used to have a category fab and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11112-1
01:51:24.107 --> 01:51:29.142
<v Ricky Horton>everybody put everything. Oh yeah,
I'm sure they did. Yeah. And it was, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11112-2
01:51:29.142 --> 01:51:32.757
<v Ricky Horton>Then we went to fit up and well,
that became confusing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11113-0
01:51:33.837 --> 01:51:33.957
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11116-0
01:51:35.357 --> 01:51:37.517
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it depends on how you're going to shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11127-0
01:51:38.917 --> 01:51:44.222
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to know,
our fitters could weld and our welders</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11127-1
01:51:44.222 --> 01:51:45.637
<v Ricky Horton>could, yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11131-0
01:51:49.837 --> 01:51:52.157
<v Ricky Horton>As we moved away from that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11175-0
01:51:53.197 --> 01:51:57.515
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
I have that move that was only called</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11175-1
01:51:57.515 --> 01:52:03.176
<v Ricky Horton>layout man, right?
I guess I'm freaked out. You want that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11175-2
01:52:03.176 --> 01:52:09.797
<v Ricky Horton>This one I don't understand.
I don't know who would stand on that in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11175-3
01:52:09.797 --> 01:52:10.277
<v Ricky Horton>this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11211-0
01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:16.073
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, dollars has a priority.
That's not something that we're going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11211-1
01:52:16.073 --> 01:52:22.367
<v Ricky Horton>track in this an extra. It's. I mean,
you just you send your assembly on the go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11211-2
01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:25.397
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have a free job on here at all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11226-0
01:52:25.597 --> 01:52:30.310
<v Ricky Horton>Right, that's that's just a weird no.
I don't think that's it's only moods.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11226-1
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:32.357
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't even look out for the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11238-0
01:52:34.317 --> 01:52:40.069
<v Ricky Horton>What does it do? OK,
it is accounting for a gallon housing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11238-1
01:52:40.069 --> 01:52:40.557
<v Ricky Horton>cost.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11274-0
01:52:41.517 --> 01:52:48.866
<v Ricky Horton>And then when this and then I would
assume that you would call these paving</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11274-1
01:52:48.866 --> 01:52:54.378
<v Ricky Horton>the system on it and this would get you
down in private.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11274-2
01:52:54.378 --> 01:52:59.117
<v Ricky Horton>So that makes sense to me and then
they're just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11299-0
01:52:59.877 --> 01:53:07.641
<v Ricky Horton>So move, we would switch to, Bob,
would you guys run a system that has</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11299-1
01:53:07.641 --> 01:53:15.077
<v Ricky Horton>galvanizing and paint over it?
I'll be a lot of green environments.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11339-0
01:53:15.877 --> 01:53:20.767
<v Ricky Horton>Marine environments. Yeah, on it.
Heavy corrosion areas.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11339-1
01:53:20.767 --> 01:53:26.087
<v Ricky Horton>They're even just down there at the top.
We made light poles,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11339-2
01:53:26.087 --> 01:53:32.437
<v Ricky Horton>the same light poles we said at 10 feet.
Sometimes the same coastal city.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11345-0
01:53:32.597 --> 01:53:35.477
<v Ricky Horton>And so they want to galvanize it,
that panel.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11346-0
01:53:36.717 --> 01:53:37.597
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11352-0
01:53:38.557 --> 01:53:42.163
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause they still want to look pretty,
they don't want that to be optimized,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11352-1
01:53:42.163 --> 01:53:42.397
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11353-0
01:53:46.637 --> 01:53:50.237
<v Ricky Horton>I think everything else is good to be
more other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11354-0
01:53:54.277 --> 01:53:55.237
<v Ricky Horton>Should be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11376-0
01:53:56.397 --> 01:54:00.736
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't get to taking the time to do
this is actually if you're going to move</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11376-1
01:54:00.736 --> 01:54:04.637
<v Ricky Horton>to more estimating in here,
this actually is going to be very helpful.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11425-0
01:54:09.437 --> 01:54:16.582
<v Ricky Horton>So what's going to happen when we change
all these categories and we try to run</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11425-1
01:54:16.582 --> 01:54:22.923
<v Ricky Horton>all estimates through here that don't
have that do or don't have these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11425-2
01:54:22.923 --> 01:54:28.997
<v Ricky Horton>categories? It's reporting all this.
So if we went to all this and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11459-0
01:54:29.197 --> 01:54:32.048
<v Ricky Horton>Change.
So it's not going to affect the labor,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11459-1
01:54:32.048 --> 01:54:35.749
<v Ricky Horton>but it'll affect the buckets that most
into that. We're not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11459-2
01:54:35.749 --> 01:54:39.754
<v Ricky Horton>It's been done in anyways.
We're not changing labor. I'm curious.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11459-3
01:54:39.754 --> 01:54:44.365
<v Ricky Horton>We're not changing labor at all.
We're just redirecting more of that labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11459-4
01:54:44.365 --> 01:54:45.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11462-0
01:54:45.597 --> 01:54:47.917
<v Ricky Horton>I still would be there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11475-0
01:54:54.317 --> 01:54:58.039
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
I hear Karam does like 4 estimates a week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11475-1
01:54:58.039 --> 01:55:01.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's about the number of the other guy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11481-0
01:55:03.117 --> 01:55:08.077
<v Ricky Horton>Hey Cortana,
the otherwise it's you need that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11505-0
01:55:14.717 --> 01:55:19.822
<v Ricky Horton>There's some others there.
I think 15 is probably what the average</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11505-1
01:55:19.822 --> 01:55:25.157
<v Ricky Horton>per piece is going to, yeah.
And then the other one's probably rural.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11540-0
01:55:26.557 --> 01:55:31.821
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure.
It may be that the labor operation will</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11540-1
01:55:31.821 --> 01:55:37.645
<v Ricky Horton>point to one and then that's the only
problem with only using the label.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11540-2
01:55:37.645 --> 01:55:40.357
<v Ricky Horton>We're not seeing the 15 or 16, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11544-0
01:55:41.517 --> 01:55:45.797
<v Ricky Horton>This one's fine. This one's fine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11566-0
01:55:48.317 --> 01:55:55.051
<v Ricky Horton>And when you kind of paint that's that's
what we want. What I said,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11566-1
01:55:55.051 --> 01:56:02.677
<v Ricky Horton>you're more bad that coping was under
burger. Do you want that under burger?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11611-0
01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:08.879
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I would. I would say so. OK,
if we're to open the house,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11611-1
01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:12.653
<v Ricky Horton>we're using the mouse C7 torch and we're
I I was just,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11611-2
01:56:12.653 --> 01:56:17.525
<v Ricky Horton>I was just kind of thinking you,
you got everything in the car is only</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11611-3
01:56:17.525 --> 01:56:22.877
<v Ricky Horton>plate and that was going to be my plan.
So I just want to make sure I see it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11612-0
01:56:22.957 --> 01:56:23.117
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11613-0
01:56:24.237 --> 01:56:26.237
<v Ricky Horton>Do you hear any ranges at all?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11638-0
01:56:35.277 --> 01:56:39.508
<v Ricky Horton>Because that's going to get money real
quick. Yes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11638-1
01:56:39.508 --> 01:56:46.394
<v Ricky Horton>we're using obviously some of the torch,
but that's truck time going to the detail</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11638-2
01:56:46.394 --> 01:56:50.957
<v Ricky Horton>department and they're going to cut the
beam the land.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11648-0
01:56:51.557 --> 01:57:00.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, all that's gonna be under there, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11659-0
01:57:02.197 --> 01:57:07.630
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, let's see which one is.
It's using good fabricated information</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11659-1
01:57:07.630 --> 01:57:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>first.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11664-0
01:57:10.397 --> 01:57:11.877
<v Ricky Horton>A good operating.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11680-0
01:57:16.757 --> 01:57:20.670
<v Ricky Horton>Yep,
I've been in operations at the bottom and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11680-1
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:25.917
<v Ricky Horton>then the coats there.
So it's usually a manual apartment rate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11707-0
01:57:27.557 --> 01:57:31.760
<v Ricky Horton>Wonder if that's what you're in the
meeting changing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11707-1
01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:37.831
<v Ricky Horton>Go to let's see what go to labor codes
and see what your like labor codes are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11707-2
01:57:37.831 --> 01:57:41.412
<v Ricky Horton>using.
I don't want to bet you it's using the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11707-3
01:57:41.412 --> 01:57:41.957
<v Ricky Horton>manual.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11714-0
01:57:50.677 --> 01:57:53.757
<v Ricky Horton>Labor maintenance, labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11721-0
01:57:54.917 --> 01:57:59.133
<v Ricky Horton>I was forget that.
So we had to sneak it into this every tab.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11721-1
01:57:59.133 --> 01:57:59.677
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11724-0
01:58:01.717 --> 01:58:03.717
<v Ricky Horton>They're gonna have a plate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11730-0
01:58:09.797 --> 01:58:12.157
<v Ricky Horton>And then just go to the Formalas tab.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11742-0
01:58:13.517 --> 01:58:19.557
<v Ricky Horton>And hover over that and it'll show you
over the formula if thickness is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11784-0
01:58:20.677 --> 01:58:24.664
<v Ricky Horton>Burn manual.
So the coats and the and the plate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11784-1
01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:30.146
<v Ricky Horton>machine are usually the exact same rate,
the exact same function.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11784-2
01:58:30.146 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Ricky Horton>So if we report it,
we report the whole thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11784-3
01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:40.197
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess the question is do you want to
use a different burn burn rate?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11786-0
01:58:40.357 --> 01:58:44.117
<v Ricky Horton>For the coats and the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11810-0
01:58:46.677 --> 01:58:54.705
<v Ricky Horton>I would definitely say so considering the
operation is gonna run a significantly</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11810-1
01:58:54.705 --> 01:59:01.644
<v Ricky Horton>faster burn rate than, yeah,
an operator out there with a hand torch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11810-2
01:59:01.644 --> 01:59:02.437
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11817-0
01:59:02.677 --> 01:59:07.804
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's pretty much it.
So let's get a look at the break.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11817-1
01:59:07.804 --> 01:59:09.757
<v Ricky Horton>It says 9 lane rate, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11819-0
01:59:15.677 --> 01:59:16.237
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11861-0
01:59:18.197 --> 01:59:24.545
<v Ricky Horton>Problem we're going to have.
So that's what the plate machine is using.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11861-1
01:59:24.545 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that's what every plate machine is using</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11861-2
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:32.834
<v Ricky Horton>right now,
which what is 76 eights of the bust</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11861-3
01:59:32.834 --> 01:59:34.157
<v Ricky Horton>out-of-the-box.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11876-0
01:59:34.437 --> 01:59:40.231
<v Ricky Horton>So I probably have 69 for the result,
but I don't know something in between</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11876-1
01:59:40.231 --> 01:59:43.357
<v Ricky Horton>there, but yeah, that's one thing we can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11880-0
01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:48.677
<v Ricky Horton>Um, in downloading this for sure I.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11921-0
01:59:49.637 --> 01:59:52.788
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
I don't know what you want to do here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11921-1
01:59:52.788 --> 01:59:56.260
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to?
We could either change the plate to a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11921-2
01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:59.733
<v Ricky Horton>different burn type,
or we can change the coding to a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11921-3
01:59:59.733 --> 02:00:02.755
<v Ricky Horton>different burn type.
Anything other than this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11921-4
02:00:02.755 --> 02:00:06.357
<v Ricky Horton>the semi and automatic is going to be
faster than this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11924-0
02:00:06.397 --> 02:00:09.477
<v Ricky Horton>Um, go to semi automatic.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11933-0
02:00:11.957 --> 02:00:15.757
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna bet that's probably more
realistic for your blade machine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11968-0
02:00:17.157 --> 02:00:22.298
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you get an automatic. It's like,
it's like super fast.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11968-1
02:00:22.298 --> 02:00:27.270
<v Ricky Horton>That might be actual everything's back.
Yeah, it might be,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11968-2
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:33.760
<v Ricky Horton>but it doesn't account for all the
movement of the hip before before the arc</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11968-3
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.277
<v Ricky Horton>starts, right. So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11970-0
02:00:36.677 --> 02:00:38.157
<v Ricky Horton>The others would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11971-0
02:00:42.117 --> 02:00:42.237
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11972-0
02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:44.597
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11976-0
02:00:56.797 --> 02:00:59.317
<v Ricky Horton>So it's oxy and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11991-0
02:01:07.397 --> 02:01:14.429
<v Ricky Horton>You just have to find the right to share
it's in the before and then we'll be able</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/11991-1
02:01:14.429 --> 02:01:15.277
<v Ricky Horton>to adjust.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12003-0
02:01:16.637 --> 02:01:23.416
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so it's 10 gauge and then it should just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12003-1
02:01:23.416 --> 02:01:28.237
<v Ricky Horton>be 15 inch, 40 inch of a minute.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12020-0
02:01:29.757 --> 02:01:38.572
<v Ricky Horton>Is this the machine that's up to the
order? Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12020-1
02:01:38.572 --> 02:01:44.397
<v Ricky Horton>quarter inch through 3/8 it'd be 110.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12047-0
02:01:45.397 --> 02:01:51.114
<v Ricky Horton>9675 inches per minute.
I don't believe they're that fast because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12047-1
02:01:51.114 --> 02:01:56.746
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think it's accounting for
everything like you mentioned.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12047-2
02:01:56.746 --> 02:02:02.637
<v Ricky Horton>It's not you know the the machine may
actually burn that fast, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12079-0
02:02:02.837 --> 02:02:08.119
<v Ricky Horton>It's not trying to move the head over
here, over here, over here. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12079-1
02:02:08.119 --> 02:02:13.035
<v Ricky Horton>I think there's, I mean,
whatever the programs that calculate this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12079-2
02:02:13.035 --> 02:02:17.437
<v Ricky Horton>take a lot of this into account,
right when you pick these.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12109-0
02:02:18.117 --> 02:02:23.672
<v Ricky Horton>Cut speeds like when you make a turn,
depending on how you program,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12109-1
02:02:23.672 --> 02:02:28.818
<v Ricky Horton>it slows the speed down the arc depending
on your cut quality.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12109-2
02:02:28.818 --> 02:02:35.517
<v Ricky Horton>Pierce times or depending on what you're
piercing, you know those drive a lot of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12113-0
02:02:36.757 --> 02:02:38.717
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12139-0
02:02:39.877 --> 02:02:47.301
<v Ricky Horton>But the guy who uses for consumables
matters a lot and 110 inches per bed for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12139-1
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:53.394
<v Ricky Horton>quarter inch right here,
that's 550 feet per hour and I'll find</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12139-2
02:02:53.394 --> 02:02:54.917
<v Ricky Horton>most people are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12173-0
02:02:55.037 --> 02:03:00.497
<v Ricky Horton>Running it,
they're going to speed by half of what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12173-1
02:03:00.497 --> 02:03:08.582
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean look and see what the what the
other speeds were for quarter inch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12173-2
02:03:08.582 --> 02:03:14.357
<v Ricky Horton>What's the semi? So automatic is 550,
what's the semi?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12189-0
02:03:14.437 --> 02:03:21.717
<v Ricky Horton>What do you guys want?
What do you do with base plates on there?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12189-1
02:03:21.717 --> 02:03:28.997
<v Ricky Horton>Base plates, base plates, cap plates,
stiffeners, gusset plates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12211-0
02:03:30.997 --> 02:03:34.916
<v Ricky Horton>So it's a small one.
It's anything over 2 inch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12211-1
02:03:34.916 --> 02:03:41.367
<v Ricky Horton>We got it next time. So you guys got this,
your boss being. It's a bottom now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12211-2
02:03:41.367 --> 02:03:44.797
<v Ricky Horton>They got nothing. It's they were too good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12242-0
02:03:46.197 --> 02:03:52.424
<v Ricky Horton>We're we're limited to 96 by 240 on that
table and you'll see those plates for all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12242-1
02:03:52.424 --> 02:03:57.300
<v Ricky Horton>40 foot and I could purchase them with a
bell burn to the whole.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12242-2
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:01.277
<v Ricky Horton>So and it was a pain trying to find an
inch and 1/4.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12269-0
02:04:02.317 --> 02:04:07.455
<v Ricky Horton>Late at 40 foot,
you have it as long back at the only foot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12269-1
02:04:07.455 --> 02:04:12.070
<v Ricky Horton>place for me.
Don't press that smooth plug and steal</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12269-2
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:17.557
<v Ricky Horton>that in Phoenix I would have always come
the clock in between.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12310-0
02:04:17.957 --> 02:04:22.412
<v Ricky Horton>They don't respond to the messages.
They can have a check semi on that for a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12310-1
02:04:22.412 --> 02:04:25.536
<v Ricky Horton>minute and see if it has to put pages for
that. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12310-2
02:04:25.536 --> 02:04:29.529
<v Ricky Horton>that's that's probably still slower than
what you're really running,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12310-3
02:04:29.529 --> 02:04:33.347
<v Ricky Horton>but right now maybe is what it's using,
but it's like super slow.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12310-4
02:04:33.347 --> 02:04:36.877
<v Ricky Horton>So that would be at least semi on that's
what you're saying.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12332-0
02:04:37.077 --> 02:04:40.157
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and we could change all this too,
right? You know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12332-1
02:04:40.157 --> 02:04:43.831
<v Ricky Horton>we could get out there and change all
these rates to make it match.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12332-2
02:04:43.831 --> 02:04:48.317
<v Ricky Horton>I don't if you if you're not really sure
where you want it to be better, then you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12379-0
02:04:49.157 --> 02:04:56.032
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if you want to like use to
say let me get what half inch would be,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12379-1
02:04:56.032 --> 02:05:00.501
<v Ricky Horton>what quarter inch would be,
what one inch would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12379-2
02:05:00.501 --> 02:05:06.173
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if that's what you want to
do or yeah, well, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12379-3
02:05:06.173 --> 02:05:08.837
<v Ricky Horton>at least we can get it. We can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12414-0
02:05:08.917 --> 02:05:14.282
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we did. Yeah.
Do you have a What do you want to change</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12414-1
02:05:14.282 --> 02:05:18.944
<v Ricky Horton>it over to Sara?
I'm not sure with Sara or probably.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12414-2
02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:25.981
<v Ricky Horton>I think Sara is at least closer than
manual. Manual is being really slow. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12414-3
02:05:25.981 --> 02:05:27.477
<v Ricky Horton>the automatic is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12447-0
02:05:27.797 --> 02:05:32.858
<v Ricky Horton>That's the problem.
That's why the feed rates. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12447-1
02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:38.301
<v Ricky Horton>it gets at least a lot closer to where
we're doing that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12447-2
02:05:38.301 --> 02:05:44.221
<v Ricky Horton>And we're only manual as the the the
coding stuff, right. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12447-3
02:05:44.221 --> 02:05:47.277
<v Ricky Horton>so while we're in the here, the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12453-0
02:05:47.677 --> 02:05:53.117
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, get back in there.
We'll we'll repoint the manual to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12456-0
02:05:54.277 --> 02:05:56.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the burn.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12471-0
02:05:59.557 --> 02:06:03.895
<v Ricky Horton>Two more down. Keep on going down. Burn.
Keep going up right there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12471-1
02:06:03.895 --> 02:06:07.277
<v Ricky Horton>So you got manually code for everything
torch, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12507-0
02:06:08.677 --> 02:06:13.975
<v Ricky Horton>Unless I send it out, yeah,
so there's a drop down at the top.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12507-1
02:06:13.975 --> 02:06:18.433
<v Ricky Horton>Burn lanes, burn tight lanes.
We'll take the manual.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12507-2
02:06:18.433 --> 02:06:25.077
<v Ricky Horton>We'll point that to where we want to go
in for your hand cokes. That would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12555-0
02:06:26.197 --> 02:06:30.754
<v Ricky Horton>We can even rename.
I like renaming these sometimes so that I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12555-1
02:06:30.754 --> 02:06:36.120
<v Ricky Horton>will then like you get some manual dash
papers or something and even the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12555-2
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.089
<v Ricky Horton>remediation.
I might change it as well because that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12555-3
02:06:40.089 --> 02:06:45.823
<v Ricky Horton>what shows in all the formulas and so
that that way you know what these rates</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12555-4
02:06:45.823 --> 02:06:46.117
<v Ricky Horton>are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12558-0
02:06:46.157 --> 02:06:48.357
<v Ricky Horton>Right, we'll have a look at it and see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12567-0
02:06:54.637 --> 02:06:59.557
<v Ricky Horton>Or do you change the rating? That's oh,
that's the manual. Got it? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12605-0
02:07:22.037 --> 02:07:27.700
<v Ricky Horton>All right. So what we'll have to do now,
then we got to get back into the labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12605-1
02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:32.727
<v Ricky Horton>case. We got to be right in trouble.
We're going to do the labor case,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12605-2
02:07:32.727 --> 02:07:37.894
<v Ricky Horton>change that formula for the cutting.
So it's supporting at the semi rate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12605-3
02:07:37.894 --> 02:07:39.877
<v Ricky Horton>rather than the manual rate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12634-0
02:07:43.797 --> 02:07:51.658
<v Ricky Horton>And so unchecked.
See if the one below it just put them</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12634-1
02:07:51.658 --> 02:07:58.397
<v Ricky Horton>around the read and we'll see if it's the
same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12638-0
02:07:58.877 --> 02:08:01.317
<v Ricky Horton>Which won't be hard to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12639-0
02:08:03.597 --> 02:08:05.237
<v Ricky Horton>You know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12644-0
02:08:08.877 --> 02:08:10.397
<v Ricky Horton>This looks like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12663-0
02:08:12.477 --> 02:08:16.230
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, we'll have to create one for Barnes,
which is no big deal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12663-1
02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:18.517
<v Ricky Horton>You can go to the drop down at the top.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12680-0
02:08:21.237 --> 02:08:27.011
<v Ricky Horton>Maintenance and then we'll find that
formula. We'll hit new.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12680-1
02:08:27.011 --> 02:08:30.797
<v Ricky Horton>We wanted to find it and just change it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12694-0
02:08:31.677 --> 02:08:39.009
<v Ricky Horton>So you have new at the bottom and then in
the edit operation formula is what you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12694-1
02:08:39.009 --> 02:08:40.277
<v Ricky Horton>want up there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12710-0
02:08:42.117 --> 02:08:46.673
<v Ricky Horton>And just see what's been Burn Man.
Get rid of that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12710-1
02:08:46.673 --> 02:08:53.157
<v Ricky Horton>You need to get rid of Burn Man COVID.
Get rid of that whole thing there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12740-0
02:08:57.517 --> 02:09:03.470
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. And then hit operations down here,
the drop down,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12740-1
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:10.381
<v Ricky Horton>there you go and get your tables and add
operation. There we go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12740-2
02:09:10.381 --> 02:09:13.677
<v Ricky Horton>So now we got there. So hit OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12782-0
02:09:13.997 --> 02:09:17.959
<v Ricky Horton>While we're in here,
will that accept that if you have else</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12782-1
02:09:17.959 --> 02:09:21.855
<v Ricky Horton>and if? Yeah, yeah,
because it's it's looking at if we can</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12782-2
02:09:21.855 --> 02:09:25.156
<v Ricky Horton>share it,
share it based off capacity and if that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12782-3
02:09:25.156 --> 02:09:28.722
<v Ricky Horton>is all zero.
So it's going to bypass all that and get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12782-4
02:09:28.722 --> 02:09:33.477
<v Ricky Horton>straight to the burn function. So OK,
so it doesn't expect an argument.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12812-0
02:09:33.757 --> 02:09:38.958
<v Ricky Horton>We put it after else. Well,
we we put it after else after the burn</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12812-1
02:09:38.958 --> 02:09:42.918
<v Ricky Horton>was in the.
So it's not it's not some of the other</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12812-2
02:09:42.918 --> 02:09:47.343
<v Ricky Horton>statements don't have an else and if at
the end of them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12812-3
02:09:47.343 --> 02:09:50.837
<v Ricky Horton>My tip it it it's it's going to be good.
OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12842-0
02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:57.064
<v Ricky Horton>Look, while we're here, see the length.
This is what I was telling you about that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12842-1
02:09:57.064 --> 02:10:02.679
<v Ricky Horton>was wrong out-of-the-box. In my opinion,
the the the length formula basically says</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12842-2
02:10:02.679 --> 02:10:06.265
<v Ricky Horton>width plus length.
That's how much burnout would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12842-3
02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:07.077
<v Ricky Horton>It's really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12874-0
02:10:07.997 --> 02:10:10.750
<v Ricky Horton>With times through late times through,
yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12874-1
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:13.686
<v Ricky Horton>you might need your chain cutting or
something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12874-2
02:10:13.686 --> 02:10:16.745
<v Ricky Horton>It's not necessarily going to be that
same thing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12874-3
02:10:16.745 --> 02:10:21.700
<v Ricky Horton>but what I typically do is I'll just put
a parenthesis around that and then just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12874-4
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:22.557
<v Ricky Horton>three times 2.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12884-0
02:10:22.957 --> 02:10:26.299
<v Ricky Horton>So the default is always cut the
perimeter.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12884-1
02:10:26.299 --> 02:10:31.237
<v Ricky Horton>Do do it at the end of the end of the end.
Yeah, now we've done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12932-0
02:10:32.557 --> 02:10:37.479
<v Ricky Horton>Say that again then.
Basically the default is cut approved.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12932-1
02:10:37.479 --> 02:10:41.992
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, if you do better,
the common cuts is fine,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12932-2
02:10:41.992 --> 02:10:47.160
<v Ricky Horton>but the default is cut approved, right?
Yeah, I would do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12932-3
02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.837
<v Ricky Horton>And like I say out-of-the-box,
I'll bet you 90% of this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-0
02:10:52.157 --> 02:10:55.901
<v Ricky Horton>In the United States that are using this
and that included that they're only</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-1
02:10:55.901 --> 02:10:59.159
<v Ricky Horton>getting with the line, yeah,
especially with what we're doing for,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-2
02:10:59.159 --> 02:11:03.098
<v Ricky Horton>we're cutting base plates and all these
small parts when we are going around the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-3
02:11:03.098 --> 02:11:06.600
<v Ricky Horton>perimeter. Does that make sense?
You might want to go ahead and change.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-4
02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.441
<v Ricky Horton>There's another two formulas here with
times length that we're going to do the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12980-5
02:11:10.441 --> 02:11:11.317
<v Ricky Horton>times too as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/12985-0
02:11:11.837 --> 02:11:14.877
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, yes,
because if you go back and use those.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13007-0
02:11:16.637 --> 02:11:21.454
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just afraid that you'll get the same
thing. Good point.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13007-1
02:11:21.454 --> 02:11:27.717
<v Ricky Horton>The weary traveler will step into our
traffic again. Yeah, it should be good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13032-0
02:11:29.237 --> 02:11:32.318
<v Ricky Horton>Since April, yeah,
it should be that that one right there at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13032-1
02:11:32.318 --> 02:11:35.702
<v Ricky Horton>least. Um, you got that one.
I guess you got both of those when we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13032-2
02:11:35.702 --> 02:11:39.641
<v Ricky Horton>added the one at the bottom, right?
You might if you if you want to take that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13032-3
02:11:39.641 --> 02:11:40.197
<v Ricky Horton>bottom one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13035-0
02:11:41.437 --> 02:11:43.197
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Go ahead.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13055-0
02:11:57.077 --> 02:12:02.559
<v Ricky Horton>You might want to move that up.
That might be you won't have to struggle</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13055-1
02:12:02.559 --> 02:12:07.516
<v Ricky Horton>when you get a fix all this.
You're going to have to change every</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13055-2
02:12:07.516 --> 02:12:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>formula.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13075-0
02:12:10.037 --> 02:12:13.899
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
So now we have all the blank rules just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13075-1
02:12:13.899 --> 02:12:21.037
<v Ricky Horton>need to be changed to that or to play the
labor case. Excuse me, right? Terminology.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13091-0
02:12:24.957 --> 02:12:29.467
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, you were changing.
You had hit me on the labor day.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13091-1
02:12:29.467 --> 02:12:30.837
<v Ricky Horton>We don't need to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13098-0
02:12:34.157 --> 02:12:38.277
<v Ricky Horton>Just click on what you want to realize.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13102-0
02:12:40.637 --> 02:12:44.157
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry, I've looked back to driver.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13104-0
02:12:53.317 --> 02:12:54.917
<v Ricky Horton>Should be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13114-0
02:13:10.197 --> 02:13:16.357
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's quite true. That's cool.
I think it'll be more accurate, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13123-0
02:13:21.997 --> 02:13:26.037
<v Ricky Horton>And I would imagine that's still going to
be slow, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13149-0
02:13:27.877 --> 02:13:31.632
<v Ricky Horton>We'll have.
We'll have worst case scenario covered.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13149-1
02:13:31.632 --> 02:13:36.832
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, actually, I don't know.
We may not be changing now because it was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13149-2
02:13:36.832 --> 02:13:41.237
<v Ricky Horton>using with the link at the very slow.
Oh yeah, there you go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13149-3
02:13:41.237 --> 02:13:43.837
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't want to sit on that with.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13163-0
02:13:43.917 --> 02:13:51.591
<v Ricky Horton>With them to be late, so I don't know.
I'll be accurate. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13163-1
02:13:51.591 --> 02:13:54.637
<v Ricky Horton>I guess or more accurate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13165-0
02:14:12.357 --> 02:14:12.477
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13168-0
02:14:14.957 --> 02:14:20.037
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, did they have any information?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13183-0
02:15:12.157 --> 02:15:18.871
<v Ricky Horton>This is why I love this,
so customers can't hold everything from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13183-1
02:15:18.871 --> 02:15:21.557
<v Ricky Horton>long believe that it's so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13190-0
02:15:25.277 --> 02:15:28.770
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
they got people on the system and don't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13190-1
02:15:28.770 --> 02:15:29.717
<v Ricky Horton>use it, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13243-0
02:16:01.677 --> 02:16:06.787
<v Ricky Horton>I know you're pulling this out into
another spreadsheet right now,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13243-1
02:16:06.787 --> 02:16:10.906
<v Ricky Horton>but if we are affecting every estimate in
the system,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13243-2
02:16:10.906 --> 02:16:17.161
<v Ricky Horton>so if you want all the estimates that are
that have been in there to be what they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13243-3
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:20.365
<v Ricky Horton>were,
we we would need the global edit on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13243-4
02:16:20.365 --> 02:16:21.357
<v Ricky Horton>better label.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13272-0
02:16:21.437 --> 02:16:25.776
<v Ricky Horton>Labor archive, yeah,
you could put labor archive one day or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13272-1
02:16:25.776 --> 02:16:29.465
<v Ricky Horton>something, so it's through it.
That's still a lot,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13272-2
02:16:29.465 --> 02:16:34.672
<v Ricky Horton>but it better change the hours,
but you may not get back and look at it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13272-3
02:16:34.672 --> 02:16:35.757
<v Ricky Horton>after the fact.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13283-0
02:16:36.397 --> 02:16:44.197
<v Ricky Horton>No, I think, I think,
I don't think this has been as fast as.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13285-0
02:16:46.117 --> 02:16:47.477
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13287-0
02:16:49.357 --> 02:16:50.997
<v Ricky Horton>So that's good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13298-0
02:16:53.117 --> 02:16:57.397
<v Ricky Horton>You need to see the lighting screens at
all. You want them in a different order.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13304-0
02:17:13.997 --> 02:17:17.237
<v Ricky Horton>Going in order of the rose to Michelle.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13311-0
02:17:22.237 --> 02:17:23.917
<v Ricky Horton>So the burn makes the cut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13313-0
02:17:25.237 --> 02:17:25.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13321-0
02:17:28.317 --> 02:17:33.077
<v Ricky Horton>Attention to my son,
so the one you already have that is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13329-0
02:17:34.077 --> 02:17:42.893
<v Ricky Horton>There's a reading about ACP's and you
said plus for the eight group.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13329-1
02:17:42.893 --> 02:17:47.877
<v Ricky Horton>I like the trend. What did you talk to?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13373-0
02:17:51.277 --> 02:17:55.390
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but you can get the database is all you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13373-1
02:17:55.390 --> 02:18:01.559
<v Ricky Horton>think. I don't have a chance to test it.
I won't forget any of this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13373-2
02:18:01.559 --> 02:18:07.907
<v Ricky Horton>I'll try messing with that for.
I'll see if we can get into it. Chris,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13373-3
02:18:07.907 --> 02:18:11.037
<v Ricky Horton>choose. Yeah. No, we shouldn't get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13384-0
02:18:11.317 --> 02:18:18.648
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna be awesome fried chicken. Yeah,
you can share the fried chicken.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13384-1
02:18:18.648 --> 02:18:26.077
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we heard for sitting in this
safety training room all day here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13418-0
02:18:28.557 --> 02:18:33.966
<v Ricky Horton>This last day of the audit, Yeah,
last day of the audit at the facility.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13418-1
02:18:33.966 --> 02:18:39.745
<v Ricky Horton>The last day of it was field. Yeah,
so that's the last three day in the field</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13418-2
02:18:39.745 --> 02:18:42.635
<v Ricky Horton>as well.
That was like just one of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13418-3
02:18:42.635 --> 02:18:44.117
<v Ricky Horton>environmental audit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13433-0
02:18:44.317 --> 02:18:48.783
<v Ricky Horton>There's an environment that's separate,
separate entity.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13433-1
02:18:48.783 --> 02:18:51.917
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I think Chris is not able to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13444-0
02:18:52.717 --> 02:18:56.837
<v Ricky Horton>We have one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13445-0
02:18:58.157 --> 02:18:58.637
<v Ricky Horton>Was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13473-0
02:19:00.517 --> 02:19:07.297
<v Ricky Horton>If he saw the auditor was digging into
something we were weak on,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13473-1
02:19:07.297 --> 02:19:14.592
<v Ricky Horton>he would take that guy down a rabbit
trail a bit of stuff that just to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13473-2
02:19:14.592 --> 02:19:15.517
<v Ricky Horton>redirect.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13511-0
02:19:15.517 --> 02:19:19.358
<v Ricky Horton>And we have to do AIC, ASME and ISM.
All those audits.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13511-1
02:19:19.358 --> 02:19:24.806
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not happy with those guys is I get an
honored one year that tell me to do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13511-2
02:19:24.806 --> 02:19:28.367
<v Ricky Horton>something. Next year,
the next honor will be like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13511-3
02:19:28.367 --> 02:19:32.907
<v Ricky Horton>why are you doing that?
It's like because your guy don't even do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13511-4
02:19:32.907 --> 02:19:33.117
<v Ricky Horton>it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13517-0
02:19:33.597 --> 02:19:37.109
<v Ricky Horton>That there is very they were very
inconsistent.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13517-1
02:19:37.109 --> 02:19:39.597
<v Ricky Horton>Why is there two other statements?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13539-0
02:19:41.037 --> 02:19:47.846
<v Ricky Horton>We could probably change one of one of
them is coming from one field,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13539-1
02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:55.434
<v Ricky Horton>one is coming from a different field.
They could, they could probably change,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13539-2
02:19:55.434 --> 02:19:57.477
<v Ricky Horton>but yeah, once other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13564-0
02:19:57.877 --> 02:20:02.213
<v Ricky Horton>No, I think it will.
It should be once pointing to that hours</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13564-1
02:20:02.213 --> 02:20:07.738
<v Ricky Horton>per piece field and then I think the
other one is coming from all of the labor</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13564-2
02:20:07.738 --> 02:20:09.557
<v Ricky Horton>operations that say other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13586-0
02:20:11.077 --> 02:20:16.148
<v Ricky Horton>We'll get it solid and if you want to do,
we just have to change the name of one so</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13586-1
02:20:16.148 --> 02:20:18.926
<v Ricky Horton>we know which label is which.
It's all right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13586-2
02:20:18.926 --> 02:20:20.677
<v Ricky Horton>The biggest thing I'm having.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13592-0
02:20:23.037 --> 02:20:26.997
<v Ricky Horton>You master this sense of grips,
our beliefs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13611-0
02:20:28.877 --> 02:20:33.354
<v Ricky Horton>How can you tell me I can't have 11?
Tell me where there's an 11 or two.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13611-1
02:20:33.354 --> 02:20:36.237
<v Ricky Horton>I think the actual prescription was
obviously.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13612-0
02:20:37.837 --> 02:20:39.637
<v Ricky Horton>And yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13614-0
02:20:45.837 --> 02:20:53.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, that's why I can do both.
It's just love and have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13615-0
02:20:54.797 --> 02:20:54.917
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13619-0
02:20:57.597 --> 02:21:00.117
<v Ricky Horton>She got me very appointed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13620-0
02:21:02.717 --> 02:21:02.997
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13626-0
02:21:14.917 --> 02:21:16.357
<v Ricky Horton>So it might be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13627-0
02:21:21.237 --> 02:21:23.157
<v Ricky Horton>Or instead of 30 candidates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13628-0
02:21:24.637 --> 02:21:25.397
<v Ricky Horton>Huge.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13635-0
02:21:30.157 --> 02:21:33.441
<v Ricky Horton>It definitely did increase my leg.
Increase what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13635-1
02:21:33.441 --> 02:21:35.477
<v Ricky Horton>Definitely did increase my leg.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13650-0
02:21:36.717 --> 02:21:42.506
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, yeah. What was it? Yeah,
it was 148 where we also have it in K to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13650-1
02:21:42.506 --> 02:21:42.837
<v Ricky Horton>the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13654-0
02:21:47.157 --> 02:21:49.437
<v Ricky Horton>So which was?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13657-0
02:21:51.717 --> 02:21:51.877
<v Ricky Horton>close.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13660-0
02:21:52.957 --> 02:21:54.517
<v Ricky Horton>close to 100 hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13663-0
02:22:08.317 --> 02:22:09.157
<v Ricky Horton>On me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13665-0
02:22:21.197 --> 02:22:24.517
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm just going to SP3 and see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13667-0
02:22:29.197 --> 02:22:29.317
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13668-0
02:22:36.757 --> 02:22:37.557
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13669-0
02:22:44.237 --> 02:22:44.357
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13675-0
02:23:03.357 --> 02:23:05.517
<v Ricky Horton>Purple feels super expensive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13704-0
02:23:06.437 --> 02:23:10.770
<v Ricky Horton>Ridiculous.
Nice part is is we just figured out that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13704-1
02:23:10.770 --> 02:23:17.312
<v Ricky Horton>since we're not pushing our projects over
and trying to sync all of our budgets</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13704-2
02:23:17.312 --> 02:23:21.237
<v Ricky Horton>with it,
we can now be in the minimum planning.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13741-0
02:23:21.957 --> 02:23:28.759
<v Ricky Horton>And still do small estimates and
proposals and changes and stuff inside of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13741-1
02:23:28.759 --> 02:23:33.113
<v Ricky Horton>this.
Some of the people are using this system,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13741-2
02:23:33.113 --> 02:23:37.104
<v Ricky Horton>but for a while there was based on
roading,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13741-3
02:23:37.104 --> 02:23:41.277
<v Ricky Horton>so we were almost speaking like serious
cash.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13754-0
02:23:41.357 --> 02:23:49.524
<v Ricky Horton>These would force proposals and stuff.
Yeah, we could tackle and get rid of,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13754-1
02:23:49.524 --> 02:23:53.237
<v Ricky Horton>yeah. So going on the end, so that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13799-0
02:23:54.637 --> 02:23:57.925
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
to my understanding that they're phasing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13799-1
02:23:57.925 --> 02:24:01.073
<v Ricky Horton>this out.
So if you don't have access to it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13799-2
02:24:01.073 --> 02:24:04.291
<v Ricky Horton>the training on the system. Oh,
so don't you?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13799-3
02:24:04.291 --> 02:24:09.817
<v Ricky Horton>So what is the new system basically?
The new system is to my understanding how</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13799-4
02:24:09.817 --> 02:24:10.517
<v Ricky Horton>you build.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13828-0
02:24:10.877 --> 02:24:16.292
<v Ricky Horton>That's going to be whether they're doing
bids in and then tentative proposals</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13828-1
02:24:16.292 --> 02:24:21.845
<v Ricky Horton>until 100% of estimating is moved into
Tekla and we can generate proposals from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13828-2
02:24:21.845 --> 02:24:26.219
<v Ricky Horton>everything from here.
So it sounds like it's going to be Tekla</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13828-3
02:24:26.219 --> 02:24:27.677
<v Ricky Horton>heavy bid heavy work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13861-0
02:24:29.397 --> 02:24:33.118
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they do not want us to be continuing on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13861-1
02:24:33.118 --> 02:24:36.838
<v Ricky Horton>this,
but I mean up until like last week this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13861-2
02:24:36.838 --> 02:24:42.662
<v Ricky Horton>Austin Revolution Industrial.
So they clearly have made changes in here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13861-3
02:24:42.662 --> 02:24:43.957
<v Ricky Horton>and now this is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13892-0
02:24:44.317 --> 02:24:49.737
<v Ricky Horton>This is actually recycling and I think if
I generate a proposal now,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13892-1
02:24:49.737 --> 02:24:56.178
<v Ricky Horton>it shows a long road in here towards just
last week when I generated the proposal</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13892-2
02:24:56.178 --> 02:24:59.477
<v Ricky Horton>for a bid that I submitted, it was it was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13897-0
02:24:59.677 --> 02:25:04.197
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so I need to start now 6:09.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13923-0
02:25:05.197 --> 02:25:10.627
<v Ricky Horton>What's the difference?
What's what the definitions are?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13923-1
02:25:10.627 --> 02:25:15.572
<v Ricky Horton>What's the?
I guess it's kind of a similar similar</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13923-2
02:25:15.572 --> 02:25:20.517
<v Ricky Horton>software.
It just has a different structure to it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13939-0
02:25:20.877 --> 02:25:24.928
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
this was set up with everything being</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13939-1
02:25:24.928 --> 02:25:29.461
<v Ricky Horton>overhead, structured,
built into your numbers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13939-2
02:25:29.461 --> 02:25:31.197
<v Ricky Horton>Heavy bit is very.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13977-0
02:25:32.077 --> 02:25:35.995
<v Ricky Horton>Overhead has its own items and broken out
a lot early.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13977-1
02:25:35.995 --> 02:25:39.129
<v Ricky Horton>Each labor item is track to its own
extent,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13977-2
02:25:39.129 --> 02:25:43.261
<v Ricky Horton>so a lot more visibility for everything
across the board,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13977-3
02:25:43.261 --> 02:25:48.960
<v Ricky Horton>whereas this has a lot of unknowns left
into this is what we know covers all of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/13977-4
02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:49.317
<v Ricky Horton>this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14018-0
02:25:49.757 --> 02:25:56.049
<v Ricky Horton>Heavy bins. Yeah, yeah, heavy bird.
Heavy bin is usually they have the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14018-1
02:25:56.049 --> 02:26:02.696
<v Ricky Horton>ability to do their field takeoffs and do
all that kind of stuff in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14018-2
02:26:02.696 --> 02:26:09.077
<v Ricky Horton>Or you can do something similar in there,
but heavy bin has a lot more.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14032-0
02:26:09.357 --> 02:26:16.042
<v Ricky Horton>All more to it, but it's it's not,
it's not, it's not,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14032-1
02:26:16.042 --> 02:26:21.877
<v Ricky Horton>so they're going to expect to do for
detection.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14061-0
02:26:23.437 --> 02:26:30.005
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this report. Yeah. Yeah.
So I I need to request. Yes. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14061-1
02:26:30.005 --> 02:26:35.431
<v Ricky Horton>this one we went in 150 in hours.
Might as well. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14061-2
02:26:35.431 --> 02:26:38.477
<v Ricky Horton>I assume we can get a heavy bid.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14085-0
02:26:38.797 --> 02:26:44.761
<v Ricky Horton>So 150 there is side of divider.
I believe it's this fast execution.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14085-1
02:26:44.761 --> 02:26:51.244
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't know one of the estimating
side of the Saints gets that runs by</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14085-2
02:26:51.244 --> 02:26:53.837
<v Ricky Horton>there are two separated three.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14102-0
02:26:53.997 --> 02:27:02.997
<v Ricky Horton>So and what I plugged in for pain was 70
hours, so pain's pretty close.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14102-1
02:27:02.997 --> 02:27:06.997
<v Ricky Horton>In fact it is slightly up there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14109-0
02:27:09.677 --> 02:27:12.917
<v Ricky Horton>Well, in this people in mind with pain,
we.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14110-0
02:27:13.917 --> 02:27:13.957
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14123-0
02:27:16.037 --> 02:27:22.317
<v Ricky Horton>We put it in the rate without considering
the efficiency.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14131-0
02:27:23.557 --> 02:27:26.917
<v Ricky Horton>So if you put that at 100,
you probably have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14140-0
02:27:28.117 --> 02:27:33.637
<v Ricky Horton>Your 70 ish, so you know,
kind of gotta figure out what to do there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14141-0
02:27:36.477 --> 02:27:36.797
<v Ricky Horton>Secrets.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14178-0
02:27:39.397 --> 02:27:43.533
<v Ricky Horton>So efficiency,
what docs to hours or docs to dollars?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14178-1
02:27:43.533 --> 02:27:48.052
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's at the hours, OK,
so if it's at 90% efficiency,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14178-2
02:27:48.052 --> 02:27:52.112
<v Ricky Horton>what it does,
it takes the calculation of the hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14178-3
02:27:52.112 --> 02:27:54.717
<v Ricky Horton>divides it by .9 to bump it up so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14179-0
02:27:54.957 --> 02:27:55.077
<v Ricky Horton>You.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14185-0
02:27:58.077 --> 02:28:00.557
<v Ricky Horton>That's what this should be part of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14195-0
02:28:03.037 --> 02:28:08.517
<v Ricky Horton>So to me the the the next biggest concern
would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14237-0
02:28:11.157 --> 02:28:13.716
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I know the total hours will be in use</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14237-1
02:28:13.716 --> 02:28:18.368
<v Ricky Horton>from here typically, if I'm not mistaken,
but it's totally being redistributed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14237-2
02:28:18.368 --> 02:28:22.555
<v Ricky Horton>So do we need to do that work,
that distribution of hours in here or do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14237-3
02:28:22.555 --> 02:28:27.208
<v Ricky Horton>they just need to stop doing what they're
doing and just say this is what we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14237-4
02:28:27.208 --> 02:28:27.557
<v Ricky Horton>using?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14281-0
02:28:27.877 --> 02:28:31.259
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
this this is what they need to be using</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14281-1
02:28:31.259 --> 02:28:37.361
<v Ricky Horton>here for for what they're doing, I guess.
And a lot of times if I'm not completely</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14281-2
02:28:37.361 --> 02:28:42.066
<v Ricky Horton>going up with something,
all we would run if if they didn't use</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14281-3
02:28:42.066 --> 02:28:46.037
<v Ricky Horton>that one to do it,
all they would run their estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14329-0
02:28:46.437 --> 02:28:53.077
<v Ricky Horton>So that there's something in here that
has this breakout. Yeah, until this point,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14329-1
02:28:53.077 --> 02:28:59.312
<v Ricky Horton>it was all some in general category.
So now this has worked out the way that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14329-2
02:28:59.312 --> 02:29:05.952
<v Ricky Horton>my form is requesting the information to
be given to me and I think it's going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14329-3
02:29:05.952 --> 02:29:06.357
<v Ricky Horton>be a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14372-0
02:29:06.357 --> 02:29:09.890
<v Ricky Horton>Beneficial.
I think I heard yesterday or day before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14372-1
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:14.090
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's always going to be very high.
Yeah, the ratio here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14372-2
02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:19.223
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's what I've heard is the
ratio between fit up and well is never</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14372-3
02:29:19.223 --> 02:29:23.957
<v Ricky Horton>right coming out of Tekla and you guys
are making adjustments to take.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14396-0
02:29:24.597 --> 02:29:28.101
<v Ricky Horton>Well time and move it to fit out time.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14396-1
02:29:28.101 --> 02:29:33.086
<v Ricky Horton>I think I was here something like that.
Yeah, that sound right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14396-2
02:29:33.086 --> 02:29:37.837
<v Ricky Horton>That does sound right,
especially in this in this situation.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14416-0
02:29:39.237 --> 02:29:45.143
<v Ricky Horton>And now you see this work program here.
This is that heavy vin. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14416-1
02:29:45.143 --> 02:29:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>he's saying heavy heavy work is a field.
I think it's their field.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14421-0
02:29:51.797 --> 02:29:56.077
<v Ricky Horton>Instructions. Well,
are they using it here?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14458-0
02:29:57.397 --> 02:30:03.762
<v Ricky Horton>You say you're at this facility,
so you know, like I don't know either.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14458-1
02:30:03.762 --> 02:30:10.216
<v Ricky Horton>Probably not. There's you. Yeah,
that's me. And they bid for estimating.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14458-2
02:30:10.216 --> 02:30:14.637
<v Ricky Horton>There's one of the field guys running a
software.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14479-0
02:30:14.997 --> 02:30:21.138
<v Ricky Horton>That's I'm not sure what they're doing to
be honest. I heard it at work,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14479-1
02:30:21.138 --> 02:30:26.438
<v Ricky Horton>but I don't know who I heard it from.
We've I mean it changes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14479-2
02:30:26.438 --> 02:30:28.037
<v Ricky Horton>changes so much so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14480-0
02:30:28.997 --> 02:30:29.037
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14482-0
02:30:31.637 --> 02:30:32.957
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14496-0
02:30:34.357 --> 02:30:38.896
<v Ricky Horton>This is the incident intact one.
This is what's about to be released</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14496-1
02:30:38.896 --> 02:30:39.357
<v Ricky Horton>before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14521-0
02:30:40.997 --> 02:30:47.546
<v Ricky Horton>We have 150 hours will be estimated for
this originally and this was the manual</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14521-1
02:30:47.546 --> 02:30:51.557
<v Ricky Horton>breakout that was put together on this
and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14527-0
02:30:53.317 --> 02:30:57.717
<v Ricky Horton>This is why we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14533-0
02:31:01.637 --> 02:31:04.397
<v Ricky Horton>My question then would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14537-0
02:31:06.437 --> 02:31:13.277
<v Ricky Horton>What's right? That's a big question.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14566-0
02:31:15.637 --> 02:31:20.122
<v Ricky Horton>If we can adjust this or whatever what it
is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14566-1
02:31:20.122 --> 02:31:25.486
<v Ricky Horton>just what what is what what is right or
they are they.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14566-2
02:31:25.486 --> 02:31:32.117
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm I'm assuming Mark's doing this
person. Yeah. So it is that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14584-0
02:31:36.477 --> 02:31:46.368
<v Ricky Horton>It was also 100% efficiency and we can
see well is closed. It is not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14584-1
02:31:46.368 --> 02:31:51.597
<v Ricky Horton>Burn is closed. That was not. That's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14607-0
02:31:51.917 --> 02:32:01.074
<v Ricky Horton>So 27 + 7 + 30 plus. Yeah,
that's like 100%. That's like 100.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14607-1
02:32:01.074 --> 02:32:07.277
<v Ricky Horton>We're gonna get 75. They're running at 75.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14613-0
02:32:07.557 --> 02:32:13.357
<v Ricky Horton>And even so go back in here and take this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14626-0
02:32:17.957 --> 02:32:21.837
<v Ricky Horton>75% see where,
see where much the differences are yet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14673-0
02:32:22.997 --> 02:32:29.542
<v Ricky Horton>I can see the reason you want to estimate
at 100% because you're going to want to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14673-1
02:32:29.542 --> 02:32:35.129
<v Ricky Horton>know and then you make the adjustments,
you run over and look at 75%.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14673-2
02:32:35.129 --> 02:32:40.637
<v Ricky Horton>We want to get that number closer,
but estimating at the lower rate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14680-0
02:32:41.237 --> 02:32:44.317
<v Ricky Horton>That just adds another tweaking factor in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14683-0
02:32:45.597 --> 02:32:48.717
<v Ricky Horton>So we'll see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14694-0
02:32:49.877 --> 02:32:53.077
<v Ricky Horton>But it will also say nobody runs it 100%
on time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14746-0
02:32:55.317 --> 02:32:58.498
<v Ricky Horton>And the problem is this one day we're
building a canopy,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14746-1
02:32:58.498 --> 02:33:01.233
<v Ricky Horton>one day we're building 6 line stainless
for all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14746-2
02:33:01.233 --> 02:33:05.642
<v Ricky Horton>One day we're building aluminum rail,
the next day we're throwing boxes in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14746-3
02:33:05.642 --> 02:33:09.325
<v Ricky Horton>mix and then the next day we have
structural columns in it. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14746-4
02:33:09.325 --> 02:33:11.837
<v Ricky Horton>so and because of that,
we're not efficient.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14775-0
02:33:12.077 --> 02:33:19.742
<v Ricky Horton>You're switching up all the work and you
don't have a really good system going on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14775-1
02:33:19.742 --> 02:33:27.221
<v Ricky Horton>one thing and you're about to. Thank you.
I think 75% scandal way out of there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14775-2
02:33:27.221 --> 02:33:28.717
<v Ricky Horton>Looks like he's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14807-0
02:33:29.077 --> 02:33:39.862
<v Ricky Horton>All this discussion,
so it looks like he's using the basic</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14807-1
02:33:39.862 --> 02:33:46.077
<v Ricky Horton>breakdowns of burging that before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14859-0
02:33:46.957 --> 02:33:51.176
<v Ricky Horton>But he's redistributing fit up and well,
redistributing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14859-1
02:33:51.176 --> 02:33:57.246
<v Ricky Horton>handling it cut because the fit up well
is essential on both the tunnels and both</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14859-2
02:33:57.246 --> 02:34:02.650
<v Ricky Horton>are essentially the same hours.
So it looks like he's redistributing it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14859-3
02:34:02.650 --> 02:34:04.797
<v Ricky Horton>redistributing it. Excuse me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14889-0
02:34:05.237 --> 02:34:10.441
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm going to bet.
Let's see what the difference in the will</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14889-1
02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:14.226
<v Ricky Horton>is right here. So we've got 61.
95 total hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14889-2
02:34:14.226 --> 02:34:18.957
<v Ricky Horton>The bottom one is 100 and yes,
it's like it's like the top.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14905-0
02:34:20.357 --> 02:34:27.757
<v Ricky Horton>He's about 120 because you got 6135,
that's 100, 119.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14933-0
02:34:30.037 --> 02:34:36.233
<v Ricky Horton>We got a 40% difference in weld.
Go back into power fab real quick,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14933-1
02:34:36.233 --> 02:34:41.701
<v Ricky Horton>go up to maintenance,
estimating even labor maintenance and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14933-2
02:34:41.701 --> 02:34:42.157
<v Ricky Horton>weld.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14962-0
02:34:43.637 --> 02:34:48.412
<v Ricky Horton>Was 150 the actual 150?
Remember when we saw the job before it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14962-1
02:34:48.412 --> 02:34:54.249
<v Ricky Horton>was 119 and there was that overage?
That's why I remember seeing that you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/14962-2
02:34:54.249 --> 02:34:57.357
<v Ricky Horton>got the fillet wheel manual quarter inch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15005-0
02:35:06.197 --> 02:35:09.972
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, 6 foot three.
So I consider this right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15005-1
02:35:09.972 --> 02:35:16.702
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I was like, OK, 40% difference.
I consider this rate about 40% slower.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15005-2
02:35:16.702 --> 02:35:21.299
<v Ricky Horton>I usually will see the rate per hour
around 11:50 feet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15005-3
02:35:21.299 --> 02:35:23.597
<v Ricky Horton>So the 10 feet is around 40.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15042-0
02:35:24.037 --> 02:35:29.793
<v Ricky Horton>40% difference. So yeah,
I'm wondering if we change,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15042-1
02:35:29.793 --> 02:35:36.418
<v Ricky Horton>if we sped this up,
now you're waiting times will come down,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15042-2
02:35:36.418 --> 02:35:39.677
<v Ricky Horton>then again we we redistribute.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15074-0
02:35:40.917 --> 02:35:43.792
<v Ricky Horton>Those hours and you guys,
you got all those,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15074-1
02:35:43.792 --> 02:35:48.393
<v Ricky Horton>you just change the quarter inch ones and
make the other ones go, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15074-2
02:35:48.393 --> 02:35:52.547
<v Ricky Horton>bring that out-of-the-box.
The the if you put a a filled well on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15074-3
02:35:52.547 --> 02:35:56.317
<v Ricky Horton>some out-of-the-box,
you should put a quarter still on it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15121-0
02:35:56.797 --> 02:36:00.126
<v Ricky Horton>And then you can you,
I think you created some other ones,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15121-1
02:36:00.126 --> 02:36:02.666
<v Ricky Horton>right.
But it's pretty much a pipeline where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15121-2
02:36:02.666 --> 02:36:06.673
<v Ricky Horton>you're saying you're like more inch to
four days probably or whatever.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15121-3
02:36:06.673 --> 02:36:10.454
<v Ricky Horton>So we could change those,
those few in that range and see where it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15121-4
02:36:10.454 --> 02:36:12.317
<v Ricky Horton>goes and yeah, you you certainly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15134-0
02:36:12.517 --> 02:36:16.725
<v Ricky Horton>So let me ask you this,
when when this calculation happens for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15134-1
02:36:16.725 --> 02:36:19.397
<v Ricky Horton>quarter inch, they'll run a single pass.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-0
02:36:21.157 --> 02:36:25.339
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, depending on the type. Well,
the quarters is right there in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-1
02:36:25.339 --> 02:36:28.805
<v Ricky Horton>morning 2 passes,
3/8 is 33/8 is definitely more than one</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-2
02:36:28.805 --> 02:36:31.614
<v Ricky Horton>pass.
So how does the math look if you're just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-3
02:36:31.614 --> 02:36:34.661
<v Ricky Horton>putting in the rank,
it's not bigger at the point.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-4
02:36:34.661 --> 02:36:38.187
<v Ricky Horton>It's not bigger,
but it's going to extrapolate against the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15184-5
02:36:38.187 --> 02:36:40.637
<v Ricky Horton>length. It's going to multiply by length.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15228-0
02:36:40.917 --> 02:36:44.167
<v Ricky Horton>So if you put a,
let's let's take something simple.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15228-1
02:36:44.167 --> 02:36:48.729
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say my rate is 5 feet per hour for
three inch. That's what I know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15228-2
02:36:48.729 --> 02:36:53.604
<v Ricky Horton>I know guys can go faster than that,
but that's just the estimated rate for a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15228-3
02:36:53.604 --> 02:36:55.917
<v Ricky Horton>three pass level when it's half inch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15271-0
02:36:55.957 --> 02:37:00.418
<v Ricky Horton>When it's half inch, yeah,
you're going to do 6 pass, whatever,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15271-1
02:37:00.418 --> 02:37:05.716
<v Ricky Horton>5 pass and the quarter inch rate.
I'm used to seeing this can't put and you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15271-2
02:37:05.716 --> 02:37:09.899
<v Ricky Horton>can whale a whole lot faster than that up,
honestly, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15271-3
02:37:09.899 --> 02:37:12.757
<v Ricky Horton>That's what that's where most people are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15315-0
02:37:12.997 --> 02:37:17.513
<v Ricky Horton>In that range for estimated purchase.
Yeah, of course you have to figure out,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15315-1
02:37:17.513 --> 02:37:21.334
<v Ricky Horton>you know, what you put in.
And I get asked all the time, what is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15315-2
02:37:21.334 --> 02:37:25.272
<v Ricky Horton>what does that consist of? Well,
most people do consider yourself a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15315-3
02:37:25.272 --> 02:37:28.804
<v Ricky Horton>machine playing, uh, sure, you know,
knocking the beans off.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15315-4
02:37:28.804 --> 02:37:31.757
<v Ricky Horton>I guess they put all that in there.
So absolutely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15325-0
02:37:32.037 --> 02:37:35.966
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so um,
that's and this is figuring like a big</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15325-1
02:37:35.966 --> 02:37:36.797
<v Ricky Horton>bug, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15367-0
02:37:38.117 --> 02:37:43.109
<v Ricky Horton>You're right. Yes, I agree with you. Well,
if I I'm saying to whatever you want it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15367-1
02:37:43.109 --> 02:37:46.358
<v Ricky Horton>to be, OK, why not?
Because like we can get a stitch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15367-2
02:37:46.358 --> 02:37:50.208
<v Ricky Horton>I get asked all the time. OK,
what's the pattern in the stitch?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15367-3
02:37:50.208 --> 02:37:53.757
<v Ricky Horton>It's a rate. Yeah, that's what it means.
It's just a rate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15405-0
02:37:54.117 --> 02:37:57.689
<v Ricky Horton>Now I've built stitch rails for different
patterns,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15405-1
02:37:57.689 --> 02:38:02.566
<v Ricky Horton>but all of this is just the right.
So consider what you want it to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15405-2
02:38:02.566 --> 02:38:06.344
<v Ricky Horton>I can consider,
I can consider manual to be, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15405-3
02:38:06.344 --> 02:38:11.565
<v Ricky Horton>for about willing if I wanted to.
I'm just putting whatever rate I want for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15405-4
02:38:11.565 --> 02:38:13.557
<v Ricky Horton>that particular process here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15406-0
02:38:13.877 --> 02:38:14.157
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15407-0
02:38:18.237 --> 02:38:19.277
<v Ricky Horton>Kind of flip flat.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15421-0
02:38:21.237 --> 02:38:23.661
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
when you probably want to be on your main</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15421-1
02:38:23.661 --> 02:38:26.032
<v Ricky Horton>shop,
'cause that's the one that that you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15421-2
02:38:26.032 --> 02:38:26.717
<v Ricky Horton>using, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15455-0
02:38:30.357 --> 02:38:34.043
<v Ricky Horton>Which, which main node?
I guess I was thinking not. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15455-1
02:38:34.043 --> 02:38:38.300
<v Ricky Horton>I was thinking that was the one you were
using. We can get a look.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15455-2
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:43.194
<v Ricky Horton>This is the one that we added last time
you were here so that we could tweak</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15455-3
02:38:43.194 --> 02:38:45.037
<v Ricky Horton>numbers and move them around.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15484-0
02:38:45.437 --> 02:38:50.944
<v Ricky Horton>So what's being used to best?
What's the main? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15484-1
02:38:50.944 --> 02:38:58.218
<v Ricky Horton>it means the the last one to change.
So do we want to then go to 3/8?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15484-2
02:38:58.218 --> 02:39:04.557
<v Ricky Horton>Put in your What did you say?
I was thinking the same thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15512-0
02:39:06.997 --> 02:39:10.521
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I actually have it much slower
here. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15512-1
02:39:10.521 --> 02:39:15.678
<v Ricky Horton>it's just whatever is the standard here.
I'm used to using 5 feet and then and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15512-2
02:39:15.678 --> 02:39:20.378
<v Ricky Horton>then do you want to do like 5-6 feet
somewhere in between there and the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15512-3
02:39:20.378 --> 02:39:21.357
<v Ricky Horton>calendar there?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15517-0
02:39:22.597 --> 02:39:25.237
<v Ricky Horton>They go back and fix one eggs too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15552-0
02:39:38.637 --> 02:39:43.516
<v Ricky Horton>So what happens? You know,
the estimator probably not gonna notice,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15552-1
02:39:43.516 --> 02:39:48.611
<v Ricky Horton>but when you guys do these beams,
these buildups and now you go from a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15552-2
02:39:48.611 --> 02:39:50.477
<v Ricky Horton>manual process to submark.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15608-0
02:39:51.957 --> 02:39:55.611
<v Ricky Horton>At the estimating stage,
would they ever do that or in the future</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15608-1
02:39:55.611 --> 02:39:58.934
<v Ricky Horton>will they do that?
Are you going to have a sub arc or a sub</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15608-2
02:39:58.934 --> 02:40:03.364
<v Ricky Horton>arc is still encapsulated within? Well,
because it will be right, I've created.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15608-3
02:40:03.364 --> 02:40:06.908
<v Ricky Horton>I've created another right.
You're going to use them a lot when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15608-4
02:40:06.908 --> 02:40:08.957
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to have to make another.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15650-0
02:40:09.397 --> 02:40:15.395
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't do it yet.
If I grade on already thinking because we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15650-1
02:40:15.395 --> 02:40:19.519
<v Ricky Horton>know that when we Weld some work on a
boom,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15650-2
02:40:19.519 --> 02:40:25.237
<v Ricky Horton>we know the machine can do 22 inches a
minute. We know that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15678-0
02:40:25.797 --> 02:40:31.608
<v Ricky Horton>And it's a two pass well for us all the
way up to half inch inside,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15678-1
02:40:31.608 --> 02:40:37.677
<v Ricky Horton>outside two pass well, we're done. Yeah,
and that one was more of the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15745-0
02:40:38.917 --> 02:40:43.718
<v Ricky Horton>We don't think you have enough data right
now to because you did one job and you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15745-1
02:40:43.718 --> 02:40:46.918
<v Ricky Horton>could do it,
but if you started doing sub arc welding</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15745-2
02:40:46.918 --> 02:40:50.119
<v Ricky Horton>lobby work,
you need to deal with that because that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15745-3
02:40:50.119 --> 02:40:54.920
<v Ricky Horton>something. I'll met with shop last week.
I forget what the what the assembly was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15745-4
02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.477
<v Ricky Horton>and they were working on the shop done,
but they they want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15747-0
02:40:58.717 --> 02:40:58.997
<v Ricky Horton>Job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15779-0
02:41:00.277 --> 02:41:09.361
<v Ricky Horton>But then they when it came down to the
they they need some work. It was savings,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15779-1
02:41:09.361 --> 02:41:17.437
<v Ricky Horton>but it if were you guys were welding it
like this, like this, you know?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15800-0
02:41:18.197 --> 02:41:23.390
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
working working one way back and forth.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15800-1
02:41:23.390 --> 02:41:32.308
<v Ricky Horton>So today we're talking about running them
and we we could be that switching it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15800-2
02:41:32.308 --> 02:41:33.437
<v Ricky Horton>around so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15802-0
02:41:33.877 --> 02:41:36.237
<v Ricky Horton>But I hear how many are left to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15811-0
02:41:38.597 --> 02:41:42.902
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
you got to plan average to see if I can</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15811-1
02:41:42.902 --> 02:41:43.277
<v Ricky Horton>see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15845-0
02:41:44.797 --> 02:41:54.735
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe we should change the envelope for
18316 quarter 516 to 380.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15845-1
02:41:54.735 --> 02:42:02.717
<v Ricky Horton>That's the most standard on the airport.
Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15865-0
02:42:05.117 --> 02:42:14.003
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and those ones are, those ones are.
I'm sure we got 10 foot, 5, sixteens, 8,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15865-1
02:42:14.003 --> 02:42:19.677
<v Ricky Horton>six creates 5 foot.
Then how about 3/16 and 1/83/16?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15881-0
02:42:20.477 --> 02:42:28.284
<v Ricky Horton>Seven and 1/8. Yeah.
And what do you got for quarter? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15881-1
02:42:28.284 --> 02:42:31.277
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So we'll do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15906-0
02:42:40.757 --> 02:42:44.285
<v Ricky Horton>I can do the tech study on at the late
time, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15906-1
02:42:44.285 --> 02:42:49.403
<v Ricky Horton>and just so that we can have that.
So I'll have to check them out because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15906-2
02:42:49.403 --> 02:42:52.516
<v Ricky Horton>they should have gotten that done last
week,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15906-3
02:42:52.516 --> 02:42:55.837
<v Ricky Horton>but having them do it 45 to be better
long and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15908-0
02:42:56.277 --> 02:42:57.877
<v Ricky Horton>One inch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15913-0
02:42:59.437 --> 02:43:04.436
<v Ricky Horton>3 eights half inch. Yeah,
you do it that way. So you can cover your,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15913-1
02:43:04.436 --> 02:43:08.131
<v Ricky Horton>you got to do that double.
And then something, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15913-2
02:43:08.131 --> 02:43:10.957
<v Ricky Horton>a single level or a double level, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15949-0
02:43:13.397 --> 02:43:16.670
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
he's like to say you can update the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15949-1
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:21.034
<v Ricky Horton>retention anyway.
Let's get to the ballpark. All right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15949-2
02:43:21.034 --> 02:43:26.956
<v Ricky Horton>So we've brought the wheel down,
down the pit where we need to get back up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15949-3
02:43:26.956 --> 02:43:28.437
<v Ricky Horton>So the question is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15984-0
02:43:28.437 --> 02:43:32.289
<v Ricky Horton>How much?
A bunch of operations to change your lab.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15984-1
02:43:32.289 --> 02:43:37.475
<v Ricky Horton>And what I would probably do is say, OK,
where do we want that to be?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15984-2
02:43:37.475 --> 02:43:42.438
<v Ricky Horton>What percentage is that?
And we'll see everything that is going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15984-3
02:43:42.438 --> 02:43:42.957
<v Ricky Horton>fit up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15996-0
02:43:43.557 --> 02:43:49.819
<v Ricky Horton>We will just.
It made the easiest thing to do. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/15996-1
02:43:49.819 --> 02:43:51.237
<v Ricky Horton>but we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16004-0
02:43:58.237 --> 02:44:03.883
<v Ricky Horton>In order to and still need to have,
we've just doubled.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16004-1
02:44:03.883 --> 02:44:09.025
<v Ricky Horton>I was going to say we're basically about
50%. Yep.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16004-2
02:44:09.025 --> 02:44:12.957
<v Ricky Horton>So let's try that and see what it does.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16042-0
02:44:22.917 --> 02:44:27.549
<v Ricky Horton>Like your standards.
Do they have any bid for shop segregation</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16042-1
02:44:27.549 --> 02:44:31.739
<v Ricky Horton>as many as well or just for a few?
They have. They have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16042-2
02:44:31.739 --> 02:44:36.445
<v Ricky Horton>It's just this morning.
I always wish they were just across the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16042-3
02:44:36.445 --> 02:44:39.974
<v Ricky Horton>board.
We're doing all the things like this for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16042-4
02:44:39.974 --> 02:44:41.077
<v Ricky Horton>this, you know?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16045-0
02:44:41.997 --> 02:44:44.997
<v Ricky Horton>Well, Mr.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16064-0
02:44:46.717 --> 02:44:50.857
<v Ricky Horton>Tells I'm a lot of Mr. Jason.
You never know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16064-1
02:44:50.857 --> 02:44:58.147
<v Ricky Horton>We've been doing this five times here.
You know we got five groups of materials.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16064-2
02:44:58.147 --> 02:45:02.197
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't think shoot your room need to
do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16070-0
02:45:03.437 --> 02:45:06.381
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
we can probably tell what you want with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16070-1
02:45:06.381 --> 02:45:07.917
<v Ricky Horton>this once going to fear.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16079-0
02:45:10.277 --> 02:45:14.077
<v Ricky Horton>I guess the the layout is going to get a
few as well, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16087-0
02:45:15.477 --> 02:45:19.517
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you know, layout stuff.
I'm not sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16095-0
02:45:37.717 --> 02:45:41.437
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll lay up and check stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16096-0
02:45:45.077 --> 02:45:46.957
<v Ricky Horton>I just gotta be only if you will change.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16099-0
02:45:52.437 --> 02:45:52.557
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16101-0
02:45:54.237 --> 02:45:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16104-0
02:46:00.277 --> 02:46:02.557
<v Ricky Horton>At 2:50 so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16105-0
02:46:09.277 --> 02:46:09.837
<v Ricky Horton>Then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16112-0
02:46:17.117 --> 02:46:18.157
<v Ricky Horton>75's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16120-0
02:46:24.357 --> 02:46:30.397
<v Ricky Horton>I'll take a little nap while you're doing
this, but it's all right. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16131-0
02:46:37.077 --> 02:46:40.598
<v Ricky Horton>It wasn't quiet out there.
It must be on break. Oh yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16131-1
02:46:40.598 --> 02:46:42.637
<v Ricky Horton>it's 10:40 when they're on lunch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16137-0
02:46:43.397 --> 02:46:46.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I couldn't tell. I see it set up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16144-0
02:46:48.997 --> 02:46:57.117
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there's about five boxes left. Yeah,
sorry.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16146-0
02:46:59.317 --> 02:47:01.037
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody to change.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16148-0
02:47:02.717 --> 02:47:05.477
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry, 0.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16150-0
02:47:05.797 --> 02:47:08.097
<v Ricky Horton>Why is that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16164-0
02:47:16.037 --> 02:47:21.983
<v Ricky Horton>Well, to punish Nathan,
you don't need to get up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16164-1
02:47:21.983 --> 02:47:24.837
<v Ricky Horton>That's why it's sincere.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16171-0
02:47:38.477 --> 02:47:41.437
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just mad for it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16173-0
02:47:42.557 --> 02:47:43.517
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to do it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16181-0
02:47:45.077 --> 02:47:51.273
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.
I'm crypt and blah blah calculator.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16181-1
02:47:51.273 --> 02:47:54.437
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty good at math.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16182-0
02:48:01.317 --> 02:48:02.277
<v Ricky Horton>Repeat.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16185-0
02:48:20.117 --> 02:48:29.077
<v Ricky Horton>633367 I think I think so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16188-0
02:48:47.797 --> 02:48:48.277
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16190-0
02:48:56.237 --> 02:48:56.837
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, baby.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16195-0
02:48:58.477 --> 02:49:04.437
<v Ricky Horton>The chicken ain't here yet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16227-0
02:49:20.957 --> 02:49:26.273
<v Ricky Horton>Like level. I've never done one.
So all we're doing is we get more</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16227-1
02:49:26.273 --> 02:49:32.858
<v Ricky Horton>realistic well times and we make up for
the time we've been using by adding it to,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16227-2
02:49:32.858 --> 02:49:35.477
<v Ricky Horton>you know, the layout. Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16240-0
02:49:37.837 --> 02:49:40.733
<v Ricky Horton>Then we have a run that against the
sample size.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16240-1
02:49:40.733 --> 02:49:44.397
<v Ricky Horton>Now we're looking at one and we're going
to look at it at 36.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16247-0
02:49:45.037 --> 02:49:48.357
<v Ricky Horton>It's got 6892 with 136.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16259-0
02:49:56.717 --> 02:49:59.497
<v Ricky Horton>Was Mark going to give you a bunch of
jobs?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16259-1
02:49:59.497 --> 02:50:02.277
<v Ricky Horton>Was Mark going to give you a bunch of
jobs?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16264-0
02:50:08.317 --> 02:50:09.877
<v Ricky Horton>I was kind of halfway.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16281-0
02:50:13.757 --> 02:50:20.174
<v Ricky Horton>And that's why I wondered if it mattered.
I don't want to be where we wanted to be,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16281-1
02:50:20.174 --> 02:50:22.237
<v Ricky Horton>but it yeah, it looks like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-0
02:50:24.517 --> 02:50:27.513
<v Ricky Horton>It looks. I bet she's got,
I bet she's got one. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-1
02:50:27.513 --> 02:50:29.955
<v Ricky Horton>we could get back to what they're
actually.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-2
02:50:29.955 --> 02:50:34.505
<v Ricky Horton>We just appoint one schedule and then go
back to the jobs now and see if it comes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-3
02:50:34.505 --> 02:50:37.112
<v Ricky Horton>out right.
You get that same e-mail when every</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-4
02:50:37.112 --> 02:50:39.998
<v Ricky Horton>single job,
every single release it says here's the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16337-5
02:50:39.998 --> 02:50:40.997
<v Ricky Horton>hours we're using.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16343-0
02:50:43.037 --> 02:50:45.645
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
we we can go back and check a bunch of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16343-1
02:50:45.645 --> 02:50:46.357
<v Ricky Horton>those, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16375-0
02:50:51.997 --> 02:50:56.263
<v Ricky Horton>But I think you have to check it at 2
levels because I have a feeling that Mark</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16375-1
02:50:56.263 --> 02:50:58.930
<v Ricky Horton>is correcting the the older pattern
because yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16375-2
02:50:58.930 --> 02:51:02.877
<v Ricky Horton>they're going to be changed and that's
why they came out exactly the same</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16375-3
02:51:02.877 --> 02:51:07.037
<v Ricky Horton>because somebody's modified. I know.
So it's got to go back up a level, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16382-0
02:51:10.237 --> 02:51:13.517
<v Ricky Horton>But I have a feeling now if they run it
through check the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16390-0
02:51:14.837 --> 02:51:20.077
<v Ricky Horton>We're building it to the matchbox hours,
OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16397-0
02:51:27.557 --> 02:51:30.997
<v Ricky Horton>Now we'll test the system.
This this should.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16405-0
02:51:32.517 --> 02:51:35.277
<v Ricky Horton>What times takes a while to do this?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16409-0
02:51:48.917 --> 02:51:49.957
<v Ricky Horton>That's how it would.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16414-0
02:52:02.477 --> 02:52:04.197
<v Ricky Horton>He gave me something hard to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16416-0
02:52:06.157 --> 02:52:07.277
<v Ricky Horton>That's my back here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16424-0
02:52:16.157 --> 02:52:19.397
<v Ricky Horton>He's gotta get this damn thing run for
two weeks, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16427-0
02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:23.477
<v Ricky Horton>Just to grab a beep.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16434-0
02:52:24.957 --> 02:52:30.437
<v Ricky Horton>I wish. Let's go. It's not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16438-0
02:52:34.477 --> 02:52:36.677
<v Ricky Horton>Better have gone to Barloway last night.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16439-0
02:52:38.117 --> 02:52:38.397
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16441-0
02:52:39.637 --> 02:52:39.877
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16455-0
02:52:41.837 --> 02:52:46.925
<v Ricky Horton>Or it was, uh, let me see.
Let me they didn't have those two burgers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16455-1
02:52:46.925 --> 02:52:50.197
<v Ricky Horton>Tuesday burger. We had like, uh,
$8 burgers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16470-0
02:52:52.037 --> 02:52:59.165
<v Ricky Horton>Check your. That's great. Yeah,
it's fixed. Yeah, I'm kidding.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16470-1
02:52:59.165 --> 02:53:03.917
<v Ricky Horton>These aren't what I have is gonna be good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16507-0
02:53:09.437 --> 02:53:14.238
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's what we did a minute ago.
Yeah, OK, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16507-1
02:53:14.238 --> 02:53:21.485
<v Ricky Horton>but we're going to the end shade families.
So we did all the these lectures. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16507-2
02:53:21.485 --> 02:53:27.247
<v Ricky Horton>channels and everything.
That would be all anything that's taller</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16507-3
02:53:27.247 --> 02:53:28.557
<v Ricky Horton>than the spice.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16508-0
02:53:29.797 --> 02:53:29.917
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16509-0
02:53:31.197 --> 02:53:31.317
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16540-0
02:53:48.637 --> 02:53:54.567
<v Ricky Horton>That's it.
Somebody got to determine what percentage</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16540-1
02:53:54.567 --> 02:54:00.722
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to use to 75% of pay numbers
we ever want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16540-2
02:54:00.722 --> 02:54:06.317
<v Ricky Horton>I think 75% of the estimated amount is
not right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16548-0
02:54:06.477 --> 02:54:12.717
<v Ricky Horton>So I I I go to find the other one thing
because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16558-0
02:54:14.157 --> 02:54:18.517
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think anybody's runs 100%
efficient and I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16563-0
02:54:19.357 --> 02:54:22.397
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I understand your reasons, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16574-0
02:54:23.357 --> 02:54:27.797
<v Ricky Horton>The reasoning is we want to know what it
actually takes, but I get that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-0
02:54:28.637 --> 02:54:32.215
<v Ricky Horton>If we if we had time studies and we knew
all these were real,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-1
02:54:32.215 --> 02:54:36.141
<v Ricky Horton>then I would agree with you that if you
have one. But I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-2
02:54:36.141 --> 02:54:40.181
<v Ricky Horton>I don't believe we have the right time
studies yet. I agree with you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-3
02:54:40.181 --> 02:54:44.511
<v Ricky Horton>So until we get the right steps,
in my opinion, you have to be more like .</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-4
02:54:44.511 --> 02:54:47.050
<v Ricky Horton>9.
So one of the things I would do a lot of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16624-5
02:54:47.050 --> 02:54:47.397
<v Ricky Horton>times.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16641-0
02:54:48.637 --> 02:54:53.566
<v Ricky Horton>Say my were busy. Yeah,
I would start adding contingency 'cause I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16641-1
02:54:53.566 --> 02:54:58.197
<v Ricky Horton>knew that other queries were not as fast
as my. Yeah, I mean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16657-0
02:55:00.637 --> 02:55:03.521
<v Ricky Horton>There's so many ways to tweak it, right?
There is. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16657-1
02:55:03.521 --> 02:55:06.202
<v Ricky Horton>It's just when it's being tweaked in the
background,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16657-2
02:55:06.202 --> 02:55:08.277
<v Ricky Horton>you don't actually know what it is, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16700-0
02:55:21.757 --> 02:55:27.680
<v Ricky Horton>I also know if we can keep the shop on
over time, 45 and 50 more efficient.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16700-1
02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:31.266
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah,
once we've got over 52 hours a week,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16700-2
02:55:31.266 --> 02:55:35.397
<v Ricky Horton>then then cover the comments that we made
yesterday.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16700-3
02:55:35.397 --> 02:55:38.437
<v Ricky Horton>You wouldn't have guys standing around.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16735-0
02:55:38.717 --> 02:55:41.595
<v Ricky Horton>Wondering where you're going with your
time,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16735-1
02:55:41.595 --> 02:55:46.265
<v Ricky Horton>which job are you going to put the time
on? Well, that's the crazy part.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16735-2
02:55:46.265 --> 02:55:51.383
<v Ricky Horton>I think we were three years ago. I was,
I was working 70 hours a week trying to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16735-3
02:55:51.383 --> 02:55:55.157
<v Ricky Horton>push packages out to the shop,
programming and purchasing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16776-0
02:55:55.517 --> 02:56:01.117
<v Ricky Horton>And the shop was working 708090 hours a
day. We were always busy,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16776-1
02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:06.123
<v Ricky Horton>always ever coming in.
And there's between estimators just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16776-2
02:56:06.123 --> 02:56:12.995
<v Ricky Horton>rewarding shop only work to us supporting
the field with anything and everything</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16776-3
02:56:12.995 --> 02:56:15.117
<v Ricky Horton>that they needed. Always.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16816-0
02:56:15.197 --> 02:56:20.568
<v Ricky Horton>Now it's, I mean, so what changed?
I guess the department doesn't,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16816-1
02:56:20.568 --> 02:56:24.656
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't support us nearly as much as they
used to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16816-2
02:56:24.656 --> 02:56:30.989
<v Ricky Horton>We'll send them their opportunities and
we'll sit on that until that's the way</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16816-3
02:56:30.989 --> 02:56:34.757
<v Ricky Horton>that's the due date or won't we get it at
all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16858-0
02:56:35.037 --> 02:56:39.179
<v Ricky Horton>But what are they? I mean,
I hear that they want to keep hiring</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16858-1
02:56:39.179 --> 02:56:42.350
<v Ricky Horton>estimators.
They're doing what's estimating when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16858-2
02:56:42.350 --> 02:56:46.427
<v Ricky Horton>rates are really low.
Are we just chasing along with the work?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16858-3
02:56:46.427 --> 02:56:49.404
<v Ricky Horton>That could be,
that could be a portion of it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16858-4
02:56:49.404 --> 02:56:52.317
<v Ricky Horton>but a lot of the work we're looking at
were.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16889-0
02:56:52.397 --> 02:56:58.639
<v Ricky Horton>I think some of it's our labor rates too,
because we're charging big shop rates and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16889-1
02:56:58.639 --> 02:57:04.807
<v Ricky Horton>we're we don't have big shop and when we
end up having to put your more money into</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16889-2
02:57:04.807 --> 02:57:06.517
<v Ricky Horton>subbing things out and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16937-0
02:57:06.677 --> 02:57:11.506
<v Ricky Horton>Things out and and then me trying to
account for that in the budget and a lot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16937-1
02:57:11.506 --> 02:57:15.963
<v Ricky Horton>of times I'll deduct hours because
obviously everyone's more efficient.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16937-2
02:57:15.963 --> 02:57:20.916
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll deduct that from my labor and
reduce my labor hours and take that extra</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16937-3
02:57:20.916 --> 02:57:24.197
<v Ricky Horton>money and put it towards the sub
application bucket.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16973-0
02:57:24.557 --> 02:57:30.781
<v Ricky Horton>They're not always considering that and
so that's bringing us sometimes before</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16973-1
02:57:30.781 --> 02:57:37.242
<v Ricky Horton>and but most of all of the the fab only
work that we've gotten this year has been</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/16973-2
02:57:37.242 --> 02:57:40.237
<v Ricky Horton>stuff that we need remark for bidding.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17007-0
02:57:40.397 --> 02:57:49.565
<v Ricky Horton>And it's a lot of the stuff that we're
not getting is that that kind of said the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17007-1
02:57:49.565 --> 02:57:55.225
<v Ricky Horton>estimators.
I think they are just as many as they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17007-2
02:57:55.225 --> 02:57:56.357
<v Ricky Horton>were, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17060-0
02:57:57.277 --> 02:58:02.573
<v Ricky Horton>It's a mixture now because they've got
some of the guys who are doing structural</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17060-1
02:58:02.573 --> 02:58:07.803
<v Ricky Horton>doing electrical estimates because we're
heavily becoming an electrical company</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17060-2
02:58:07.803 --> 02:58:13.034
<v Ricky Horton>because there's so much revenue in that
and so that just feels like their focus</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17060-3
02:58:13.034 --> 02:58:16.957
<v Ricky Horton>has shifted to a different area and they
don't give us new.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17080-0
02:58:17.237 --> 02:58:22.442
<v Ricky Horton>It's because there's so much more over
there, there's so much more, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17080-1
02:58:22.442 --> 02:58:26.100
<v Ricky Horton>that goes into the shop.
That's what I mean, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17080-2
02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:27.437
<v Ricky Horton>So and that's like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17124-0
02:58:28.757 --> 02:58:32.821
<v Ricky Horton>Are we removing the fabrication or what
are we needing? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17124-1
02:58:32.821 --> 02:58:38.262
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's why they want to go after
more custom miscellaneous work that other</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17124-2
02:58:38.262 --> 02:58:41.605
<v Ricky Horton>trades don't want to do.
So like the data centers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17124-3
02:58:41.605 --> 02:58:43.637
<v Ricky Horton>they got tons of miscellaneous.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17158-0
02:58:43.677 --> 02:58:46.969
<v Ricky Horton>We call it more difficult than average
miscellaneous.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17158-1
02:58:46.969 --> 02:58:50.200
<v Ricky Horton>It's not building draft beads and ladders,
you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17158-2
02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:53.614
<v Ricky Horton>it's really custom miscellaneous work
that other shops.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17158-3
02:58:53.614 --> 02:58:56.785
<v Ricky Horton>They're just afraid to do it, you know?
Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17158-4
02:58:56.785 --> 02:58:58.797
<v Ricky Horton>So the son picked up these skids.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17179-0
02:58:59.237 --> 02:59:03.514
<v Ricky Horton>It was 92 skids. Yeah,
it was $40 million worth of work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17179-1
02:59:03.514 --> 02:59:08.391
<v Ricky Horton>There's the other shops. Well,
there's skid shops out there now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17179-2
02:59:08.391 --> 02:59:09.517
<v Ricky Horton>They were full.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17210-0
02:59:10.917 --> 02:59:17.082
<v Ricky Horton>And some have never built skids before,
but the K guys that came over there were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17210-1
02:59:17.082 --> 02:59:22.105
<v Ricky Horton>used to building skids.
So they went from a three-man crew to now</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17210-2
02:59:22.105 --> 02:59:24.237
<v Ricky Horton>up to an 18 man crew to the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17238-0
02:59:25.237 --> 02:59:30.579
<v Ricky Horton>And all they're really doing is
assembling because they don't have,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17238-1
02:59:30.579 --> 02:59:34.821
<v Ricky Horton>they don't have any equipment.
There's just assembly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17238-2
02:59:34.821 --> 02:59:40.557
<v Ricky Horton>We call it fusion welding. OK,
so fusion welding, they're buying it out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17242-0
02:59:43.077 --> 02:59:46.077
<v Ricky Horton>We're good. Yeah, reporting to work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17274-0
03:00:00.957 --> 03:00:06.180
<v Ricky Horton>I think you and I are gonna need to align
for what? We're gonna need to align.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17274-1
03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:09.817
<v Ricky Horton>Could be. I know.
I think it's easier that way because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17274-2
03:00:09.817 --> 03:00:13.917
<v Ricky Horton>otherwise it's a mixed message coming. OK,
I agree with that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17301-0
03:00:15.197 --> 03:00:18.859
<v Ricky Horton>And I I think we're really close on most
tires. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17301-1
03:00:18.859 --> 03:00:24.556
<v Ricky Horton>I think you're constructional slowing and
I have tanks, stuff like chairs and like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17301-2
03:00:24.556 --> 03:00:26.997
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
I think I'm on the structural</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17301-3
03:00:26.997 --> 03:00:30.117
<v Ricky Horton>miscellaneous stuff and I think that it's
my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17331-0
03:00:30.597 --> 03:00:34.440
<v Ricky Horton>And So what I'm telling,
what I'm kind of saying is data centers</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17331-1
03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:38.401
<v Ricky Horton>are pretty similar. Yeah.
And the interesting part of data centers</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17331-2
03:00:38.401 --> 03:00:41.357
<v Ricky Horton>is actually how they're going to give
them power.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17363-0
03:00:42.317 --> 03:00:48.002
<v Ricky Horton>Because there's no power for data centers,
that's what everybody's mentioned about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17363-1
03:00:48.002 --> 03:00:53.484
<v Ricky Horton>So they're trying to Congress, you know,
they propose a bill in Congress to stop</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17363-2
03:00:53.484 --> 03:00:58.357
<v Ricky Horton>data center build out for a year till
they figure out how to deal with.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17372-0
03:00:58.477 --> 03:01:04.818
<v Ricky Horton>Chart with power and water,
because the whole country is that's it's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17372-1
03:01:04.818 --> 03:01:06.197
<v Ricky Horton>hard something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17373-0
03:01:08.637 --> 03:01:08.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17386-0
03:01:13.917 --> 03:01:18.517
<v Ricky Horton>And so I think that these data center
people are realizing that if they don't.</v>

03:01:19.757 --> 03:01:22.972
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
they can't Jack up people's water and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17434-1
03:01:22.972 --> 03:01:26.992
<v Ricky Horton>electricity rates because they're getting
unpopular, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17434-2
03:01:26.992 --> 03:01:32.083
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if you guys have noticed
your power bill probably went up 20%.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17434-3
03:01:32.083 --> 03:01:37.443
<v Ricky Horton>Mine personally didn't. It's not a old.
I bought a house that was grandfathered</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17434-4
03:01:37.443 --> 03:01:38.917
<v Ricky Horton>into the solar system.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17476-0
03:01:39.197 --> 03:01:42.018
<v Ricky Horton>I had to replay.
I had to redo all the solar pounds</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17476-1
03:01:42.018 --> 03:01:45.219
<v Ricky Horton>because they were so old,
but because I was a grandfather,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17476-2
03:01:45.219 --> 03:01:48.366
<v Ricky Horton>I got to keep the old crates.
So mine haven't got enough.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17476-3
03:01:48.366 --> 03:01:52.760
<v Ricky Horton>Mine is completely covered by my solar.
I just paid 30 months to stay connected,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17476-4
03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:54.117
<v Ricky Horton>but if you're not honest.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17499-0
03:01:54.317 --> 03:02:00.638
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that is approved. Yeah,
20% increase. I got, well, one did change,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17499-1
03:02:00.638 --> 03:02:06.786
<v Ricky Horton>but there is a Corporation Commission
which regulates that allow power</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17499-2
03:02:06.786 --> 03:02:09.557
<v Ricky Horton>companies to increase the rates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17509-0
03:02:14.237 --> 03:02:21.197
<v Ricky Horton>376 is that right? Oh, yeah, not not 376.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17527-0
03:02:23.797 --> 03:02:29.358
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but I think short term,
we're not there. Short term,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17527-1
03:02:29.358 --> 03:02:33.317
<v Ricky Horton>we've got to go after some parts of, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17558-0
03:02:37.357 --> 03:02:40.760
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I see.
I'm still getting my feet wet training</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17558-1
03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:44.818
<v Ricky Horton>last week, training this week.
You have to meet me as mayors.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17558-2
03:02:44.818 --> 03:02:49.466
<v Ricky Horton>I I I I actually thought there would be a
lead here both of this week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17558-3
03:02:49.466 --> 03:02:51.757
<v Ricky Horton>Did you do all your KPA stuff then?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17560-0
03:02:52.557 --> 03:02:54.197
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still not done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-0
03:02:57.037 --> 03:03:01.189
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still getting emails. Yeah, I need to.
I'm trying to figure those out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-1
03:03:01.189 --> 03:03:04.732
<v Ricky Horton>I tried to prepare a couple of them out
this morning. You know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-2
03:03:04.732 --> 03:03:07.777
<v Ricky Horton>I can tell me turn my programs.
I need like heavy bit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-3
03:03:07.777 --> 03:03:10.490
<v Ricky Horton>I have no idea about.
I've heard of the program,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-4
03:03:10.490 --> 03:03:14.034
<v Ricky Horton>but I've never used it.
So I'm gonna have to learn to use that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17603-5
03:03:14.034 --> 03:03:14.477
<v Ricky Horton>I guess.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17612-0
03:03:15.437 --> 03:03:17.687
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
some of them are not giving you access to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17612-1
03:03:17.687 --> 03:03:19.797
<v Ricky Horton>'cause the license process is too low,
yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17624-0
03:03:21.517 --> 03:03:24.517
<v Ricky Horton>Like to me,
Salesforce is what I want to look at,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17624-1
03:03:24.517 --> 03:03:27.637
<v Ricky Horton>which is all the opportunities we're
looking, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17672-0
03:03:32.877 --> 03:03:39.107
<v Ricky Horton>There's a small job that's worth looking
at that it's probably going to be one for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17672-1
03:03:39.107 --> 03:03:45.112
<v Ricky Horton>a mine and you get to look at the cycle
side of it and the heavy bit side of it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17672-2
03:03:45.112 --> 03:03:50.517
<v Ricky Horton>because I went through it with Isaac.
I was sitting in on a call, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17705-0

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17705-1
03:03:55.039 --> 03:03:59.034
<v Ricky Horton>can't even keep up with it.
But he clicked a few things and the price</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17705-2
03:03:59.034 --> 03:04:02.117
<v Ricky Horton>I got in a 70 grand and I'm like, whoa,
is that real?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17709-0
03:04:03.197 --> 03:04:05.717
<v Ricky Horton>Didn't seem like you moved that much
stuff out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17710-0
03:04:06.797 --> 03:04:07.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

03:04:18.008 --> 03:04:19.397
<v Ricky Horton>then he came back.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17734-0
03:04:20.157 --> 03:04:23.694

03:04:23.694 --> 03:04:28.117
<v Ricky Horton>I've seen people come and go back and
forth and it's there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17743-0

03:05:02.077 --> 03:05:05.933
<v Ricky Horton>The bad thing is when when we go,
then we we evaluate. It's like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/17780-1
03:05:05.933 --> 03:05:08.854

03:05:08.854 --> 03:05:11.717

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18014-0
03:08:25.037 --> 03:08:31.757
<v Ricky Horton>Say what? Yes. Oh, it's not that. Oh,
you have to work through it, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18021-0
03:08:37.917 --> 03:08:39.597
<v Ricky Horton>Did you use the PowerPoint?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18035-0
03:08:41.677 --> 03:08:48.117
<v Ricky Horton>They got a lot of programs with her.
I'm honestly, we did that. So yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18071-0
03:08:49.997 --> 03:08:58.901
<v Ricky Horton>I said if you want to take probably so
I'll you said we'll jump apart.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18071-1
03:08:58.901 --> 03:09:07.054
<v Ricky Horton>So it's very transferred a little to the
office, but it's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18071-2
03:09:07.054 --> 03:09:09.437
<v Ricky Horton>So I just take the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18105-0
03:09:09.477 --> 03:09:28.637
<v Ricky Horton>Should have called. I think it was.
I think it was standard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18153-0
03:09:46.797 --> 03:10:01.180
<v Ricky Horton>We were doing something like that,
which is completely different than doing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18153-1
03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:06.597
<v Ricky Horton>You know, we have sheets out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18175-0
03:10:06.717 --> 03:10:21.648
<v Ricky Horton>But let's say for these people, did you?
But we lost them a lot. Yeah, I was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18175-1
03:10:21.648 --> 03:10:25.477
<v Ricky Horton>I was like, I guess.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18194-0
03:10:26.077 --> 03:10:31.899
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I don't know how to do it though.
It's pretty fun. I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18194-1
03:10:31.899 --> 03:10:38.280
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to make investment. You know,
I think 10% margins in that business.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18194-2
03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:39.477
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18223-0
03:10:44.157 --> 03:10:51.508
<v Ricky Horton>So that the structural is very commodity.
It sits in as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18223-1
03:10:51.508 --> 03:10:59.215
<v Ricky Horton>So if you're going to say I was saying
70%, what's the back end?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18223-2
03:10:59.215 --> 03:11:04.077
<v Ricky Horton>I will say because they're making 20% of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18226-0
03:11:04.157 --> 03:11:06.197
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure still bad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18227-0
03:11:10.277 --> 03:11:10.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18236-0
03:11:11.357 --> 03:11:17.877
<v Ricky Horton>Something like we were doing.
That was the super album. Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18269-0
03:11:19.597 --> 03:11:28.877
<v Ricky Horton>Like we go to there are bringing along
with the impact. That's what it does.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18269-1
03:11:28.877 --> 03:11:35.385
<v Ricky Horton>We have that. That's a structure,
skeletal structure,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18269-2
03:11:35.385 --> 03:11:38.157
<v Ricky Horton>pharmacy on the inside.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18292-0
03:11:38.237 --> 03:11:48.090
<v Ricky Horton>Now that's rats in the skin.
It's got thousands of this, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18292-1
03:11:48.090 --> 03:11:56.767
<v Ricky Horton>but we erected it.
If you go inside the Phoenix Convention</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18292-2
03:11:56.767 --> 03:11:57.797
<v Ricky Horton>Center.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18314-0
03:11:58.077 --> 03:12:06.681
<v Ricky Horton>It's super, you know, feed is super cool.
Mm-hmm. So I can get in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18314-1
03:12:06.681 --> 03:12:12.928
<v Ricky Horton>I was a bit.
I was on the space only to be placed on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18314-2
03:12:12.928 --> 03:12:15.757
<v Ricky Horton>the slide. Oh, I didn't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18339-0
03:12:16.157 --> 03:12:33.317
<v Ricky Horton>We get these. We're going to, yeah,
that's what I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18358-0
03:12:43.357 --> 03:12:50.566
<v Ricky Horton>Looks better.
Almost right on 3141 versus 3244.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18358-1
03:12:50.566 --> 03:12:58.677
<v Ricky Horton>I'd probably be happy with that for now.
I'd be very.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18389-0
03:12:59.237 --> 03:13:04.536
<v Ricky Horton>Material handling, you know, whatever.
But so yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18389-1
03:13:04.536 --> 03:13:11.976
<v Ricky Horton>so cut basically needs to bump almost
double. Yeah, cut needs to double.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18389-2
03:13:11.976 --> 03:13:18.397
<v Ricky Horton>Material handling means 50% for for
giggles. Is there another?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18404-0
03:13:18.477 --> 03:13:25.975
<v Ricky Horton>Their job that we could run this against,
I know we're working on a sample size of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18404-1
03:13:25.975 --> 03:13:26.517
<v Ricky Horton>blood.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18433-0
03:13:27.997 --> 03:13:32.385
<v Ricky Horton>I was just like,
what was that other job that you, uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18433-1
03:13:32.385 --> 03:13:38.369
<v Ricky Horton>remember which one? So he pulls up a five.
He pulled up a much larger job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18433-2
03:13:38.369 --> 03:13:42.757
<v Ricky Horton>So when that when I see on page one that
had a lot of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18452-0
03:13:43.277 --> 03:13:48.763
<v Ricky Horton>I think it was TSMC.
There's a lot of TSMC guides, I'm sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18452-1
03:13:48.763 --> 03:13:53.440
<v Ricky Horton>Sent these variables,
science points it looks like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18452-2
03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:58.477
<v Ricky Horton>Is that all of this?
Is this preparing the clean noise?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18463-0
03:14:00.477 --> 03:14:11.509
<v Ricky Horton>So that's what you said. You're not.
I have a chart going some that's probably</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18463-1
03:14:11.509 --> 03:14:16.397
<v Ricky Horton>confused because or if you want to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18470-0
03:14:32.677 --> 03:14:32.997
<v Ricky Horton>Set.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18471-0
03:14:34.237 --> 03:14:34.757
<v Ricky Horton>This thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18472-0
03:14:43.757 --> 03:14:45.437
<v Ricky Horton>She I got this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18473-0
03:14:54.917 --> 03:14:55.477
<v Ricky Horton>Six.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18477-0
03:14:57.997 --> 03:15:04.677
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18481-0
03:15:13.437 --> 03:15:14.757
<v Ricky Horton>6:02 so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18482-0
03:15:21.797 --> 03:15:21.917
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18488-0
03:15:38.797 --> 03:15:41.677
<v Ricky Horton>How are you talking, Johnston?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18503-0
03:15:42.677 --> 03:15:46.160
<v Ricky Horton>We have to do a month a day until I heard
it comes here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18503-1
03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:49.277
<v Ricky Horton>I tried to I come this morning and you
got a toll.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18521-0
03:15:50.397 --> 03:15:55.357
<v Ricky Horton>They're going to see you.
I'm working on doing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18523-0
03:16:05.557 --> 03:16:06.717
<v Ricky Horton>What is it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18547-0
03:16:07.677 --> 03:16:13.102
<v Ricky Horton>It's just the whole job.
I based on my job on my walk yesterday at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18547-1
03:16:13.102 --> 03:16:17.718
<v Ricky Horton>the shop, it's like, yeah,
we have a bunch of that here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18547-2
03:16:17.718 --> 03:16:22.333
<v Ricky Horton>We just have to buy it up.
And that's just my equipment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18547-3
03:16:22.333 --> 03:16:24.277
<v Ricky Horton>You said the same thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18586-0
03:16:24.317 --> 03:16:28.089
<v Ricky Horton>They can,
but they're not based on the equipment</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18586-1
03:16:28.089 --> 03:16:32.323
<v Ricky Horton>that I see here.
It's like basically columns and bigs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18586-2
03:16:32.323 --> 03:16:36.789
<v Ricky Horton>It's like these come through.
So I may have the baseline.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18586-3
03:16:36.789 --> 03:16:41.254
<v Ricky Horton>If we if we get it,
then we're just going to talk it out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18586-4
03:16:41.254 --> 03:16:42.717
<v Ricky Horton>That's the problem.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18599-0
03:16:42.797 --> 03:16:48.190
<v Ricky Horton>We ought to have it so much.
Somebody's getting this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18599-1
03:16:48.190 --> 03:16:52.985
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's the waste.
It's in my opinion. No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18599-2
03:16:52.985 --> 03:16:58.878
<v Ricky Horton>it's the same thing I say.
I just walk in the door, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18599-3
03:16:58.878 --> 03:17:00.077
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody said.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18626-0
03:17:08.557 --> 03:17:17.437
<v Ricky Horton>We're trying to say this works.
I haven't talked to Jeff since I've been.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18626-1
03:17:17.437 --> 03:17:23.677
<v Ricky Horton>I I met him. Jeff,
John and Jimmy because it's only</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18626-2
03:17:23.677 --> 03:17:25.477
<v Ricky Horton>interviewed me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18642-0
03:17:26.037 --> 03:17:38.517
<v Ricky Horton>So I met. I had never met.
He was on my original role.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18650-0
03:17:39.837 --> 03:17:46.883
<v Ricky Horton>And my first day,
I didn't know he's in my office. Uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18650-1
03:17:46.883 --> 03:17:48.677
<v Ricky Horton>what was that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18658-0
03:17:50.877 --> 03:18:00.597
<v Ricky Horton>I don't really have, so it's so easy.
Yeah, people here most of the most of the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18686-0
03:18:01.957 --> 03:18:12.731
<v Ricky Horton>I'm supposed to be being with you,
the guys, 2 desks behind me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18686-1
03:18:12.731 --> 03:18:17.277
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know where he's at.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18689-0
03:18:17.837 --> 03:18:20.517
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18695-0
03:18:21.757 --> 03:18:26.837
<v Ricky Horton>The hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18707-0
03:18:31.437 --> 03:18:44.542
<v Ricky Horton>But what you can do is to find and
retract. I think it's like from.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18707-1
03:18:44.542 --> 03:18:50.517
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't do that. I'm not sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18731-0
03:18:51.077 --> 03:19:04.717
<v Ricky Horton>Where they have they they got a shot of
premaged panel A and installed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18761-0
03:19:05.597 --> 03:19:14.756
<v Ricky Horton>And I I didn't know what they could do
here, what they could do here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18761-1
03:19:14.756 --> 03:19:21.037
<v Ricky Horton>I'm in the middle of helping the field
install.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18805-0
03:19:31.517 --> 03:19:37.848
<v Ricky Horton>But they want it installed.
So this all if you didn't deal with it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18805-1
03:19:37.848 --> 03:19:43.527
<v Ricky Horton>it's kind of paying it down.
So that's when it is, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18805-2
03:19:43.527 --> 03:19:47.717
<v Ricky Horton>if you see now,
I'm trying to help them get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18826-0
03:19:48.997 --> 03:19:55.305
<v Ricky Horton>Interesting. Yeah.
So I got to get some coupons.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18826-1
03:19:55.305 --> 03:20:03.673
<v Ricky Horton>So I've got to do it.
We've got to come from all the other guys.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18826-2
03:20:03.673 --> 03:20:08.437
<v Ricky Horton>What the hell is going to happen? OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18859-0
03:20:08.797 --> 03:20:15.817
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's not.
I wonder if it's five in the end,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18859-1
03:20:15.817 --> 03:20:24.997
<v Ricky Horton>but but I get to the report that shows
it's less than or something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18879-0
03:20:25.517 --> 03:20:30.043
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see that it's OK,
one by number of opportunities and OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18879-1
03:20:30.043 --> 03:20:33.851
<v Ricky Horton>one by no,
it comes straight up to sales stores. Oh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18879-2
03:20:33.851 --> 03:20:38.018
<v Ricky Horton>really? That's right. That's all I did.
I won't give you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18879-3
03:20:38.018 --> 03:20:43.910
<v Ricky Horton>I need to back them to that. All right.
I have a different right to answer points</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18879-4
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:44.557
<v Ricky Horton>and Jeff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18881-0
03:20:45.997 --> 03:20:53.117
<v Ricky Horton>Now you can see what the difference is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18907-0
03:20:54.837 --> 03:21:00.117
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I need your list of.
This is what we want. Negotiation. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18907-1
03:21:00.117 --> 03:21:04.437
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want that? Sure.
I'll send you a copy. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18907-2
03:21:04.437 --> 03:21:11.077
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just getting along with this couch.
Yeah, I'm just getting myself on the list.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18912-0
03:21:11.277 --> 03:21:15.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18923-0
03:21:24.637 --> 03:21:44.357
<v Ricky Horton>That's the only process I can see myself.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18936-0
03:21:44.477 --> 03:21:47.428
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry.
Did you get a chance to get the new</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18936-1
03:21:47.428 --> 03:21:49.877
<v Ricky Horton>account? All right, that's the way out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18956-0
03:21:51.237 --> 03:22:04.877
<v Ricky Horton>It's got no question.
I miss that question.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/18960-0
03:22:05.917 --> 03:22:10.197
<v Ricky Horton>That's like the visit to the. That's fine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19010-0
03:22:12.477 --> 03:22:19.481
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So how do I say it's where I use the,
I'll go to the additional labour and I'll</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19010-1
03:22:19.481 --> 03:22:25.819
<v Ricky Horton>figure out what the development is and
then I'll the if the part's the same</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19010-2
03:22:25.819 --> 03:22:32.157
<v Ricky Horton>project and I'll figure out the 12 hours
and then I'll plug it in the hour.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19023-0
03:22:32.237 --> 03:22:40.037
<v Ricky Horton>That's right. That's well. Well,
it's time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19035-0
03:22:40.797 --> 03:22:44.241
<v Ricky Horton>But it's right.
It's probably shouldn't be Fed up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19035-1
03:22:44.241 --> 03:22:47.077
<v Ricky Horton>Fed up looks way up proportion the way to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19043-0
03:23:03.397 --> 03:23:04.517
<v Ricky Horton>Trips.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19047-0
03:23:07.277 --> 03:23:08.837
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that'll make a difference.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19060-0
03:23:10.517 --> 03:23:19.117
<v Ricky Horton>I was going to say that that made my
heart skip a beat. OK, that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19065-0
03:23:32.677 --> 03:23:36.357
<v Ricky Horton>You're preparing another one then? Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19068-0
03:23:37.717 --> 03:23:40.877
<v Ricky Horton>This is one that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19085-0
03:23:52.197 --> 03:24:06.157
<v Ricky Horton>So handling was 69 and 75.
That was at 46 or 59 so I.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19124-0
03:24:07.037 --> 03:24:13.968
<v Ricky Horton>18113 So I thought close it here.
It's at 78. It said 69.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19124-1
03:24:13.968 --> 03:24:19.226
<v Ricky Horton>It was 8855 plus the 40s that was about
28.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19124-2
03:24:19.226 --> 03:24:26.397
<v Ricky Horton>Let me let me get these while we're here.
Hang on a second.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19166-0
03:24:26.797 --> 03:24:30.062
<v Ricky Horton>You, you,
you're going to get individual jobs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19166-1
03:24:30.062 --> 03:24:34.023
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, yeah,
he doesn't know how to do the jobs in I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19166-2
03:24:34.023 --> 03:24:37.427
<v Ricky Horton>believe,
but is that what it it actually took to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19166-3
03:24:37.427 --> 03:24:41.735
<v Ricky Horton>do those jobs? I can take,
I can take a look and see where we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19166-4
03:24:41.735 --> 03:24:44.237
<v Ricky Horton>finished out for actual on this one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19202-0
03:24:44.717 --> 03:24:50.138
<v Ricky Horton>But this is that it's on the screen now
on the left, the one that's on the left,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19202-1
03:24:50.138 --> 03:24:55.493
<v Ricky Horton>that's what they released as both. Oh, OK,
so that's basically that's. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19202-2
03:24:55.493 --> 03:24:58.706
<v Ricky Horton>that was,
I'm pretty sure with this one we were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19202-3
03:24:58.706 --> 03:25:01.317
<v Ricky Horton>provided with the total hours and said.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19228-0
03:25:01.677 --> 03:25:07.801
<v Ricky Horton>Put it right out together kind of like
this. They gave us,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19228-1
03:25:07.801 --> 03:25:12.680
<v Ricky Horton>they gave us one lump sum and said to get
out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19228-2
03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:19.117
<v Ricky Horton>So this would have been another one that
would have appeared.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19241-0
03:25:19.837 --> 03:25:25.243
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, one of our estimators. Yeah,
so and this will let us.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19241-1
03:25:25.243 --> 03:25:30.837
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't trust that as much as the one
that I trust from.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19276-0
03:25:32.237 --> 03:25:39.589
<v Ricky Horton>No, the guy he worked with here, he said.
He's at the meeting today for LLC.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19276-1
03:25:39.589 --> 03:25:47.133
<v Ricky Horton>I'm guessing we should trust Parks more
because he's out here with him all the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19276-2
03:25:47.133 --> 03:25:51.717
<v Ricky Horton>time. He knows much back to Katie, right?
Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19286-0
03:25:52.157 --> 03:25:58.412
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so this one,
every pretty much every single one of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19286-1
03:25:58.412 --> 03:26:00.717
<v Ricky Horton>these packages, they.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19342-0
03:26:01.677 --> 03:26:07.217
<v Ricky Horton>They originally bid the project at
quarter inch across the board.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19342-1
03:26:07.217 --> 03:26:14.017
<v Ricky Horton>We got the final drawing set and all of
the weldments switched to 516 instead of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19342-2
03:26:14.017 --> 03:26:18.047
<v Ricky Horton>board.
So all things were reestimated before we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19342-3
03:26:18.047 --> 03:26:21.237
<v Ricky Horton>sent them on to the floor just to see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19380-0
03:26:21.677 --> 03:26:25.337
<v Ricky Horton>To make sure we weren't going to bust it.
If we're going to bust it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19380-1
03:26:25.337 --> 03:26:29.581
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to try and get ahead of it
and say here's where it is going to take</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19380-2
03:26:29.581 --> 03:26:33.666
<v Ricky Horton>us. If it's over a certain dollar amount,
then we're going to see, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19380-3
03:26:33.666 --> 03:26:36.637
<v Ricky Horton>he's estimating or tracking the cost in
some some form.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19422-0
03:26:37.117 --> 03:26:43.449
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that was kind of the process
with Pawson's to get them in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19422-1
03:26:43.449 --> 03:26:50.791
<v Ricky Horton>I reestimated them before they got put
out on the floor and then and then we go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19422-2
03:26:50.791 --> 03:26:55.380
<v Ricky Horton>from there.
So so the the mix between your fifth,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19422-3
03:26:55.380 --> 03:26:56.757
<v Ricky Horton>Weld and other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19439-0
03:26:58.517 --> 03:27:02.827
<v Ricky Horton>Is essentially what the fit and Weld is
over here, but yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19439-1
03:27:02.827 --> 03:27:08.197
<v Ricky Horton>it depends on what your other should be,
what bucket it should be in, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19469-0
03:27:11.597 --> 03:27:16.911
<v Ricky Horton>But you're essentially the same.
I should have on that last one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19469-1
03:27:16.911 --> 03:27:20.917
<v Ricky Horton>I should have recorded that as on that
last job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19469-2
03:27:20.917 --> 03:27:26.477
<v Ricky Horton>I should have recorded that as well.
Can we get back and redo that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19503-0
03:27:26.837 --> 03:27:31.308
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah,
the person that we were adjusting off of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19503-1
03:27:31.308 --> 03:27:35.449
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry,
I should have grabbed it while we were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19503-2
03:27:35.449 --> 03:27:39.258
<v Ricky Horton>there.
That way we can look at 234K of these,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19503-3
03:27:39.258 --> 03:27:42.157
<v Ricky Horton>whatever we want to look at to see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19507-0
03:27:42.517 --> 03:27:45.517
<v Ricky Horton>Do we see consistent spray in there? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19512-0
03:27:46.477 --> 03:27:49.117
<v Ricky Horton>We haven't looked at actual hours yet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19536-0
03:27:49.997 --> 03:27:53.302
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, the other ones from Mark yesterday.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19536-1
03:27:53.302 --> 03:27:58.690
<v Ricky Horton>but all the way to supposed those are
supposed actual hours that have been</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19536-2
03:27:58.690 --> 03:28:04.509
<v Ricky Horton>docked because the guys didn't have that
induced that they put their time on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19536-3
03:28:04.509 --> 03:28:04.797
<v Ricky Horton>job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19569-0
03:28:12.557 --> 03:28:18.273
<v Ricky Horton>It sounds like Chris is probably getting
tasked with making sure these numbers are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19569-1
03:28:18.273 --> 03:28:22.680
<v Ricky Horton>right, the items in here,
so that you can eventually say, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19569-2
03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:25.917
<v Ricky Horton>these are good now,
let's push it out all the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19602-0
03:28:26.837 --> 03:28:32.256
<v Ricky Horton>I like what he said he wants.
He also wants to be actionable of hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19602-1
03:28:32.256 --> 03:28:37.675
<v Ricky Horton>You and I both agree with this.
The whole business has to go on actual</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19602-2
03:28:37.675 --> 03:28:41.797
<v Ricky Horton>hours. Yeah, once you have it,
you can start working.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19622-0
03:28:42.077 --> 03:28:48.214
<v Ricky Horton>Which helps, you know,
fix it by trying to get better. Sorry,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19622-1
03:28:48.214 --> 03:28:54.252
<v Ricky Horton>it's reduces the wrong emotions. OK,
this is the right data,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19622-2
03:28:54.252 --> 03:28:57.717
<v Ricky Horton>but I put the wrong shot. OK, cool.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19625-0
03:28:57.757 --> 03:29:00.037
<v Ricky Horton>It's this. This is our.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19627-0
03:29:04.477 --> 03:29:05.717
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19632-0
03:29:08.317 --> 03:29:10.197
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, 150, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19641-0
03:29:30.277 --> 03:29:33.957
<v Ricky Horton>And then had that, uh, 6144.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19645-0
03:29:37.357 --> 03:29:41.597
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's a service.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19677-0
03:29:43.717 --> 03:29:48.152
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So do you,
do you have a snippet of that that you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19677-1
03:29:48.152 --> 03:29:54.969
<v Ricky Horton>just showed of what the job really belong
to that? This is just for these. Oh, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19677-2
03:29:54.969 --> 03:29:58.747
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
this this one is really the last one we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19677-3
03:29:58.747 --> 03:30:02.197
<v Ricky Horton>were looking at that I can, I can pull up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19684-0
03:30:04.917 --> 03:30:08.877
<v Ricky Horton>That I can pull up will be so this one
299.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19695-0
03:30:12.437 --> 03:30:20.637
<v Ricky Horton>You're gonna give us the actual one now
then? Yeah. So I'll pull up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19700-0
03:30:22.517 --> 03:30:26.277
<v Ricky Horton>Take the details for this one again,
so the screenshot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19717-0
03:30:33.197 --> 03:30:38.637
<v Ricky Horton>382 is, yeah, total. Yeah.
What's what's correct? Yeah. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19717-1
03:30:38.637 --> 03:30:41.357
<v Ricky Horton>everyone did that. What is it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19742-0
03:30:42.317 --> 03:30:50.016
<v Ricky Horton>The other one had coding time that we
have in the county for both of that time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19742-1
03:30:50.016 --> 03:30:55.213
<v Ricky Horton>Well, we're talking about it. OK,
so in B3 right now,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19742-2
03:30:55.213 --> 03:30:58.197
<v Ricky Horton>that's the lines were 3320 and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19755-0
03:30:58.637 --> 03:31:10.677
<v Ricky Horton>And the actually was when these was so
and then if I go back in here and I go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19756-0
03:31:12.557 --> 03:31:12.797
<v Ricky Horton>7.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19758-0
03:31:15.157 --> 03:31:16.917
<v Ricky Horton>Here, here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19789-0
03:31:21.757 --> 03:31:32.100
<v Ricky Horton>What's that? I'm not too certain.
I think they're following. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19789-1
03:31:32.100 --> 03:31:41.517
<v Ricky Horton>they're starting to try and I think
they're using heavy bid.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19821-0
03:31:42.637 --> 03:31:46.827
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.
This is pure speculation at this moment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19821-1
03:31:46.827 --> 03:31:51.097
<v Ricky Horton>The one that I'm curious about is the
Blofield shop,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19821-2
03:31:51.097 --> 03:31:57.462
<v Ricky Horton>because it's such a mechanical shop that
I'd be surprised if they don't have a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19821-3
03:31:57.462 --> 03:31:59.477
<v Ricky Horton>piping package estimator.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19828-0
03:32:00.637 --> 03:32:04.197
<v Ricky Horton>So let's just where we finish with
actions.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19847-0
03:32:08.637 --> 03:32:16.450
<v Ricky Horton>Total. We finished 10 weeks,
just under 10 hours under the original</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19847-1
03:32:16.450 --> 03:32:21.277
<v Ricky Horton>budget. It's 299. Well, we used 86 versus.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19854-0
03:32:31.037 --> 03:32:32.677
<v Ricky Horton>Of course, it's gonna be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19863-0
03:32:40.917 --> 03:32:49.077
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
previous 86 and we had 88 in this is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19866-0
03:32:55.997 --> 03:32:56.437
<v Ricky Horton>And uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19876-0
03:32:57.677 --> 03:33:04.677
<v Ricky Horton>71.7578 looks perfect. That's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19886-0
03:33:05.997 --> 03:33:14.797
<v Ricky Horton>We use 45.2546 burn. We use 17.75.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19887-0
03:33:16.437 --> 03:33:16.997
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19912-0
03:33:19.837 --> 03:33:28.043
<v Ricky Horton>Every bid versus Aqua, they say. And yeah,
the tech was way better for the structure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19912-1
03:33:28.043 --> 03:33:33.864
<v Ricky Horton>It's basically simple for several
contractors. That's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19912-2
03:33:33.864 --> 03:33:35.677
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't know that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19943-0
03:33:36.557 --> 03:33:43.584
<v Ricky Horton>If I look that up after looking at that,
why would they be easy to begin with?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19943-1
03:33:43.584 --> 03:33:49.189
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. Interesting.
They're feeding structural into it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19943-2
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:53.637
<v Ricky Horton>I think that low row middle of field
stuff, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19950-0
03:33:54.237 --> 03:33:59.517
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I don't have the history yet,
but I'm working on getting it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19987-0
03:34:01.917 --> 03:34:04.975
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
I think power fab technically is going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19987-1
03:34:04.975 --> 03:34:09.855
<v Ricky Horton>be everything that structural it just
drives and even that electrical that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19987-2
03:34:09.855 --> 03:34:14.931
<v Ricky Horton>you're talking about be able to push.
Why aren't we going to do that today or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19987-3
03:34:14.931 --> 03:34:15.517
<v Ricky Horton>tomorrow?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/19995-0
03:34:16.517 --> 03:34:22.477
<v Ricky Horton>What's your actual on the 25060948?
Do you have that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20013-0
03:34:27.717 --> 03:34:33.220
<v Ricky Horton>That's the first one.
That's the second one. The one. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20013-1
03:34:33.220 --> 03:34:39.457
<v Ricky Horton>that one there. This one.
This one was just released for production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20013-2
03:34:39.457 --> 03:34:42.117
<v Ricky Horton>today. Oh, OK, because, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20028-0
03:34:43.317 --> 03:34:50.827
<v Ricky Horton>Can I do do one additional project with
both international? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20028-1
03:34:50.827 --> 03:34:56.517
<v Ricky Horton>or do 40 whatever, you know,
the more the better.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20046-0
03:36:17.477 --> 03:36:19.997
<v Ricky Horton>740, I think, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20052-0
03:36:53.437 --> 03:36:54.117
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20065-0
03:36:55.517 --> 03:37:04.757
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla's hours are total of 58 budget
being non 69. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20071-0
03:37:09.877 --> 03:37:13.637
<v Ricky Horton>We're kind of going all over here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20098-0
03:37:19.277 --> 03:37:25.408
<v Ricky Horton>No, they're not.
So like as an example on the 240758 fit</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20098-1
03:37:25.408 --> 03:37:32.077
<v Ricky Horton>up and weld are basically right between
Tekla and the budget.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20105-0
03:37:34.477 --> 03:37:39.477
<v Ricky Horton>The last one we looked at 2506-0948. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20147-0
03:37:43.197 --> 03:37:50.021
<v Ricky Horton>It's pretty close between fit up and weld
it it's there's a little slight</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20147-1
03:37:50.021 --> 03:37:54.447
<v Ricky Horton>difference.
The two front this one is there's a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20147-2
03:37:54.447 --> 03:38:01.917
<v Ricky Horton>forty-eight percent difference between
Weld and a 20% difference between fit up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20155-0
03:38:01.917 --> 03:38:04.357
<v Ricky Horton>And if we look at handling cut burn.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20190-0
03:38:06.917 --> 03:38:12.838
<v Ricky Horton>So just handling one job is 8.
78 high in Tekla,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20190-1
03:38:12.838 --> 03:38:19.605
<v Ricky Horton>30% low on the next job in Tekla,
20% high on this job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20190-2
03:38:19.605 --> 03:38:24.197
<v Ricky Horton>That's a nice average. Yeah, that was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20248-0
03:38:24.717 --> 03:38:30.617
<v Ricky Horton>30% high on the first one,
53% low on the second one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20248-1
03:38:30.617 --> 03:38:37.281
<v Ricky Horton>112% high on the next one.
Burn is 34% low on the first one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20248-2
03:38:37.281 --> 03:38:43.837
<v Ricky Horton>1% high on the second one,
28% low on the on the third one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20285-0
03:38:44.317 --> 03:38:49.093
<v Ricky Horton>But it's all the same families of jobs.
Are you basically making things with flag</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20285-1
03:38:49.093 --> 03:38:51.831
<v Ricky Horton>plates here?
Are they different types of jobs?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20285-2
03:38:51.831 --> 03:38:55.442
<v Ricky Horton>This one and the first one are very
similar to both of those.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20285-3
03:38:55.442 --> 03:39:00.277
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds like the birds in one place were
lacking the other three in the middle way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20313-0
03:39:00.317 --> 03:39:05.816
<v Ricky Horton>That that T6 one,
the one we did in the middle, that one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20313-1
03:39:05.816 --> 03:39:13.117
<v Ricky Horton>the one that we looked in actuals is a
mixture of structural as well as some</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20313-2
03:39:13.117 --> 03:39:15.677
<v Ricky Horton>miscellaneous. So it's got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20344-0
03:39:16.237 --> 03:39:20.001
<v Ricky Horton>Angles, gust of plates,
a bunch of little stuff,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20344-1
03:39:20.001 --> 03:39:24.534
<v Ricky Horton>and this is mostly easy columns. Yeah,
because in my mind,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20344-2
03:39:24.534 --> 03:39:30.757
<v Ricky Horton>if you start mixing handrail with beads
and columns, it's a good universe, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20357-0
03:39:33.037 --> 03:39:36.422
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
And and and some of these are pretty</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20357-1
03:39:36.422 --> 03:39:40.594
<v Ricky Horton>small too,
so we'll see a little bit of a wide road.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20357-2
03:39:40.594 --> 03:39:45.317
<v Ricky Horton>I'd want to see a bunch of jobs in 500
hours or more, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20385-0
03:39:48.117 --> 03:39:56.540
<v Ricky Horton>And if we want, let's see,
we can keep it on the same scale of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20385-1
03:39:56.540 --> 03:40:02.197
<v Ricky Horton>758 project,
which is structural and a small</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20385-2
03:40:02.197 --> 03:40:06.597
<v Ricky Horton>anonymously is in one package 7581.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20415-0
03:40:13.197 --> 03:40:17.829
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't say anything that makes me
want to say,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20415-1
03:40:17.829 --> 03:40:25.186
<v Ricky Horton>we'll need to change this by this. Yeah.
The only thing I saw that you just read</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20415-2
03:40:25.186 --> 03:40:29.637
<v Ricky Horton>out was we were low level of burns, right?
Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20431-0
03:40:32.997 --> 03:40:39.657
<v Ricky Horton>On, yeah,
essentially that middle job was about the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20431-1
03:40:39.657 --> 03:40:45.037
<v Ricky Horton>same, but there's a rounds of it use that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20441-0
03:40:54.277 --> 03:40:58.113
<v Ricky Horton>And you know,
I I know if if Mark's doing this split,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20441-1
03:40:58.113 --> 03:40:58.397
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20478-0
03:40:59.677 --> 03:41:04.068
<v Ricky Horton>I get his experience, he's got it right.
He's happening every day,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20478-1
03:41:04.068 --> 03:41:07.935
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm going to put a little bit more
weight on the tech,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20478-2
03:41:07.935 --> 03:41:11.934
<v Ricky Horton>but from the standpoint of it's going to
be very consistent,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20478-3
03:41:11.934 --> 03:41:15.277
<v Ricky Horton>whereas he's going to flip the drawings
and get a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20483-0
03:41:15.437 --> 03:41:17.717
<v Ricky Horton>General theory, right?
And so I'll go with.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20532-0
03:41:21.277 --> 03:41:26.756
<v Ricky Horton>If if if I see some slight variation
there and then it's because of his, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20532-1
03:41:26.756 --> 03:41:30.155
<v Ricky Horton>the way,
I shouldn't say the way the wind blows.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20532-2
03:41:30.155 --> 03:41:35.149
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know it's more than that,
but he's not looking at every cut and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20532-3
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:39.034
<v Ricky Horton>every everything.
So you're taking that with a grain of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20532-4
03:41:39.034 --> 03:41:39.797
<v Ricky Horton>salt, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20571-0
03:41:40.237 --> 03:41:43.235
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, a lot of,
I don't know if you tell me,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20571-1
03:41:43.235 --> 03:41:48.020
<v Ricky Horton>but a lot of structure is either dollar
per pound or dollar per ton. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20571-2
03:41:48.020 --> 03:41:52.358
<v Ricky Horton>a lot of people bid like that.
I don't like it, but they do. To me,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20571-3
03:41:52.358 --> 03:41:57.398
<v Ricky Horton>it's like you start out with the hours
and things really going to take and the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20571-4
03:41:57.398 --> 03:41:57.717
<v Ricky Horton>cost.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20583-0
03:41:57.997 --> 03:42:01.265
<v Ricky Horton>And then you look and say, oh, OK,
about how many,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20583-1
03:42:01.265 --> 03:42:03.957
<v Ricky Horton>how much money is that per time per pound?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20623-0
03:42:05.557 --> 03:42:10.786
<v Ricky Horton>Why is this one higher than the norm?
Or why is this one lower than the norm?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20623-1
03:42:10.786 --> 03:42:14.876
<v Ricky Horton>Because it's important.
I use 30 lbs per man hour for what I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20623-2
03:42:14.876 --> 03:42:19.703
<v Ricky Horton>would call our standard work.
I've done the same thing. I was like, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20623-3
03:42:19.703 --> 03:42:24.597
<v Ricky Horton>it's just to get your thumb in here with
that. It's like if you see 100.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20626-0
03:42:24.997 --> 03:42:28.517
<v Ricky Horton>What it is?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20634-0
03:42:32.797 --> 03:42:37.309
<v Ricky Horton>But that doesn't work for structure.
It didn't work for duct tape chutes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20634-1
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.797
<v Ricky Horton>hoppers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20645-0
03:42:43.357 --> 03:42:48.699
<v Ricky Horton>That other fuel gets used a lot,
so that's kind of throwing a bug in this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20645-1
03:42:48.699 --> 03:42:49.277
<v Ricky Horton>as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20657-0
03:42:56.357 --> 03:43:01.157
<v Ricky Horton>Because that's a fifth of the hours on
this job. Yeah, no.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20673-0
03:43:18.517 --> 03:43:29.437
<v Ricky Horton>16 well at 3 foot 10.6.
So then I took the .6 and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20677-0
03:43:30.557 --> 03:43:33.677
<v Ricky Horton>Let me please say it doesn't jive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20710-0
03:43:35.917 --> 03:43:43.979
<v Ricky Horton>Is it's changed at this point.
So these estimators looks like it ought</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20710-1
03:43:43.979 --> 03:43:52.837
<v Ricky Horton>to be in fit up because weld on this job.
Tekla was higher on by 38% and the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20749-0
03:43:53.477 --> 03:43:57.517
<v Ricky Horton>Fit up was way under,
probably because using the A reason</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20749-1
03:43:57.517 --> 03:44:02.044
<v Ricky Horton>during the manual manipulation down there,
you don't get fed up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20749-2
03:44:02.044 --> 03:44:06.433
<v Ricky Horton>So I would bet that goes in. In fact,
I won't put it in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20749-3
03:44:06.433 --> 03:44:09.637
<v Ricky Horton>The other part is it's it's also odd
because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20774-0
03:44:10.077 --> 03:44:15.780
<v Ricky Horton>We adjusted our Weld rate and I
calculated these wells.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20774-1
03:44:15.780 --> 03:44:22.909
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially this was 516 Weldman,
3 foot 10 of well, which is now .6,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20774-2
03:44:22.909 --> 03:44:24.437
<v Ricky Horton>whereas before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20817-0
03:44:26.517 --> 03:44:30.479
<v Ricky Horton>It was 1.
2 OK and then so my hours per piece,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20817-1
03:44:30.479 --> 03:44:36.212
<v Ricky Horton>all these 1.2 is another .
6 and these are all under that should be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20817-2
03:44:36.212 --> 03:44:40.005
<v Ricky Horton>cut.
These are all under the other category.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20817-3
03:44:40.005 --> 03:44:44.052
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's the hours per piece falls into the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20817-4
03:44:44.052 --> 03:44:45.317
<v Ricky Horton>other category.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20846-0
03:44:45.757 --> 03:44:51.743
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially when I was estimating these
and they gave me hey now you need this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20846-1
03:44:51.743 --> 03:44:56.441
<v Ricky Horton>estimate for two hours.
This is how much I need time based on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20846-2
03:44:56.441 --> 03:44:59.927
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla.
Now I can go in here and globally edit</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20846-3
03:44:59.927 --> 03:45:00.837
<v Ricky Horton>that pieces.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20848-0
03:45:01.397 --> 03:45:01.797
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20867-0
03:45:03.757 --> 03:45:09.325
<v Ricky Horton>Not, you know, a little bit more actual,
but because it's hours per piece,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20867-1
03:45:09.325 --> 03:45:13.557
<v Ricky Horton>our metrics that we've changed, yeah,
change that, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20868-0
03:45:15.157 --> 03:45:15.477
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20881-0
03:45:18.437 --> 03:45:23.317
<v Ricky Horton>So that is one thing in skewed the other
categories in skewed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20884-0
03:45:24.717 --> 03:45:26.277
<v Ricky Horton>There is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20890-0
03:45:31.277 --> 03:45:33.197
<v Ricky Horton>Really zero patterns.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20922-0
03:45:34.877 --> 03:45:43.622
<v Ricky Horton>So like burn on this one was pretty close.
I mean right almost 18.69 versus 18,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20922-1
03:45:43.622 --> 03:45:50.837
<v Ricky Horton>whereas burn on the others one was 28%
under, 1% over, 34% under.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20927-0
03:45:55.757 --> 03:45:59.557
<v Ricky Horton>There's just no pattern whatsoever. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20934-0
03:46:13.557 --> 03:46:15.517
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I think it's gonna be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20973-0
03:46:16.477 --> 03:46:20.690
<v Ricky Horton>I mean the word hundreds.
I think it's also going to be the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20973-1
03:46:20.690 --> 03:46:24.973
<v Ricky Horton>hundreds ones driven by Mark and the ones
driven by Gilbert.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20973-2
03:46:24.973 --> 03:46:30.169
<v Ricky Horton>Because if you start mixing those,
you're going to have less. Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20973-3
03:46:30.169 --> 03:46:35.295
<v Ricky Horton>I think you're you're right. Well,
in all of these instances over years,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/20973-4
03:46:35.295 --> 03:46:35.717
<v Ricky Horton>right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21020-0
03:46:35.997 --> 03:46:40.870
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, these were, these were mine,
but it's really the actuals, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21020-1
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:45.194
<v Ricky Horton>The actuals should still be the actuals,
be the actuals. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21020-2
03:46:45.194 --> 03:46:49.106
<v Ricky Horton>you have actuals on 247 about 8.
That's what I do. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21020-3
03:46:49.106 --> 03:46:54.871
<v Ricky Horton>it's the actuals in the 566. That's the.
Are you charging, charging yourself? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21020-4
03:46:54.871 --> 03:46:55.077
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21060-0
03:46:56.917 --> 03:47:02.543
<v Ricky Horton>And you have it by job. Yeah. OK, good.
And the 566 was supplied by Gilbert.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21060-1
03:47:02.543 --> 03:47:07.584
<v Ricky Horton>So we were held to their dollar amount to
be supplied that breakout.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21060-2
03:47:07.584 --> 03:47:13.357
<v Ricky Horton>I estimated it half year just so that we
could see if we would go over or not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21069-0
03:47:13.437 --> 03:47:17.495
<v Ricky Horton>How to do, you know,
I guess we'll see you in a second,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21069-1
03:47:17.495 --> 03:47:20.757
<v Ricky Horton>historically and guess we're around
*******.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21070-0
03:47:23.477 --> 03:47:24.317
<v Ricky Horton>And then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21071-0
03:47:30.957 --> 03:47:32.517
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21072-0
03:47:35.077 --> 03:47:35.557
<v Ricky Horton>Hey.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21077-0
03:47:38.197 --> 03:47:40.517
<v Ricky Horton>I'm good at what you're so sorry.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21078-0
03:47:43.837 --> 03:47:43.957
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21080-0
03:47:47.677 --> 03:47:48.837
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, Sir.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21082-0
03:47:57.397 --> 03:47:57.557
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21083-0
03:48:00.117 --> 03:48:01.077
<v Ricky Horton>Pause.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21101-0
03:48:06.877 --> 03:48:15.530
<v Ricky Horton>Perfect. I uh, I will make sure that uh,
that you are doing and we'll get you 1040.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21101-1
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:17.797
<v Ricky Horton>That's all right, Sir.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21102-0
03:48:19.117 --> 03:48:20.437
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21114-0
03:48:23.037 --> 03:48:26.530
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, Sir. Yeah,
go ahead and get started on them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21114-1
03:48:26.530 --> 03:48:28.557
<v Ricky Horton>That'll give me a head on my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21116-0
03:48:32.117 --> 03:48:33.197
<v Ricky Horton>So thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21117-0
03:48:34.797 --> 03:48:35.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21122-0
03:48:40.157 --> 03:48:44.877
<v Ricky Horton>So that particular lot is what we're
talking about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21123-0
03:48:48.597 --> 03:48:48.917
<v Ricky Horton>To.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21126-0
03:48:50.477 --> 03:48:52.157
<v Ricky Horton>But then we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21150-0
03:48:53.237 --> 03:49:01.664
<v Ricky Horton>One and then when we go in here,
we have sequence 3 level one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21150-1
03:49:01.664 --> 03:49:09.957
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see a sequence 3 level 2.
So I guess this is the log.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21172-0
03:49:17.597 --> 03:49:27.246
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's handling at zero,
but we have 96 plan hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21172-1
03:49:27.246 --> 03:49:31.037
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks to the project.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21175-0
03:49:34.957 --> 03:49:36.397
<v Ricky Horton>So I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21178-0
03:49:37.677 --> 03:49:39.277
<v Ricky Horton>This production still.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21181-0
03:49:42.117 --> 03:49:43.637
<v Ricky Horton>So that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21191-0
03:49:45.597 --> 03:49:54.757
<v Ricky Horton>That's 5 minutes moving to based on that.
She is less than five.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21210-0
03:49:56.557 --> 03:50:02.850
<v Ricky Horton>We have 13567,
so is this one big job and we're just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21210-1
03:50:02.850 --> 03:50:11.637
<v Ricky Horton>looking at where pieces of this one big
tab? That's what I'm going to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21220-0
03:50:15.437 --> 03:50:18.237
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, there's so much data here. I mean,
I see 600, 370.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21227-0
03:50:21.437 --> 03:50:24.677
<v Ricky Horton>1800 There's a lot of data here, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21229-0
03:50:27.477 --> 03:50:29.237
<v Ricky Horton>It'd be nice to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21238-0
03:50:30.397 --> 03:50:37.237
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if you can dump it all in
one bell swoop into Excel.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21245-0
03:50:49.837 --> 03:50:54.317
<v Ricky Horton>Like those budget numbers don't match
well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21250-0
03:50:56.637 --> 03:50:59.117
<v Ricky Horton>Show them here either.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21255-0
03:51:00.477 --> 03:51:02.997
<v Ricky Horton>close adjustments.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21256-0
03:51:04.677 --> 03:51:04.917
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21265-0
03:51:09.957 --> 03:51:13.197
<v Ricky Horton>What we were saying the other day was
that was the estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21282-0
03:51:13.837 --> 03:51:18.099
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I'm saying.
It doesn't match this, but then there's,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21282-1
03:51:18.099 --> 03:51:21.837
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I see three,
I see base adjustment plan regular.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21312-0
03:51:23.277 --> 03:51:26.603
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, see,
there's there's actually an estimated</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21312-1
03:51:26.603 --> 03:51:31.831
<v Ricky Horton>hours field as well that lay in this.
That's where I wasn't expecting to see</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21312-2
03:51:31.831 --> 03:51:35.565
<v Ricky Horton>the estimate,
but they were saying they were using the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21312-3
03:51:35.565 --> 03:51:38.077
<v Ricky Horton>adjustment for the estimated so plan.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21316-0
03:51:38.477 --> 03:51:40.917
<v Ricky Horton>Is the sum of adjustment plus base.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21317-0
03:51:42.597 --> 03:51:42.917
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21319-0
03:51:45.837 --> 03:51:48.917
<v Ricky Horton>Time track machine so severe.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21324-0
03:51:49.997 --> 03:51:53.477
<v Ricky Horton>So she did before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21329-0
03:52:20.037 --> 03:52:20.357
<v Ricky Horton>We.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21334-0
03:52:56.637 --> 03:52:56.837
<v Ricky Horton>3.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21335-0
03:53:01.117 --> 03:53:02.637
<v Ricky Horton>I'm from North Florida.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21336-0
03:53:03.597 --> 03:53:05.557
<v Ricky Horton>Is it a?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21353-0
03:53:23.037 --> 03:53:27.651
<v Ricky Horton>Surprised to send this in the e-mail.
It'd be like you'd send a spreadsheet and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21353-1
03:53:27.651 --> 03:53:30.997
<v Ricky Horton>say here it is this.
I would assume that Tekla was baked.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21362-0
03:53:32.077 --> 03:53:37.877
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's got the,
it's got it laid out the schedule.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21369-0
03:53:40.397 --> 03:53:44.797
<v Ricky Horton>Instead of typing this every week, yeah,
just having that as a report.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21375-0
03:53:46.557 --> 03:53:50.997
<v Ricky Horton>Estimate versus actual bunch of jobs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21380-0
03:54:08.997 --> 03:54:10.677
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21394-0
03:54:51.837 --> 03:54:54.717
<v Ricky Horton>How in the world does it let you have the
same sheet name?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21400-0
03:55:01.197 --> 03:55:04.677
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm saying that was answered the
question.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21436-0
03:55:05.917 --> 03:55:09.997
<v Ricky Horton>I'm also all of these.
They said that we have one sheet in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21436-1
03:55:09.997 --> 03:55:13.559
<v Ricky Horton>folder that we constantly we just keep
adding ages to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21436-2
03:55:13.559 --> 03:55:17.185
<v Ricky Horton>So each of those is the job number on the
bottom. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21436-3
03:55:17.185 --> 03:55:20.488
<v Ricky Horton>we did the job number at the bottom.
It's regular.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21436-4
03:55:20.488 --> 03:55:24.957
<v Ricky Horton>It's lots of associated with it and then
once it's done, we hide it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21438-0

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21764-1
04:00:44.824 --> 04:00:49.934

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/21766-0
04:00:56.477 --> 04:00:56.677

that. Elton John. He's like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22655-1
04:14:14.565 --> 04:14:21.437
<v Ricky Horton>I just saw these people come through.
We got a lot of stories being interesting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22656-0
04:14:23.237 --> 04:14:23.357
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22692-0
04:14:30.197 --> 04:14:35.318
<v Ricky Horton>I asked them.
I asked all of them how political they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22692-1
04:14:35.318 --> 04:14:42.178
<v Ricky Horton>want to, you know, because, yeah,
different administration's from you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22692-2
04:14:42.178 --> 04:14:45.077
<v Ricky Horton>And she said they're actually.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22716-0
04:14:45.237 --> 04:14:51.835
<v Ricky Horton>They try to not watch a lot of stuff.
They don't want to be too biased with the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22716-1
04:14:51.835 --> 04:14:55.546
<v Ricky Horton>other coats.
They don't know the other side,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22716-2
04:14:55.546 --> 04:15:02.557
<v Ricky Horton>but you said the flip side of that too is
they're kind of seeing the news, you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22733-0
04:15:03.237 --> 04:15:08.593
<v Ricky Horton>But she said everybody, you know,
the news takes it so different. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22733-1
04:15:08.593 --> 04:15:12.611
<v Ricky Horton>she's like,
they're just normal people and it doesn't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22733-2
04:15:12.611 --> 04:15:14.397
<v Ricky Horton>matter who gets through.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22736-0
04:15:22.237 --> 04:15:24.997
<v Ricky Horton>He's like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22766-0
04:15:30.997 --> 04:15:39.680
<v Ricky Horton>Is she does work the White House or does
she have to go on these advanced teams?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22766-1
04:15:39.680 --> 04:15:47.077
<v Ricky Horton>So the White House is her main focus,
but when he travels then they.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22795-0
04:15:47.317 --> 04:15:51.679
<v Ricky Horton>They ask for volunteers that want to go
on a trip with them,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22795-1
04:15:51.679 --> 04:15:57.042
<v Ricky Horton>and if they don't get volunteers,
then they get volunteers. So yeah, sure,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22795-2
04:15:57.042 --> 04:16:00.832
<v Ricky Horton>very different places, you know,
every now and then,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22795-3
04:16:00.832 --> 04:16:02.477
<v Ricky Horton>but they do have to go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22799-0
04:16:02.597 --> 04:16:05.957
<v Ricky Horton>I start running trips every every year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22819-0
04:16:14.037 --> 04:16:18.949
<v Ricky Horton>They don't fly on the luxury
accommodations.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22819-1
04:16:18.949 --> 04:16:25.607
<v Ricky Horton>They usually fly in the car.
They're not flying the airport.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22819-2
04:16:25.607 --> 04:16:26.917
<v Ricky Horton>They're not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22826-0
04:16:30.797 --> 04:16:35.037
<v Ricky Horton>How much gear you gonna check with you?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22834-0
04:16:38.677 --> 04:16:44.717
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see. I can let me see helicopter.
Yeah, it's unbelievable.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22836-0
04:16:45.677 --> 04:16:49.517
<v Ricky Horton>So did you tell where? I'm sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22861-0
04:16:53.037 --> 04:16:59.229
<v Ricky Horton>He was just that.
Trump was just at the Kennedy Center,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22861-1
04:16:59.229 --> 04:17:05.752
<v Ricky Horton>which is in DC,
but they had to take a whole detail there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22861-2
04:17:05.752 --> 04:17:06.637
<v Ricky Horton>She was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22884-0
04:17:07.797 --> 04:17:12.949
<v Ricky Horton>Working that,
but may that be cool because that was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22884-1
04:17:12.949 --> 04:17:18.300
<v Ricky Horton>kiss was there. George Strait,
I forget who all else.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22884-2
04:17:18.300 --> 04:17:22.957
<v Ricky Horton>I'd like to see things.
She's like outside of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22886-0
04:17:23.477 --> 04:17:26.557
<v Ricky Horton>I was sexy just being in the White House.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22890-0
04:17:41.997 --> 04:17:44.277
<v Ricky Horton>I'd rather do steal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22891-0
04:17:50.917 --> 04:17:51.797
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22893-0
04:18:05.157 --> 04:18:05.277
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22897-0
04:18:10.117 --> 04:18:11.877
<v Ricky Horton>I heard a lot that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22934-0
04:18:13.557 --> 04:18:20.295
<v Ricky Horton>Like a lot of shops barely touch the
capabilities what power I have to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22934-1
04:18:20.295 --> 04:18:25.416
<v Ricky Horton>Probably I should I should keep better
statistics on it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22934-2
04:18:25.416 --> 04:18:30.717
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm guessing 60 to 70% of the clients
have had it for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22949-0
04:18:34.157 --> 04:18:47.237
<v Ricky Horton>For 15 years.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22976-0
04:18:47.637 --> 04:18:55.741
<v Ricky Horton>It didn't use it to that labels. I mean,
I believe you and I know we're taking the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22976-1
04:18:55.741 --> 04:19:03.357
<v Ricky Horton>knowledge and stuff. Yeah, the guy,
the guy I had dinner with last night went</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/22976-2
04:19:03.357 --> 04:19:06.677
<v Ricky Horton>in control of that suite to power.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23037-0
04:19:17.197 --> 04:19:22.320
<v Ricky Horton>I will be dabbled in.
He said most of the time the estimators</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23037-1
04:19:22.320 --> 04:19:27.856
<v Ricky Horton>and the detailers are the same people.
If you really don't set up,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23037-2
04:19:27.856 --> 04:19:34.218
<v Ricky Horton>really just don't need it. So yeah,
estimators and detailers for you to sign</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23037-3
04:19:34.218 --> 04:19:34.797
<v Ricky Horton>that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23056-0
04:19:35.077 --> 04:19:42.404
<v Ricky Horton>That's not what I've I've seen,
but I haven't seen that way. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23056-1
04:19:42.404 --> 04:19:50.170
<v Ricky Horton>it's like, I can have that too.
So this is about 100 and there'll be a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23056-2
04:19:50.170 --> 04:19:50.717
<v Ricky Horton>shot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23089-0
04:19:50.997 --> 04:19:56.193
<v Ricky Horton>That I'm getting it.
So I feel that very much somebody's I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23089-1
04:19:56.193 --> 04:20:02.798
<v Ricky Horton>know whether they want to use the
software if it's for project managers is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23089-2
04:20:02.798 --> 04:20:09.756
<v Ricky Horton>like pulling feed and getting in there,
which I don't understand because their</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23089-3
04:20:09.756 --> 04:20:10.637
<v Ricky Horton>whole job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23112-0
04:20:10.957 --> 04:20:14.612
<v Ricky Horton>Project that's what's happening on the
projects.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23112-1
04:20:14.612 --> 04:20:20.282
<v Ricky Horton>I've spent about actually half my career
estimated in the other half of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23112-2
04:20:20.282 --> 04:20:24.684
<v Ricky Horton>project manager.
So I haven't had the opportunity with you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23112-3
04:20:24.684 --> 04:20:26.997
<v Ricky Horton>very much, but I would like to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23135-0
04:20:27.037 --> 04:20:33.849
<v Ricky Horton>It is. It is weird to have an idea,
but you know, and that's a that's an ad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23135-1
04:20:33.849 --> 04:20:40.838
<v Ricky Horton>We shouldn't get some project vendors are
all in the right and others are just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23135-2
04:20:40.838 --> 04:20:42.077
<v Ricky Horton>don't want to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23136-0
04:20:42.477 --> 04:20:43.077
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23138-0
04:20:47.157 --> 04:20:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>The time structure came down and said to
rise at the cutting edge.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23139-0
04:20:53.837 --> 04:20:54.157
<v Ricky Horton>Please.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23156-0
04:20:56.717 --> 04:21:02.765
<v Ricky Horton>But because it was just laughable and how
slow we were,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23156-1
04:21:02.765 --> 04:21:07.517
<v Ricky Horton>but both of you have been one ran a
Python.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23173-0
04:21:10.037 --> 04:21:19.659
<v Ricky Horton>And Horizon ran. I have a beam up there.
Beam one start next year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23173-1
04:21:19.659 --> 04:21:25.117
<v Ricky Horton>Are you guys driving to see something?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23174-0
04:21:25.557 --> 04:21:26.157
<v Ricky Horton>Show.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23217-0
04:21:27.717 --> 04:21:31.229
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
it's I think the cheapest way to increase</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23217-1
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:36.708
<v Ricky Horton>capacity. I'm supposed to think the,
you know, base models are about 300,000.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23217-2
04:21:36.708 --> 04:21:42.468
<v Ricky Horton>I think those we don't need abortments.
It's like a coasting song in front of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23217-3
04:21:42.468 --> 04:21:44.997
<v Ricky Horton>They're very, very nice setups, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23253-0
04:21:45.197 --> 04:21:53.001
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you. Probably just for our code,
but it's probably about 1,000,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23253-1
04:21:53.001 --> 04:21:59.133
<v Ricky Horton>000 bucks for it. Yeah,
you got the advantage, though.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23253-2
04:21:59.133 --> 04:22:04.597
<v Ricky Horton>It's actually going to the drill saw next
to it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23261-0
04:22:04.597 --> 04:22:10.157
<v Ricky Horton>Plug and play, but yeah,
it's it's more like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23288-0
04:22:12.517 --> 04:22:21.271
<v Ricky Horton>You know what I'm surprised you went out
is nobody's off at that job. And it's out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23288-1
04:22:21.271 --> 04:22:29.192
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, they've got it. I mean years ago,
man, it's a freaking doc program.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23288-2
04:22:29.192 --> 04:22:31.277
<v Ricky Horton>Why didn't somebody?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23322-0
04:22:32.517 --> 04:22:42.542
<v Ricky Horton>Update this thing to know I I had heard
that SDS was looking at buying it because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23322-1
04:22:42.542 --> 04:22:51.957
<v Ricky Horton>you know that that structure was that lot
that suite and it really elevated.</v>

04:22:52.037 --> 04:22:55.856

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23341-2
04:23:00.813 --> 04:23:04.957
<v Ricky Horton>SDS is awesome.
I'm I'm a first year old business.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23342-0

04:23:09.557 --> 04:23:13.563
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
one of the things these guys have been</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23360-1
04:23:13.563 --> 04:23:17.837
<v Ricky Horton>chasing was all the pesto work for Intel,
yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23384-0
04:23:19.157 --> 04:23:24.258
<v Ricky Horton>Problem is,
it's it's a material handling job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23384-1
04:23:24.258 --> 04:23:29.467
<v Ricky Horton>It's not a bad job. Yeah, it's a maximum.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23384-2
04:23:29.467 --> 04:23:33.917
<v Ricky Horton>but they have like 100 different designs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23428-0
04:23:35.317 --> 04:23:42.216
<v Ricky Horton>So they throw about at you and every week
the schedule move cuz medical will come</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23428-1
04:23:42.216 --> 04:23:46.759
<v Ricky Horton>in a couple of weeks,
go out a couple of weeks. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23428-2
04:23:46.759 --> 04:23:52.986
<v Ricky Horton>and if you don't have all the designs
built, built in your system set up,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23428-3
04:23:52.986 --> 04:23:54.837
<v Ricky Horton>releasing it was hard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23461-0
04:23:54.917 --> 04:24:00.343
<v Ricky Horton>Set up, they get you 22 days,
22 working days to build one and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23461-1
04:24:00.343 --> 04:24:04.333
<v Ricky Horton>they pay a premium for 10 day build or
five days.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23461-2
04:24:04.333 --> 04:24:09.121
<v Ricky Horton>And it's just a game of managing the
logistics of it. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23461-3
04:24:09.121 --> 04:24:10.877
<v Ricky Horton>you just have to have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23471-0
04:24:11.397 --> 04:24:14.886
<v Ricky Horton>10 truckloads of four post border sitting
out there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23471-1
04:24:14.886 --> 04:24:18.837
<v Ricky Horton>It's got to happen and then you need all
three eights play.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23514-0
04:24:21.477 --> 04:24:25.313
<v Ricky Horton>It's. I've done it three times.
I've never made money.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23514-1
04:24:25.313 --> 04:24:29.358
<v Ricky Horton>By the time you get set up about a year
and a half later,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23514-2
04:24:29.358 --> 04:24:34.659
<v Ricky Horton>they just ramp it down and some new
management team says let's do it again.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23514-3
04:24:34.659 --> 04:24:35.357
<v Ricky Horton>It's like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23546-0
04:24:37.317 --> 04:24:44.959
<v Ricky Horton>Never going to work because you don't
ramp up fast enough to make to get in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23546-1
04:24:44.959 --> 04:24:52.793
<v Ricky Horton>sweet spot to where you're comfortable.
Well, a lot of it's almost manufacturing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23546-2
04:24:52.793 --> 04:24:56.997
<v Ricky Horton>It is manufacturing. Yeah,
it's absolutely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23592-0
04:24:57.077 --> 04:25:02.381
<v Ricky Horton>Doing it,
I've only seen one fabricator that got a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23592-1
04:25:02.381 --> 04:25:10.805
<v Ricky Horton>job with a lot of repeatability on it and
just they just needs to be efficiency.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23592-2
04:25:10.805 --> 04:25:16.837
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they get everything.
They're like we are not there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23619-0
04:25:16.917 --> 04:25:21.242
<v Ricky Horton>And then figure out how to go.
We're telling them how to go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23619-1
04:25:21.242 --> 04:25:26.701
<v Ricky Horton>We're setting up all the gigs we're
setting up and they killed it. But most,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23619-2
04:25:26.701 --> 04:25:31.877
<v Ricky Horton>most publicators don't seem to get to
that level, but do you work for J.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23654-0
04:25:32.037 --> 04:25:40.244
<v Ricky Horton>So I think they have a structural shop in
Kansas City,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23654-1
04:25:40.244 --> 04:25:51.437
<v Ricky Horton>but they're doing some festivals or we
had a shop in the back of CO where.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23668-0
04:25:51.557 --> 04:26:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>You're paying dollars $2.00 per month.
Holy cow. So we were doing the bottom.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23680-0
04:26:09.317 --> 04:26:15.196
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, it felt completely came apart.
This was a test. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23680-1
04:26:15.196 --> 04:26:20.127
<v Ricky Horton>they were just bailing left and right.
We got that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23680-2
04:26:20.127 --> 04:26:25.437
<v Ricky Horton>They shut that contract down and all of a
sudden, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23719-0
04:26:41.077 --> 04:26:46.932
<v Ricky Horton>Multiple people not complying to things
in the PDX area.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23719-1
04:26:46.932 --> 04:26:54.328
<v Ricky Horton>There's no pedestals for you.
I don't know if it's but either pedestals</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23719-2
04:26:54.328 --> 04:26:54.637
<v Ricky Horton>or.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23750-0
04:26:58.037 --> 04:27:02.785
<v Ricky Horton>Doing like the data center platforms and
whatnot. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23750-1
04:27:02.785 --> 04:27:08.211
<v Ricky Horton>I that I can imagine that it's the
pencils are pretty specific.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23750-2
04:27:08.211 --> 04:27:14.654
<v Ricky Horton>They have a lot of features. Yeah,
a lot of drilling at the end of the day,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23750-3
04:27:14.654 --> 04:27:15.757
<v Ricky Horton>it's a stump.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23779-0
04:27:15.877 --> 04:27:22.384
<v Ricky Horton>If you ever been a chip fab,
all the utilities are on this floor and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23779-1
04:27:22.384 --> 04:27:29.458
<v Ricky Horton>all the tools are on this floor.
So they set these tools on these two foot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23779-2
04:27:29.458 --> 04:27:33.797
<v Ricky Horton>tall tables with all the utilities.
So these.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23795-0
04:27:34.197 --> 04:27:49.997
<v Ricky Horton>Tables are pretty complicated cut outs.
I know I know one I here in Arizona.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23805-0
04:27:50.437 --> 04:27:58.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I know. And there's one of them.
It's not like they're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23831-0
04:28:00.317 --> 04:28:06.268
<v Ricky Horton>Be a huge deal of things.
They're shipping them all loaded boys.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23831-1
04:28:06.268 --> 04:28:10.479
<v Ricky Horton>I appreciate it. Anything.
Every single time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23831-2
04:28:10.479 --> 04:28:16.797
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody gives me something.
You're a good guy. Not by choice. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23847-0
04:28:18.197 --> 04:28:25.195
<v Ricky Horton>If I if I have the freedom to choose
whether I can get glue or not,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23847-1
04:28:25.195 --> 04:28:28.797
<v Ricky Horton>that is definitely not for that is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23884-0
04:28:29.877 --> 04:28:35.197
<v Ricky Horton>15 when I was diagnosed slow.
So after that, free little became, uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23884-1
04:28:35.197 --> 04:28:41.597
<v Ricky Horton>that's a busy dude for you when you have
glutamine. I have an autoimmune response.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23884-2
04:28:41.597 --> 04:28:46.455
<v Ricky Horton>I like blood cells attack my stomach
lying when it intestines.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23884-3
04:28:46.455 --> 04:28:49.077
<v Ricky Horton>I figure it was stiff. That sucks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23914-0
04:28:50.917 --> 04:28:54.984
<v Ricky Horton>What's that?
A lot of people say it's from the GMO.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23914-1
04:28:54.984 --> 04:28:58.738
<v Ricky Horton>It's all the genetically modified foods
we got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23914-2
04:28:58.738 --> 04:29:04.839
<v Ricky Horton>Our body just can't recognize the the
greens and and all the different things</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23914-3
04:29:04.839 --> 04:29:06.717
<v Ricky Horton>they do to them anymore.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23917-0
04:29:07.717 --> 04:29:10.837
<v Ricky Horton>It confuses your immune system.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23929-0
04:29:12.317 --> 04:29:16.711
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that would kind of explain why you see</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23929-1
04:29:16.711 --> 04:29:22.277
<v Ricky Horton>more today. Yeah,

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23930-0
04:29:23.477 --> 04:29:25.277

<v Ricky Horton>Show.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23940-0
04:29:42.917 --> 04:29:48.157
<v Ricky Horton>And there's been bringing the gifts. No,
we will speak.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23941-0
04:29:49.997 --> 04:29:51.237
<v Ricky Horton>Problem.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23955-0
04:29:52.917 --> 04:29:58.820
<v Ricky Horton>I had. We were,
we were a little bit changing banks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23955-1
04:29:58.820 --> 04:30:05.837
<v Ricky Horton>So I know one guy came in and he's like,
here's your presence.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23975-0
04:30:08.117 --> 04:30:18.292
<v Ricky Horton>Please consider. Yeah, that's bonkers.
Holy moly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23975-1
04:30:18.292 --> 04:30:26.637
<v Ricky Horton>That's dedication and it's finance. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23986-0
04:30:26.917 --> 04:30:30.295
<v Ricky Horton>And I left two of them. Wow. Holy crap.
Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/23986-1
04:30:30.295 --> 04:30:35.877
<v Ricky Horton>I guess they're certain of what they're
supplying. They're they don't have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24031-0
04:30:41.397 --> 04:30:46.454
<v Ricky Horton>I'm really enjoying that my daughter is,

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24031-1
04:30:46.454 --> 04:30:52.065
<v Ricky Horton>she's still at home right now,
but she's old enough to where she likes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24031-2
04:30:52.065 --> 04:30:56.017
<v Ricky Horton>buying gifts.
And so I don't buy a single gift at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24031-3

<v Ricky Horton>Christmas anymore. She's like,
who do you want to get bought?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24042-0
04:31:00.997 --> 04:31:05.605
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I don't know.
We bought some unusual cords.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24042-1
04:31:05.605 --> 04:31:11.597
<v Ricky Horton>Makes me look good. There you go. Good.
That's what you're done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24062-0
04:31:15.157 --> 04:31:20.728
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm not. I'm not.
I spent over $1000 to get home from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24062-1
04:31:20.728 --> 04:31:22.957
<v Ricky Horton>holidays, so I was like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24091-0
04:31:26.637 --> 04:31:33.489
<v Ricky Horton>Your gift is my presence. Yeah,
so I'll be home for 9 days, Minnesota.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24091-1
04:31:33.489 --> 04:31:41.210
<v Ricky Horton>So you buy yourself a Frontier Airplane's
car, the most uncomfortable airplane,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24091-2
04:31:41.210 --> 04:31:43.237
<v Ricky Horton>like if you buy that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24134-0
04:31:43.917 --> 04:31:48.465
<v Ricky Horton>Annual pass. How do you do?
All you pay is the taxes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24134-1
04:31:48.465 --> 04:31:55.035
<v Ricky Horton>So I've been applying back and forth
between here in Vegas for the last seven</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24134-2
04:31:55.035 --> 04:32:00.679
<v Ricky Horton>months, $15.31 a flight.
They just had a sale and it cost $299 for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24134-3
04:32:00.679 --> 04:32:01.437
<v Ricky Horton>the year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24167-0
04:32:03.157 --> 04:32:06.503
<v Ricky Horton>Package, right.
So it's $299 a year and I think $15.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24167-1
04:32:06.503 --> 04:32:11.111
<v Ricky Horton>31 a flight. Utah was the same. Oh,
you find it here because I was like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24167-2
04:32:11.111 --> 04:32:16.225
<v Ricky Horton>I thought we should do that for Tucson,
but it doesn't help her. Yeah, yeah, no,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24167-3
04:32:16.225 --> 04:32:18.877
<v Ricky Horton>you find a gateway, right? No, definitely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24186-0
04:32:19.157 --> 04:32:26.452
<v Ricky Horton>Frontiers have been in Vegas or Utah with
something about 15-16 bucks each stage</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24186-1
04:32:26.452 --> 04:32:34.197
<v Ricky Horton>flight. I don't think they'll do too soon.
I have Vietnam. That's nice frontier goal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-0
04:32:34.877 --> 04:32:39.232
<v Ricky Horton>It's like sitting on a bucket, man.
It's they're not so much of hard rocks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-1
04:32:39.232 --> 04:32:42.212
<v Ricky Horton>When they cancel their flights,
they're done. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-2
04:32:42.212 --> 04:32:46.740
<v Ricky Horton>the whole thing to that is you got to
take the morning or mid-morning flights.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-3
04:32:46.740 --> 04:32:50.064
<v Ricky Horton>All the evening flights,
they're always either delayed or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-4
04:32:50.064 --> 04:32:53.101
<v Ricky Horton>cancelled.
I never had to wait twice in seven months</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24234-5
04:32:53.101 --> 04:32:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>and delayed me probably.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24249-0
04:32:54.677 --> 04:33:03.062
<v Ricky Horton>15.9 I was stranded in Seattle.
I got to the airport and I'm in security</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24249-1
04:33:03.062 --> 04:33:03.637
<v Ricky Horton>like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24279-0
04:33:05.157 --> 04:33:09.491
<v Ricky Horton>Your plan is new. What are you doing?
It's curious. Well, what the? No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24279-1
04:33:09.491 --> 04:33:13.585
<v Ricky Horton>you didn't get the e-mail. Yeah,
there's my e-mail. Cool. My rider.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24279-2
04:33:13.585 --> 04:33:16.414
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll figure out what I'm going to do.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24279-3
04:33:16.414 --> 04:33:21.049
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to talk about I've got a while
from here. They get canceled. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24279-4
04:33:21.049 --> 04:33:23.277
<v Ricky Horton>that is pretty. That's weather cheap.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24305-0
04:33:23.557 --> 04:33:30.002
<v Ricky Horton>I flew to San Diego.
And then when I finally got on the plane,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24305-1
04:33:30.002 --> 04:33:37.572
<v Ricky Horton>we get down and they reverse the jets and
everything and the whole place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24305-2
04:33:37.572 --> 04:33:40.437
<v Ricky Horton>I might survive this longer.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24310-0
04:33:40.517 --> 04:33:44.637
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I I have an orange County,
California too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24353-0
04:33:46.197 --> 04:33:50.842
<v Ricky Horton>More bumps and rabbits on those ones.
They've seen a few, a few fights.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24353-1
04:33:50.842 --> 04:33:55.682
<v Ricky Horton>I fly there and they were done.
Just got a struggle in the American dumps.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24353-2
04:33:55.682 --> 04:33:58.585
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have the everywhere,
so that's good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24353-3
04:33:58.585 --> 04:34:01.876
<v Ricky Horton>I fly some country all the time.
Southern country.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24353-4
04:34:01.876 --> 04:34:05.877
<v Ricky Horton>I react and they're they're have done in
Minnesota. So I get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24385-0
04:34:05.957 --> 04:34:09.925
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
my flight was the expense department from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24385-1
04:34:09.925 --> 04:34:15.050
<v Ricky Horton>holidays and it's getting my two dogs
watched here back home.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24385-2
04:34:15.050 --> 04:34:21.415
<v Ricky Horton>I used to be oil in the Southwest,
but I got a daughter-in-law of a bunch of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24385-3
04:34:21.415 --> 04:34:25.301
<v Ricky Horton>dogs.
They've changed less than seven or eight</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24385-4
04:34:25.301 --> 04:34:25.797
<v Ricky Horton>times.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24415-0
04:34:25.877 --> 04:34:30.636
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's what I hear. Yeah,
the prices have become the same as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24415-1
04:34:30.636 --> 04:34:34.755
<v Ricky Horton>American. Yeah,
I just like if I go to the American city,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24415-2
04:34:34.755 --> 04:34:38.733

<v Ricky Horton>I go to Houston to fly United or.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24450-0
04:34:41.157 --> 04:34:46.854
<v Ricky Horton>Bill is really nice, really nice everyone.
I have funded it while I just,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24450-1
04:34:46.854 --> 04:34:51.166
<v Ricky Horton>I I can't give up my status of American
that I got now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24450-2
04:34:51.166 --> 04:34:56.325
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's always going to be, yeah,
I need to place out with that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24450-3
04:34:56.325 --> 04:34:57.557
<v Ricky Horton>so I have clear.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24485-0
04:34:58.077 --> 04:35:02.929
<v Ricky Horton>Elite member or whatever it is.
I actually got the points I have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24485-1
04:35:02.929 --> 04:35:08.222
<v Ricky Horton>So this year I have three companions that.
So anywhere I put my flight,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24485-2
04:35:08.222 --> 04:35:12.412
<v Ricky Horton>but I did all that before I started the
frontier things.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24485-3
04:35:12.412 --> 04:35:14.397
<v Ricky Horton>That'll be up to this year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24527-0
04:35:14.757 --> 04:35:19.458
<v Ricky Horton>I get bumped up first class a lot.
And so I'll be like, wait,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24527-1
04:35:19.458 --> 04:35:23.476
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be up there. Well,
they'll come get you, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24527-2
04:35:23.476 --> 04:35:29.466
<v Ricky Horton>Because they'll, if they got a seat,
they'll find out who's the highest ranked</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24527-3
04:35:29.466 --> 04:35:29.997
<v Ricky Horton>person.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24560-0
04:35:34.437 --> 04:35:39.250
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, steroids will fill you up.
If I'm not, if I don't get in first class,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24560-1
04:35:39.250 --> 04:35:44.000
<v Ricky Horton>if I don't get bumped up, then I'll,
I'll walk by first class and I'll see</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24560-2
04:35:44.000 --> 04:35:47.863
<v Ricky Horton>somebody up there.
If I see a kid or something sitting there</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24560-3
04:35:47.863 --> 04:35:50.397
<v Ricky Horton>smishing something, I'll earn that seat.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24602-0
04:35:50.557 --> 04:35:55.407
<v Ricky Horton>It makes a lot of difference in the world.
Oh, it makes a huge difference,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24602-1
04:35:55.407 --> 04:35:59.351
<v Ricky Horton>especially when you're flying from one
side of the US. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24602-2
04:35:59.351 --> 04:36:02.908
<v Ricky Horton>you're out there for hours now. Yeah,
flying out here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24602-3
04:36:02.908 --> 04:36:07.693
<v Ricky Horton>a little over 4 hour flight from
Charlotte and I got first bus on the way</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24602-4
04:36:07.693 --> 04:36:09.957
<v Ricky Horton>out here. Yeah, that one would fly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24613-0
04:36:10.357 --> 04:36:16.309
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't make any.
Most of my advice would be hours. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24613-1
04:36:16.309 --> 04:36:20.917
<v Ricky Horton>I'm in here. Yeah,
that's that's probably good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24616-0
04:36:22.277 --> 04:36:23.597
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, this one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24649-0
04:36:25.877 --> 04:36:30.082
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I've got a lot too, do you?
But when I travel to the Pacific</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24649-1
04:36:30.082 --> 04:36:33.221
<v Ricky Horton>Northwest,
I've probably lived in Seattle for the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24649-2
04:36:33.221 --> 04:36:36.736
<v Ricky Horton>longest time. You know,
I'm a long distance girlfriend.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24649-3
04:36:36.736 --> 04:36:40.754
<v Ricky Horton>So there's no. Why not?
They're all paying time. Long distance,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24649-4
04:36:40.754 --> 04:36:42.637
<v Ricky Horton>girlfriend. That's hard to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24670-0
04:36:47.437 --> 04:36:52.710
<v Ricky Horton>I just created a long distance.
I live here 3 days a week,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24670-1
04:36:52.710 --> 04:36:57.448
<v Ricky Horton>four days a week. Yeah, yeah,
it's it's interesting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24670-2
04:36:57.448 --> 04:37:01.917
<v Ricky Horton>We see each other most month now though,
so yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24671-0
04:37:02.197 --> 04:37:02.277
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24697-0
04:37:03.317 --> 04:37:07.996
<v Ricky Horton>I had a funeral with my Brown on Monday
and people out here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24697-1
04:37:07.996 --> 04:37:13.059
<v Ricky Horton>we flew back to Minnesota together,
went to the funeral together.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24697-2
04:37:13.059 --> 04:37:18.199
<v Ricky Horton>He got a flight back to Seattle.
I kind of flight back here. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24697-3
04:37:18.199 --> 04:37:20.117
<v Ricky Horton>see him for a day or two.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24701-0
04:37:20.197 --> 04:37:23.658
<v Ricky Horton>That's nice.
Who's file is correct in any office from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24701-1
04:37:23.658 --> 04:37:25.197
<v Ricky Horton>here? Some country does.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24702-0
04:37:26.677 --> 04:37:26.877
<v Ricky Horton>The.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24706-0
04:37:28.277 --> 04:37:30.317
<v Ricky Horton>About 3 hours appointments.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24711-0
04:37:32.237 --> 04:37:35.157
<v Ricky Horton>I used to go to Wisconsin.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24745-0
04:37:36.557 --> 04:37:40.887
<v Ricky Horton>Couple times I went through Chicago and
American never made it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24745-1
04:37:40.887 --> 04:37:45.218
<v Ricky Horton>Always got bogged down to Chicago.
I finally said I drove here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24745-2
04:37:45.218 --> 04:37:50.090
<v Ricky Horton>flew up on Allegiant direct flight to the
Janesville. I was like, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24745-3
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:52.797
<v Ricky Horton>that's what I'm going to do from now on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24785-0
04:37:53.077 --> 04:37:57.432
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, because you can't.
That Chicago airport is horrible. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24785-1
04:37:57.432 --> 04:38:02.591
<v Ricky Horton>I've refused to connect through it.
The one that I'm having much trouble out</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24785-2
04:38:02.591 --> 04:38:06.209
<v Ricky Horton>on the status,
I've gotten started in more times than</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24785-3
04:38:06.209 --> 04:38:11.637
<v Ricky Horton>not in Dallas. It's. I hate that airport,
but it's the biggest American hub, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24793-0
04:38:11.717 --> 04:38:17.797
<v Ricky Horton>If there's a lady on the West Coast,
I'm going to be in Dallas.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24835-0
04:38:19.477 --> 04:38:24.148
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
my dad wouldn't be interested about here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24835-1
04:38:24.148 --> 04:38:29.615
<v Ricky Horton>is in Florida.
He almost never can find a connector in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24835-2
04:38:29.615 --> 04:38:34.982
<v Ricky Horton>the red flag.
Florida and here it's always, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24835-3
04:38:34.982 --> 04:38:35.877
<v Ricky Horton>that's a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24840-0
04:38:35.957 --> 04:38:40.237
<v Ricky Horton>And Delta actually flies direct at land
too, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24876-0
04:38:42.837 --> 04:38:48.752
<v Ricky Horton>That wasn't too bad. I love Seatac.
Seatac has so much stuff in it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24876-1
04:38:48.752 --> 04:38:53.189
<v Ricky Horton>That's and they're completely doing a
bunch of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24876-2
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:58.757
<v Ricky Horton>So it's nice to live in there.
There's a couple areas that are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24913-0
04:38:58.917 --> 04:39:03.614
<v Ricky Horton>Flow off by San Francisco. Yeah,
what I think about Seatac is going to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24913-1
04:39:03.614 --> 04:39:07.649
<v Ricky Horton>security there to go to Canada.
Some of those lines, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24913-2
04:39:07.649 --> 04:39:12.677
<v Ricky Horton>the reason I got Century is to avoid that
**** if you don't have a Century.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24944-0
04:39:14.277 --> 04:39:21.945
<v Ricky Horton>Sea tax lines to go to fly to Canada are
just, I mean, just you could be there now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24944-1
04:39:21.945 --> 04:39:29.157
<v Ricky Horton>Last time I I may I get satisfied here
and maybe they had a a different thing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24944-2
04:39:29.157 --> 04:39:33.357
<v Ricky Horton>but they had seven different TSA
checkpoints.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24988-0
04:39:33.637 --> 04:39:38.240
<v Ricky Horton>For one area, right.
And that would get you to gates AB and C</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24988-1
04:39:38.240 --> 04:39:41.580
<v Ricky Horton>and but yeah,
I mean now you know it's this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24988-2
04:39:41.580 --> 04:39:46.480
<v Ricky Horton>it's this customs clearance, right?
Now if you have Global Entry,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/24988-3
04:39:46.480 --> 04:39:52.197
<v Ricky Horton>you don't even almost need to stop
walking. You can just walk right through.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25003-0
04:39:52.237 --> 04:39:56.426
<v Ricky Horton>Facial recognition gets you,
you just walk right through.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25003-1
04:39:56.426 --> 04:40:00.037
<v Ricky Horton>So that solves that problem if you don't
have it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25049-0
04:40:01.157 --> 04:40:05.452
<v Ricky Horton>Pre-check now is getting to be.
There's so many people.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25049-1
04:40:05.452 --> 04:40:09.671
<v Ricky Horton>It's crazy a few months ago.
I had the kids pre-check.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25049-2
04:40:09.671 --> 04:40:15.807
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to get clear because I sat on
for 45 minutes and days got ****** ***.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25049-3
04:40:15.807 --> 04:40:20.717
<v Ricky Horton>I got to get clear and I get clear and
it's pretty short still.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25068-0
04:40:20.717 --> 04:40:28.805
<v Ricky Horton>I hope that it's clear because Charlotte
doesn't act clear. If Charlotte gets it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25068-1
04:40:28.805 --> 04:40:30.877
<v Ricky Horton>then I'll do it. But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25072-0
04:40:32.037 --> 04:40:34.957
<v Ricky Horton>That whole thing is such a freaking
hustle.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25120-0
04:40:36.317 --> 04:40:39.533
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's still the the TSA pre-check goes</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25120-1
04:40:39.533 --> 04:40:44.578
<v Ricky Horton>goes pretty fast. You know,
it seems like you know like 10 people in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25120-2
04:40:44.578 --> 04:40:50.207
<v Ricky Horton>London going to that TSA pre-check,
but couple of times there is a long line</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25120-3
04:40:50.207 --> 04:40:54.301
<v Ricky Horton>and it came clear.
I hate when it's clear people get in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25120-4
04:40:54.301 --> 04:40:55.837
<v Ricky Horton>front of it. So yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25121-0
04:40:55.877 --> 04:40:57.237
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25133-0
04:40:58.717 --> 04:41:01.495
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we must have flied another light once</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25133-1
04:41:01.495 --> 04:41:05.157
<v Ricky Horton>'cause the lines are so long trying to
get through, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25170-0
04:41:07.037 --> 04:41:14.259
<v Ricky Horton>I'm on the way to the airport for 30
hours. As soon as I get a net channel,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25170-1
04:41:14.259 --> 04:41:18.440
<v Ricky Horton>I'll start traveling. Yeah,
don't be wrong.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25170-2
04:41:18.440 --> 04:41:23.477
<v Ricky Horton>Last week I flew out at Salt Lake to
their home and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25215-0
04:41:23.757 --> 04:41:29.148
<v Ricky Horton>I had a red eye, which I hate,
and I actually got done really early with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25215-1
04:41:29.148 --> 04:41:33.063
<v Ricky Horton>the client.
So I had about 11 hours before my flight</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25215-2
04:41:33.063 --> 04:41:39.193
<v Ricky Horton>and so there were a couple of flights I
might get on. So I went on to the airport.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25215-3
04:41:39.193 --> 04:41:42.517
<v Ricky Horton>I actually sat in that airport for 11
hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25249-0
04:41:42.637 --> 04:41:46.755
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, what are you?
You're leaving here at 3:46?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25249-1
04:41:46.755 --> 04:41:51.762
<v Ricky Horton>What time do you get back to the shop?
So yeah, about 35. No,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25249-2
04:41:51.762 --> 04:41:56.849
<v Ricky Horton>I'll put it back later cause it's 3:46.
Plus you've got to go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25249-3
04:41:56.849 --> 04:41:59.837
<v Ricky Horton>Plus you've had three hours, 7 hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25269-0
04:42:00.117 --> 04:42:07.469
<v Ricky Horton>So my flight leaves here 341.
I I land at 938. Of course, going back,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25269-1
04:42:07.469 --> 04:42:13.877
<v Ricky Horton>it's faster because you catch the catch
the wind, yeah, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25279-0
04:42:16.357 --> 04:42:21.157
<v Ricky Horton>41 at home, so yeah, it's about 404.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25288-0
04:42:23.077 --> 04:42:27.237
<v Ricky Horton>Do you live directly in Charlotte?
I live out there in Bath, Charlotte, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25317-0
04:42:29.357 --> 04:42:33.941
<v Ricky Horton>A good friend of mine,
he moved from Phoenix to Houston.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25317-1
04:42:33.941 --> 04:42:39.972
<v Ricky Horton>He works for Ferguson and then I just
moved back to Raleigh and his wife's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25317-2
04:42:39.972 --> 04:42:44.717
<v Ricky Horton>family is there and parents need care.
Yeah, that's about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25329-0
04:42:45.357 --> 04:42:53.107
<v Ricky Horton>Two hours instead of moving. Yeah,
I think we're pretty happy we live in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25329-1
04:42:53.107 --> 04:42:53.957
<v Ricky Horton>Houston.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25343-0
04:42:59.517 --> 04:43:05.208
<v Ricky Horton>So you're planning to move here or you
want to keep doing this or you can go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25343-1
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:06.317
<v Ricky Horton>back and forth.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25359-0
04:43:09.317 --> 04:43:14.296
<v Ricky Horton>All depends on if they want to build a
shop, if they want to do something,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25359-1
04:43:14.296 --> 04:43:18.877
<v Ricky Horton>where they want to do it.
Keep being told it's not going to be here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25372-0
04:43:20.077 --> 04:43:25.597
<v Ricky Horton>I get the sense of let's look at the
assets we have and try and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25379-0
04:43:27.037 --> 04:43:30.432
<v Ricky Horton>Make those more productive.
I get a sense there's some of that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25379-1
04:43:30.432 --> 04:43:30.917
<v Ricky Horton>happened.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25412-0
04:43:33.117 --> 04:43:38.889
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, there's so much binding work.
You know, semi bond is busy here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25412-1
04:43:38.889 --> 04:43:42.657
<v Ricky Horton>but there's data centers are doing this
thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25412-2
04:43:42.657 --> 04:43:49.392
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't work in Arizona's in the mining
state. So much work in mining coming here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25412-3
04:43:49.392 --> 04:43:51.797
<v Ricky Horton>We're not really set up to do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25414-0
04:43:52.677 --> 04:43:55.557
<v Ricky Horton>Finding scale.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25415-0
04:43:57.717 --> 04:43:58.157
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25440-0
04:44:01.277 --> 04:44:08.479
<v Ricky Horton>What's their next closest shop?
Other than the manate shop? Do you hear?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25440-1
04:44:08.479 --> 04:44:15.781
<v Ricky Horton>Like what state? Bloomfield. Yeah,
Bloomfield, NM, just on Durango. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25440-2
04:44:15.781 --> 04:44:17.557
<v Ricky Horton>just on the coast.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25461-0
04:44:17.917 --> 04:44:22.399
<v Ricky Horton>What is it at the drive up there?
It's pretty small.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25461-1
04:44:22.399 --> 04:44:27.896
<v Ricky Horton>I think most of their stuff's like back
and stuff. That's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25461-2
04:44:27.896 --> 04:44:32.717
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have a lot of equipment.
It's smaller than here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25486-0
04:44:33.117 --> 04:44:37.913
<v Ricky Horton>What's the next one after that? Casper.
As I said, Casper,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25486-1
04:44:37.913 --> 04:44:43.522
<v Ricky Horton>they have something in Texas too.
I haven't heard about that at all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25486-2
04:44:43.522 --> 04:44:48.237
<v Ricky Horton>I see it on the map.
What do they do in Casper, you know?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25487-0
04:44:48.997 --> 04:44:49.237
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25522-0
04:44:50.557 --> 04:44:55.372
<v Ricky Horton>I think there are all pipe fitters out
there too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25522-1
04:44:55.372 --> 04:45:00.283
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of them are existing stuff.
So pipe fitters,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25522-2
04:45:00.283 --> 04:45:08.277
<v Ricky Horton>their Montana shop is supposedly set up
pretty well to get a new light structural.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25534-0
04:45:08.477 --> 04:45:12.306
<v Ricky Horton>I hear there's not. I mean,
the report that Chris said,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25534-1
04:45:12.306 --> 04:45:16.477
<v Ricky Horton>there's hardly any you're putting it out
either. Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25539-0
04:45:17.197 --> 04:45:20.917
<v Ricky Horton>Where we do a bit closer because that
barely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25570-0
04:45:22.077 --> 04:45:27.898
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I think there's there's thoughts.
There's there's a structural shock. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25570-1
04:45:27.898 --> 04:45:31.163
<v Ricky Horton>really.
I didn't notice that when I walked in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25570-2
04:45:31.163 --> 04:45:37.197
<v Ricky Horton>yesterday, but I think that's the thought.
Could be, could be, but it's it's pretty.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25600-0
04:45:37.997 --> 04:45:41.343
<v Ricky Horton>They got,
they got a plastic cutter out there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25600-1
04:45:41.343 --> 04:45:45.545
<v Ricky Horton>They got a roller.
They just got to come out there and eat</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25600-2
04:45:45.545 --> 04:45:49.675
<v Ricky Horton>it with a stick.
They got a little tiny press break and a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25600-3
04:45:49.675 --> 04:45:50.957
<v Ricky Horton>little tiny shear.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25647-0
04:45:52.557 --> 04:45:59.426
<v Ricky Horton>That's the extended instruction. Oh,
and I have the one that just counts.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25647-1
04:45:59.426 --> 04:46:04.439
<v Ricky Horton>That's the extended instructions that
they have here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25647-2
04:46:04.439 --> 04:46:10.009
<v Ricky Horton>So you forgot to mention that every time
we use our breaks,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25647-3
04:46:10.009 --> 04:46:12.237
<v Ricky Horton>we use our shear breaks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25655-0
04:46:12.317 --> 04:46:15.924
<v Ricky Horton>No,
I can't even run it at it's actual</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25655-1
04:46:15.924 --> 04:46:20.457
<v Ricky Horton>capacity.
The capacity they want it's derated so</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25655-2
04:46:20.457 --> 04:46:21.197
<v Ricky Horton>much so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25674-0
04:46:23.557 --> 04:46:32.259
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm having a break. What's that?
Iron worker? No, I didn't see it. Oh, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25674-1
04:46:32.259 --> 04:46:37.326
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's jump up their angles and fly bars.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25674-2
04:46:37.326 --> 04:46:37.877
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25684-0
04:46:39.517 --> 04:46:44.402
<v Ricky Horton>But mostly the flat light,
but the ain't going in the CPC.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25684-1
04:46:44.402 --> 04:46:47.797
<v Ricky Horton>There's one that's working with it, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25690-0
04:46:49.317 --> 04:46:52.077
<v Ricky Horton>That's like a low hate relationship with
that thing is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25697-0
04:46:54.317 --> 04:46:58.317
<v Ricky Horton>I will go out and then the whole machine
will lose calibration.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25705-0
04:46:59.277 --> 04:47:03.917
<v Ricky Horton>And then be like, well,
why don't you turn the machine off? What?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25727-0
04:47:04.557 --> 04:47:08.355
<v Ricky Horton>You know what your machine up at the end
of the day? Well, for batteries,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25727-1
04:47:08.355 --> 04:47:12.462
<v Ricky Horton>you shouldn't set your machine up. Well,
we didn't know that the battery wasn't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25727-2
04:47:12.462 --> 04:47:14.977
<v Ricky Horton>working.
We've had this machine for for barely 2</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25727-3
04:47:14.977 --> 04:47:16.877
<v Ricky Horton>years. Why are the batteries working?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25728-0
04:47:18.717 --> 04:47:19.117
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25729-0
04:47:22.317 --> 04:47:22.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25741-0
04:47:24.317 --> 04:47:32.837
<v Ricky Horton>We'll make it work, yeah.
So what's going here like 10 million here?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25763-0
04:47:34.317 --> 04:47:40.249
<v Ricky Horton>I think at least the goal is to do at
least 30 million next year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25763-1
04:47:40.249 --> 04:47:45.733
<v Ricky Horton>So it's going to take a little bit. Yeah,
we've got to sell.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25763-2
04:47:45.733 --> 04:47:50.677
<v Ricky Horton>You might have got to get equipment to do,
go do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25765-0
04:47:51.797 --> 04:47:51.957
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25771-0
04:47:53.197 --> 04:47:57.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it has. We just need somebody to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25775-0
04:47:57.917 --> 04:48:01.117
<v Ricky Horton>Now we're confident.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25782-0
04:48:10.917 --> 04:48:15.557
<v Ricky Horton>Never justifiable recently.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25788-0
04:48:20.317 --> 04:48:22.757
<v Ricky Horton>Working and going anywhere in the valley.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25799-0
04:48:23.837 --> 04:48:26.408
<v Ricky Horton>Well, The thing is,
is this job that we're going to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25799-1
04:48:26.408 --> 04:48:27.157
<v Ricky Horton>installed along.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25817-0
04:48:29.437 --> 04:48:34.059
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know who estimated it.
They estimated bidders back or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25817-1
04:48:34.059 --> 04:48:38.011
<v Ricky Horton>subcontract,
but the jobs are actually being shipped</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25817-2
04:48:38.011 --> 04:48:38.757
<v Ricky Horton>from then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25851-0
04:48:39.837 --> 04:48:44.603
<v Ricky Horton>That's just what's not mine.
It's like somebody in the land won this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25851-1
04:48:44.603 --> 04:48:47.504
<v Ricky Horton>job,
and I think they won it because they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25851-2
04:48:47.504 --> 04:48:51.856
<v Ricky Horton>didn't bring the job.
But there's no reason that a shop in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25851-3
04:48:51.856 --> 04:48:54.757
<v Ricky Horton>land should be competitive here, here and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25856-0
04:48:55.117 --> 04:48:57.757
<v Ricky Horton>Just outside just north of Phoenix and
Clarksdale.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25857-0
04:48:59.557 --> 04:48:59.997
<v Ricky Horton>Ouch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25890-0
04:49:01.437 --> 04:49:04.054
<v Ricky Horton>But I think that's what everybody's
saying.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25890-1
04:49:04.054 --> 04:49:07.088
<v Ricky Horton>There's no reason like if I think in the
pipeline,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25890-2
04:49:07.088 --> 04:49:10.717
<v Ricky Horton>if we were to look at what's in that type
of sales pipeline,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25890-3
04:49:10.717 --> 04:49:13.037
<v Ricky Horton>if they can self perform, you can just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25924-0
04:49:13.877 --> 04:49:16.962
<v Ricky Horton>Farm that out.
The question I have is how quickly can we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25924-1
04:49:16.962 --> 04:49:19.614
<v Ricky Horton>look to the sales pipeline to see
anything else?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25924-2
04:49:19.614 --> 04:49:23.457
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think we're ever going to be able
to. Everest too strong work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25924-3
04:49:23.457 --> 04:49:26.597
<v Ricky Horton>Bechtel is just not going to be a job
that fits here for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25930-0
04:49:27.717 --> 04:49:32.217
<v Ricky Horton>A lot.
I think you can see what they do with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25930-1
04:49:32.217 --> 04:49:34.517
<v Ricky Horton>that one. Me too. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25982-0
04:49:37.917 --> 04:49:42.077
<v Ricky Horton>And Bechtel's a bullet.
Bechtel's a difficult customer.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25982-1
04:49:42.077 --> 04:49:47.574
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody's worked for Bechtel.
I don't know. Oh, they're brutal. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25982-2
04:49:47.574 --> 04:49:52.031
<v Ricky Horton>documentation. I look at,
I look at the drawings. They got,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25982-3
04:49:52.031 --> 04:49:55.300
<v Ricky Horton>they got some open welds.
It's not too bad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/25982-4
04:49:55.300 --> 04:49:57.677
<v Ricky Horton>Nothing really unusual about it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26000-0
04:49:57.717 --> 04:50:03.828
<v Ricky Horton>But it's for years that it's like, oh,
the pipe racks are just like this call to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26000-1
04:50:03.828 --> 04:50:06.997
<v Ricky Horton>the baby crisis, you know? So it's pretty.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26026-0
04:50:07.997 --> 04:50:13.073
<v Ricky Horton>But I think the trick is job,
but I don't think we're set up here to do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26026-1
04:50:13.073 --> 04:50:16.317
<v Ricky Horton>it.
You get the drawings in November 26th and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26026-2
04:50:16.317 --> 04:50:20.477
<v Ricky Horton>you got to deliver 7000 tons in March of
27. Yeah, that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26047-0
04:50:21.557 --> 04:50:24.681
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
it just means that some they haven't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26047-1
04:50:24.681 --> 04:50:29.154
<v Ricky Horton>They're they're not even ready to at
least because they don't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26047-2
04:50:29.154 --> 04:50:30.717
<v Ricky Horton>They didn't have them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26102-0
04:50:32.037 --> 04:50:36.475
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I was asking, can we have the Tekla?
I mean, I stopped. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26102-1
04:50:36.475 --> 04:50:40.912
<v Ricky Horton>the time is pretty fun too.
It's like really good to tell this size</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26102-2
04:50:40.912 --> 04:50:45.546
<v Ricky Horton>in that short period of time.
They gave it to us a week ago and then I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26102-3
04:50:45.546 --> 04:50:51.094
<v Ricky Horton>did yesterday or day before the other day.
So the truth of that is that thing if you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26102-4
04:50:51.094 --> 04:50:51.877
<v Ricky Horton>look at the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26131-0
04:50:51.877 --> 04:50:57.861
<v Ricky Horton>You know, I don't know if you've seen the,
I haven't seen that effort.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26131-1
04:50:57.861 --> 04:51:04.436
<v Ricky Horton>So we sat on and I think like 2 months,
yeah, I don't know if I can see that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26131-2
04:51:04.436 --> 04:51:09.157
<v Ricky Horton>but I think it actually came from
somebody from Denver.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26170-0
04:51:09.157 --> 04:51:12.808
<v Ricky Horton>That heard about this and look,
I don't think it was here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26170-1
04:51:12.808 --> 04:51:17.945
<v Ricky Horton>I think it was stuck somewhere else and
then they gave an extension till the 22nd,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26170-2
04:51:17.945 --> 04:51:21.411
<v Ricky Horton>like March when they got to the 22nd to
put the bid in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26170-3
04:51:21.411 --> 04:51:24.197
<v Ricky Horton>So how are we going to make it better
today?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26200-0
04:51:25.477 --> 04:51:30.830
<v Ricky Horton>Or not. It's just a bidding exercise.
People are going to find out that Bechtel</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26200-1
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:34.845
<v Ricky Horton>shops well and there's going to be.
This is my gut feeling.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26200-2
04:51:34.845 --> 04:51:39.597
<v Ricky Horton>I was trying to figure out what the
closest historical shop was to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26204-0
04:51:40.757 --> 04:51:42.317
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause there's not much out there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26228-0
04:51:43.077 --> 04:51:50.371
<v Ricky Horton>Salt Lake City must have a good
fabrication SMV. That's Salt Lake City.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26228-1
04:51:50.371 --> 04:51:56.550
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, they probably are.
It's probably the preferred shot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26228-2
04:51:56.550 --> 04:52:01.717
<v Ricky Horton>It's so close. Yeah,
I don't believe you think so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26250-0
04:52:02.077 --> 04:52:09.749
<v Ricky Horton>So send them all over.
That's really has enough backlog right</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26250-1
04:52:09.749 --> 04:52:17.917
<v Ricky Horton>now. Yeah, but I'm we'll see her.
Maybe I'm close to backlog too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26297-0
04:52:18.197 --> 04:52:23.208
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, that is.
They had one really busy shop and I went</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26297-1
04:52:23.208 --> 04:52:29.108
<v Ricky Horton>like eight or nine months ago.
I was in the shop in Salt Lake and I went</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26297-2
04:52:29.108 --> 04:52:34.362
<v Ricky Horton>to actually just have that.
Then I went to the in Nevada after I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26297-3
04:52:34.362 --> 04:52:37.757
<v Ricky Horton>didn't take the job in Salt Lake and they.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26327-0
04:52:37.797 --> 04:52:43.487
<v Ricky Horton>I was already working in Nevada.
I can be there at the what's it called</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26327-1
04:52:43.487 --> 04:52:47.438
<v Ricky Horton>Southwest.
So I went there and I toured that shop</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26327-2
04:52:47.438 --> 04:52:53.760
<v Ricky Horton>and talked with them and they kind of
laughed and said I'm not even looking for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26327-3
04:52:53.760 --> 04:52:57.317
<v Ricky Horton>the people that are hiring to meet them.
OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26339-0
04:52:57.997 --> 04:53:01.364
<v Ricky Horton>See, yeah.
And I know they have one up here too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26339-1
04:53:01.364 --> 04:53:05.557
<v Ricky Horton>And maybe they got a shop here. Yeah,
they have a shop here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26349-0
04:53:06.637 --> 04:53:14.088
<v Ricky Horton>It's way too far away from my house.
It's like, all right, I have two hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26349-1
04:53:14.088 --> 04:53:21.637
<v Ricky Horton>It's out there. I need some money.
Wait it all like, no, I'm not going there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26385-0
04:53:21.757 --> 04:53:26.869
<v Ricky Horton>So there's in in Salt Lake,
just a little South of Salt Lake.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26385-1
04:53:26.869 --> 04:53:31.815
<v Ricky Horton>It's something called.
I actually wanted me to manage their</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26385-2
04:53:31.815 --> 04:53:37.340
<v Ricky Horton>their their TSMC jobs. OK,
I don't want to drive to TSMC every day</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26385-3
04:53:37.340 --> 04:53:37.917
<v Ricky Horton>either.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26400-0
04:53:39.157 --> 04:53:46.654
<v Ricky Horton>These aren't is there structural ceiling
plate, which is north of Salt Lake,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26400-1
04:53:46.654 --> 04:53:48.797
<v Ricky Horton>where I was last week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26420-0
04:53:50.037 --> 04:54:00.133
<v Ricky Horton>JT Steel is literally about two blocks
from that setting. I really like this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26420-1
04:54:00.133 --> 04:54:01.557
<v Ricky Horton>so they do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26455-0
04:54:02.517 --> 04:54:09.453
<v Ricky Horton>I have a little bit of work out,
but these are when I was in the Fresno</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26455-1
04:54:09.453 --> 04:54:14.174
<v Ricky Horton>government, right?
We need some like this stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26455-2
04:54:14.174 --> 04:54:20.437
<v Ricky Horton>So I need to be sorry. What's that?
What do you think these are?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26484-0
04:54:20.837 --> 04:54:26.335
<v Ricky Horton>I thought, you know,
art in the name had something to do with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26484-1
04:54:26.335 --> 04:54:32.365
<v Ricky Horton>welding, but it's not. When I did this,
is everybody told me crazy?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26484-2
04:54:32.365 --> 04:54:37.597
<v Ricky Horton>You think that the attorneys are correct?
This says CRZCR.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26502-0
04:54:38.597 --> 04:54:50.637
<v Ricky Horton>You know, I like that. There you go.
That's what you're seeing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26503-0
04:54:52.837 --> 04:54:56.277
<v Ricky Horton>I know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26509-0
04:55:20.197 --> 04:55:26.797
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's getting a great even want.
I want to do business with them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26536-0
04:55:28.277 --> 04:55:33.500
<v Ricky Horton>But they want to sell us plate with a
semi truck load.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26536-1
04:55:33.500 --> 04:55:41.192
<v Ricky Horton>Who's that Friedman Industries and we
don't. It'd be one thing if we took plate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26536-2
04:55:41.192 --> 04:55:42.997
<v Ricky Horton>sold it to the job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26574-0
04:55:43.637 --> 04:55:49.373
<v Ricky Horton>For usage, but usually we're buying job.
So these guys want us to buy and we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26574-1
04:55:49.373 --> 04:55:53.389
<v Ricky Horton>getting, you know,
it doesn't have to be one whole semi</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26574-2
04:55:53.389 --> 04:55:56.544
<v Ricky Horton>truckload of one size. That's fine.
I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26574-3
04:55:56.544 --> 04:55:59.197
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have time to run like I need.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26593-0
04:55:59.797 --> 04:56:08.010
<v Ricky Horton>896 two 40s quarter range,
896 two 40s and 3688 and I like that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26593-1
04:56:08.010 --> 04:56:12.117
<v Ricky Horton>kind of wild and they got insane.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26615-0
04:56:13.077 --> 04:56:19.550
<v Ricky Horton>One inch through through 316.
I think that's the lowest they go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26615-1
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:24.928
<v Ricky Horton>They'll sell me 964 is at 46 cents a
pound delivered.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26615-2
04:56:24.928 --> 04:56:27.717
<v Ricky Horton>And what is like Smith sell?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26643-0
04:56:28.197 --> 04:56:33.971
<v Ricky Horton>They're around 64 to 67,
so that's not Texas.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26643-1
04:56:33.971 --> 04:56:43.637
<v Ricky Horton>They'll deliver it cause they got trucks
coming into the valley and they'll.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26679-0
04:56:43.997 --> 04:56:47.137
<v Ricky Horton>And give it to me at that price,
which is great.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26679-1
04:56:47.137 --> 04:56:52.328
<v Ricky Horton>I just can't justify the freaking plate.
I don't have and that's kind of why I'm</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26679-2
04:56:52.328 --> 04:56:56.943
<v Ricky Horton>pushing to get this in the process
because if I can have a solid plate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26679-3
04:56:56.943 --> 04:57:01.237
<v Ricky Horton>I just start selling parts for the jobs
and track usages and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26718-0
04:57:01.237 --> 04:57:04.639
<v Ricky Horton>Divide and conquer and skeleton
definitely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26718-1
04:57:04.639 --> 04:57:10.362
<v Ricky Horton>But at least I've got a good plate
inventory I can plug cost into and and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26718-2
04:57:10.362 --> 04:57:16.007
<v Ricky Horton>then quote it out to myself. Yeah,
and and do kind of an internal thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26718-3
04:57:16.007 --> 04:57:18.637
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, that sounds all very good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26751-0
04:57:18.917 --> 04:57:23.600
<v Ricky Horton>I want to use the word easy,
but I don't want to use it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26751-1
04:57:23.600 --> 04:57:29.515
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think this is really a a super,
super simple system. Yeah, I I,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26751-2
04:57:29.515 --> 04:57:35.677
<v Ricky Horton>I that's why I picked up super quick.
So yeah, they do have the best data.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26757-0
04:57:36.037 --> 04:57:38.545
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
of all of the I've heard that they put</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26757-1
04:57:38.545 --> 04:57:41.277
<v Ricky Horton>good things that they're like the best
there is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26803-0
04:57:42.997 --> 04:57:51.168
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's the thing though.
He beats everybody's prices here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26803-1
04:57:51.168 --> 04:58:01.477
<v Ricky Horton>And then I go to the ACCV and I'll have
this guy who's getting 26 cents a volume.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26842-0
04:58:02.197 --> 04:58:07.581
<v Ricky Horton>You have the structural.
So how's that work though? Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26842-1
04:58:07.581 --> 04:58:13.800
<v Ricky Horton>they pick up our material,
take it over their gown and I can bring</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26842-2
04:58:13.800 --> 04:58:20.948
<v Ricky Horton>back. So it's really affecting us,
but maybe we have a they get stuff across</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26842-3
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:21.877
<v Ricky Horton>the board.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26877-0
04:58:22.037 --> 04:58:26.591
<v Ricky Horton>But my issue,
I don't be able to act the trucks to get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26877-1
04:58:26.591 --> 04:58:30.732
<v Ricky Horton>that done.
There's there's times where like it'll</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26877-2
04:58:30.732 --> 04:58:37.440
<v Ricky Horton>get moving up in customs if we have one
extra piece up and then they also behind</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26877-3
04:58:37.440 --> 04:58:38.517
<v Ricky Horton>all the MTRS.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26917-0
04:58:38.997 --> 04:58:43.234
<v Ricky Horton>ACZ that I have, by the way,
you added two extra visas because there</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26917-1
04:58:43.234 --> 04:58:46.243
<v Ricky Horton>was nothing good to go.
That's going to stop me.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26917-2
04:58:46.243 --> 04:58:50.972
<v Ricky Horton>So my problem with it is either they
don't usually get back to me, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26917-3
04:58:50.972 --> 04:58:55.517
<v Ricky Horton>I can't find out stuff, you know,
you got to have a couple names to call.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26949-0
04:58:55.877 --> 04:59:02.217
<v Ricky Horton>Oscar and somebody else is like,
it's like, yeah, I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26949-1
04:59:02.217 --> 04:59:10.044
<v Ricky Horton>Ours is pretty good. Yeah, pretty good.
Back and forth with them. That's good,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26949-2
04:59:10.044 --> 04:59:10.837
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26985-0
04:59:11.157 --> 04:59:17.700
<v Ricky Horton>Good portion of all my projects this year.
Really. So and then even, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26985-1
04:59:17.700 --> 04:59:23.818
<v Ricky Horton>they stored materials at their facility
for us for also the two months.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/26985-2
04:59:23.818 --> 04:59:28.237
<v Ricky Horton>Are they the ones that are in the area?
Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27021-0
04:59:28.677 --> 04:59:32.642
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I've got. Our next,
the next level. Yep,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27021-1
04:59:32.642 --> 04:59:36.083
<v Ricky Horton>they're in the back end or something.
I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27021-2
04:59:36.083 --> 04:59:42.143
<v Ricky Horton>they've been around for forever as far as
I know. So, yeah, well, they got that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27021-3
04:59:42.143 --> 04:59:44.837
<v Ricky Horton>I'm already expecting to heard that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27047-0
04:59:44.837 --> 04:59:49.358
<v Ricky Horton>I heard the whole Mexico thing.
I've never heard that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27047-1
04:59:49.358 --> 04:59:52.975
<v Ricky Horton>I think they're what, Mexicani? Yeah,
yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27047-2
04:59:52.975 --> 04:59:59.141
<v Ricky Horton>Mark and Rabino and Chris all the way
down there into the facility down in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27047-3
04:59:59.141 --> 04:59:59.717
<v Ricky Horton>Mexico.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27078-0
05:00:00.197 --> 05:00:05.037
<v Ricky Horton>In that it it sounds like they run up the
far. They keep all the,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27078-1
05:00:05.037 --> 05:00:09.657
<v Ricky Horton>they keep all the workers,
they have stores for them in there,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27078-2
05:00:09.657 --> 05:00:14.863
<v Ricky Horton>so they keep the guys healthy and
everything's all running to the T in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27078-3
05:00:14.863 --> 05:00:16.477
<v Ricky Horton>there, very organized.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27082-0
05:00:16.637 --> 05:00:18.957
<v Ricky Horton>This is still trust the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27084-0
05:00:20.437 --> 05:00:23.477
<v Ricky Horton>Stuff leaving our facility sometimes, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27101-0
05:00:25.477 --> 05:00:31.216
<v Ricky Horton>There was a while there we got into the
thick of the gravel because we couldn't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27101-1
05:00:31.216 --> 05:00:34.157
<v Ricky Horton>get a damn truck raid, so that was there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27134-0
05:00:37.717 --> 05:00:47.787
<v Ricky Horton>Looks like your maintenance expired on
1/30/25. Yeah, that was a while ago.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27134-1
05:00:47.787 --> 05:00:54.544
<v Ricky Horton>Reinstates maintenance,
one of the set price 2025.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27134-2
05:00:54.544 --> 05:00:56.797
<v Ricky Horton>I'll maintenance.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27150-0
05:00:57.157 --> 05:01:05.006
<v Ricky Horton>It's be on bottom and post as they can be
directed to Papa Connector based on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27150-1
05:01:05.006 --> 05:01:11.037
<v Ricky Horton>training technical support.
The only thing I also need is the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27167-0
05:01:12.197 --> 05:01:16.127
<v Ricky Horton>Cutting edge, cutting.
I want all of their modules.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27167-1
05:01:16.127 --> 05:01:21.493
<v Ricky Horton>There's been no reason my brother
shouldn't have every module possible</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27167-2
05:01:21.493 --> 05:01:24.517
<v Ricky Horton>unless my machine is restricted on that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27208-0
05:01:27.197 --> 05:01:32.007
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that was pretty close.
I told him to be about 16 grams,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27208-1
05:01:32.007 --> 05:01:37.940
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm guessing once they add on the on
the add. Mark's copy of this one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27208-2
05:01:37.940 --> 05:01:43.793
<v Ricky Horton>My guess is we'll probably get this one
replaced tomorrow, so in theory,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27208-3
05:01:43.793 --> 05:01:45.557
<v Ricky Horton>depending on how long.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27216-0
05:01:46.837 --> 05:01:51.877
<v Ricky Horton>This process goes to and might be able to
get this stuff pushed me on Friday. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27216-1
05:01:51.877 --> 05:01:54.877
<v Ricky Horton>awesome.
We can get a little chunk out of it, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27221-0
05:01:55.997 --> 05:02:00.237
<v Ricky Horton>But you know, that'll work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27234-0
05:02:04.077 --> 05:02:12.397
<v Ricky Horton>Let's do a quick test and see if we can
get into port 307.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27239-0
05:02:38.477 --> 05:02:39.917
<v Ricky Horton>That's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27241-0
05:02:57.757 --> 05:02:58.237
<v Ricky Horton>That.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27248-0
05:03:08.197 --> 05:03:12.197
<v Ricky Horton>Go back to your um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27251-0
05:03:13.437 --> 05:03:15.197
<v Ricky Horton>That picture's really there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27273-0
05:03:26.197 --> 05:03:31.299
<v Ricky Horton>One thing that I'm questioning here is
the text about if I directly left bottom</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27273-1
05:03:31.299 --> 05:03:33.277
<v Ricky Horton>right doesn't have it directly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27304-0
05:03:34.757 --> 05:03:41.533
<v Ricky Horton>That points to where the program actually
is. I mean it it could be like mine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27304-1
05:03:41.533 --> 05:03:48.309
<v Ricky Horton>I have. I can run multiple versions,
so that points to which version I want to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27304-2
05:03:48.309 --> 05:03:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>be running for that database.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27314-0
05:03:51.077 --> 05:03:55.777
<v Ricky Horton>It may be with only one,
it just force the right one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27314-1
05:03:55.777 --> 05:04:00.477
<v Ricky Horton>I don't notice it,
but it's just different than mine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27315-0
05:04:03.157 --> 05:04:03.277
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27334-0
05:04:15.317 --> 05:04:19.432
<v Ricky Horton>So he said,
I don't see any reason why it would be a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27334-1
05:04:19.432 --> 05:04:23.237
<v Ricky Horton>different be a recipe because same server,
same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27357-0
05:04:24.277 --> 05:04:29.176
<v Ricky Horton>Unless it's just not about,
I mean they can have, they can start it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27357-1
05:04:29.176 --> 05:04:33.223
<v Ricky Horton>but I mean they can create it and not
start the service.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27357-2
05:04:33.223 --> 05:04:35.637
<v Ricky Horton>That might be the the other thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27361-0
05:04:37.237 --> 05:04:40.477
<v Ricky Horton>While I was trying to pull the picture
back up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27383-0
05:04:42.797 --> 05:04:48.069
<v Ricky Horton>Please follow up.
So you see that Bob or stop service yards.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27383-1
05:04:48.069 --> 05:04:53.169
<v Ricky Horton>So usually it's just like,
but that was whatever that was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27383-2
05:04:53.169 --> 05:04:57.837
<v Ricky Horton>So I think I don't know. Yeah,
that was this morning.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27386-0
05:05:01.557 --> 05:05:06.597
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean the iterations work there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27389-0
05:05:11.957 --> 05:05:14.677
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I mean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27391-0
05:05:19.117 --> 05:05:26.517
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, that's it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27392-0
05:05:27.197 --> 05:05:27.277
<v Ricky Horton>Hey.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27403-0
05:05:31.317 --> 05:05:43.197
<v Ricky Horton>See you in the college.
So for have we submitted everything for?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27411-0
05:06:06.717 --> 05:06:08.237
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27412-0
05:06:16.517 --> 05:06:16.717
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27431-0
05:07:02.037 --> 05:07:10.997
<v Ricky Horton>This is probably a crunch. It's it's the.
Yeah, you're asking me to look where?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27437-0
05:07:19.637 --> 05:07:23.557
<v Ricky Horton>I think just that port or that IP address
is not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27438-0
05:07:31.157 --> 05:07:31.277
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27439-0
05:07:32.997 --> 05:07:33.317
<v Ricky Horton>I love you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27443-0
05:07:36.157 --> 05:07:37.837
<v Ricky Horton>Are you just testing the imports?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27444-0
05:07:42.077 --> 05:07:42.717
<v Ricky Horton>Right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27445-0
05:07:50.117 --> 05:07:50.957
<v Ricky Horton>But it's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27455-0
05:07:54.837 --> 05:08:03.117
<v Ricky Horton>What's the default? 15 and six? Yeah,
15 and six. It is one gives us an.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27457-0
05:08:06.557 --> 05:08:06.917
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27464-0
05:08:10.957 --> 05:08:14.957
<v Ricky Horton>I see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27475-0
05:08:24.517 --> 05:08:27.357
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he just wants to go on the tool.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27499-0
05:10:39.957 --> 05:10:42.957
<v Ricky Horton>I think you should be very good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27523-0
05:10:54.997 --> 05:11:01.235
<v Ricky Horton>Diversity of IT.
That's seems to be the problem there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27523-1
05:11:01.235 --> 05:11:10.197
<v Ricky Horton>I was used to the luxury of just walking
out of certainly, yeah, I guess that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27542-0
05:11:27.037 --> 05:11:42.197
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two, I got a 12.
What a combo. Yeah, two different ones.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27547-0
05:11:49.197 --> 05:11:52.597
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I love that you're here,
but you did.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27549-0
05:11:54.037 --> 05:11:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27554-0
05:11:56.557 --> 05:12:01.317
<v Ricky Horton>Ball and that was a normal Blue Healer.
He's uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27559-0
05:12:02.477 --> 05:12:07.757
<v Ricky Horton>When you're when you're eight months.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27577-0
05:12:09.317 --> 05:12:15.131
<v Ricky Horton>The development of a,
we'll be able to kind of bring them down</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27577-1
05:12:15.131 --> 05:12:22.237
<v Ricky Horton>in some ways. Yeah, definitely got to.
If we were building, face and energy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27579-0
05:12:29.397 --> 05:12:32.437
<v Ricky Horton>I love that dog,
but I've just never owned it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27589-0
05:12:34.957 --> 05:12:38.397
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I want the place a little bit
bigger yard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27595-0
05:12:43.277 --> 05:12:49.877
<v Ricky Horton>20 acres so they can just go wrong.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27596-0
05:12:52.077 --> 05:12:52.117
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27598-0
05:12:56.477 --> 05:13:01.717
<v Ricky Horton>You'll share.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27611-0
05:13:03.357 --> 05:13:08.388
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool. Yeah, that's my new one.
My first one made me want another one in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27611-1
05:13:08.388 --> 05:13:11.037
<v Ricky Horton>my second. It seems we have a lot other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27627-0
05:13:13.837 --> 05:13:17.821
<v Ricky Horton>All right, look at this. Excuse me,
thank you very much. What's up, man?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27627-1
05:13:17.821 --> 05:13:20.877
<v Ricky Horton>I'm running an official name here.
Why you got an exam?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27662-0
05:13:22.997 --> 05:13:27.060
<v Ricky Horton>I meant the other things, but uh,
it was more automatic.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27662-1
05:13:27.060 --> 05:13:32.905
<v Ricky Horton>So that's actually we're waiting for IT
is probably restarting the server because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27662-2
05:13:32.905 --> 05:13:37.610
<v Ricky Horton>we're having the server connection should
be in like, yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27662-3
05:13:37.610 --> 05:13:41.317
<v Ricky Horton>the next one is our regular ones working
just fine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27669-0
05:13:41.397 --> 05:13:47.037
<v Ricky Horton>It's just this new port and not having to
talk with it so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27675-0
05:13:48.997 --> 05:13:53.277
<v Ricky Horton>But we can at least go over kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27713-0
05:13:54.477 --> 05:13:59.216
<v Ricky Horton>What items you're looking for in there,
I'm assuming probably pretty similar to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27713-1
05:13:59.216 --> 05:14:01.940
<v Ricky Horton>like the ROQ stuff we've been known for
wire.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27713-2
05:14:01.940 --> 05:14:06.679
<v Ricky Horton>We want to get a place of wire broke out
in there and cages and and purchase of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27713-3
05:14:06.679 --> 05:14:09.997
<v Ricky Horton>the lengths of the wire and then
purchasable items for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27736-0
05:14:10.197 --> 05:14:18.984
<v Ricky Horton>I guess bio items for electrical stuff
and that I hopefully will never happen to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27736-1
05:14:18.984 --> 05:14:25.277
<v Ricky Horton>the wire again because it's extremely
stressful or in to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27762-0
05:14:26.117 --> 05:14:32.981
<v Ricky Horton>But then you only have like 100 feet to
drop. But yeah, boom. Um on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27762-1
05:14:32.981 --> 05:14:39.050
<v Ricky Horton>I mean it's like 47,000 feet. But um,
the idea, the biggest,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27762-2
05:14:39.050 --> 05:14:41.637
<v Ricky Horton>the biggest concept um is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27795-0
05:14:42.837 --> 05:14:48.191
<v Ricky Horton>We're putting a lot of effort within BIM
modeling on the electrical side from,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27795-1
05:14:48.191 --> 05:14:51.919
<v Ricky Horton>let's just say,
just supports right from any standards</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27795-2
05:14:51.919 --> 05:14:54.969
<v Ricky Horton>from.
The level of detail we're having to go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27795-3
05:14:54.969 --> 05:14:57.477
<v Ricky Horton>through for a lot of these models is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27839-0
05:14:58.277 --> 05:15:02.890
<v Ricky Horton>I mean it's it's an LD 400,
so it's we're modeling nuts and washers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27839-1
05:15:02.890 --> 05:15:05.965
<v Ricky Horton>right,
as we're getting it's pretty accurate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27839-2
05:15:05.965 --> 05:15:09.441
<v Ricky Horton>So since we're putting such a cost into
doing this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27839-3
05:15:09.441 --> 05:15:14.455
<v Ricky Horton>I want to be able to leverage the
abilities that we have within Tekla from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27839-4
05:15:14.455 --> 05:15:17.397
<v Ricky Horton>a nesting and assembly tracking
standpoint.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27850-0
05:15:17.637 --> 05:15:25.793
<v Ricky Horton>So that we can actually run it through as
this if it were a structural building,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27850-1
05:15:25.793 --> 05:15:26.397
<v Ricky Horton>right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27888-0
05:15:27.637 --> 05:15:33.129
<v Ricky Horton>And where I'm running into is it's where
all the assemblies are for the most part</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27888-1
05:15:33.129 --> 05:15:36.143
<v Ricky Horton>unique from a strut length and a rod
length.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27888-2
05:15:36.143 --> 05:15:41.301
<v Ricky Horton>But from the grand scheme of things,
there's only like 10 different types of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27888-3
05:15:41.301 --> 05:15:41.837
<v Ricky Horton>designs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27931-0
05:15:43.277 --> 05:15:48.288
<v Ricky Horton>Realistically what we're doing and then,
but everything's done from Revit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27931-1
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:53.032
<v Ricky Horton>So if I do just an IFC export out of
Revit, I lose all of my metadata.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27931-2
05:15:53.032 --> 05:15:58.110
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't really know that it's a people.
I don't know it's half the draw,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27931-3
05:15:58.110 --> 05:16:00.917
<v Ricky Horton>it's just a body shape there, right? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27976-0
05:16:03.117 --> 05:16:05.898
<v Ricky Horton>So what I've been working on is within
Reddit,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27976-1
05:16:05.898 --> 05:16:10.631
<v Ricky Horton>I can actually create a BOM that has a
set parameters in it and we can actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27976-2
05:16:10.631 --> 05:16:15.306
<v Ricky Horton>create an Excel spreadsheet that defines
what those are and if we can leverage</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/27976-3
05:16:15.306 --> 05:16:18.797
<v Ricky Horton>that Excel spreadsheet where we can bring
that into Tekla.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28023-0
05:16:19.077 --> 05:16:24.229
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla doesn't need to know that it's the
exact body from the model standpoint.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28023-1
05:16:24.229 --> 05:16:28.273
<v Ricky Horton>They just need to know how to correlate
it to a P1000, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28023-2
05:16:28.273 --> 05:16:33.622
<v Ricky Horton>And so if we can come up with that system
and figure out a way to carry those cut</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28023-3
05:16:33.622 --> 05:16:36.557
<v Ricky Horton>lengths and just the overall assembly
types.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28074-0
05:16:36.917 --> 05:16:42.288
<v Ricky Horton>I think we could just treat it as if it
were a fabric and we can still do our</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28074-1
05:16:42.288 --> 05:16:47.039
<v Ricky Horton>RFQs, we can still do nestings,
we can still do assembly, shippings,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28074-2
05:16:47.039 --> 05:16:51.240
<v Ricky Horton>everything like that.
And so our electric prefab where we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28074-3
05:16:51.240 --> 05:16:54.477
<v Ricky Horton>talking,
I mean thousands of trapeze supports.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28108-0
05:16:54.837 --> 05:16:58.874
<v Ricky Horton>We can, you know,
do the same thing where the saw operator</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28108-1
05:16:58.874 --> 05:17:03.595
<v Ricky Horton>only needs to care about his cutlass
basically given that day. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28108-2
05:17:03.595 --> 05:17:08.043
<v Ricky Horton>And then go from there.
So that's like the big picture design of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28108-3
05:17:08.043 --> 05:17:10.917
<v Ricky Horton>what we're trying to accomplish. So I can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28120-0
05:17:11.157 --> 05:17:17.451
<v Ricky Horton>So they're so you're make sure I
understand someone will repeat back what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28120-1
05:17:17.451 --> 05:17:19.237
<v Ricky Horton>I think I understand.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28168-0
05:17:21.237 --> 05:17:24.866
<v Ricky Horton>You're looking to,
you're working on exporting out to do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28168-1
05:17:24.866 --> 05:17:27.986
<v Ricky Horton>Excel.
We get the right format to bring in here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28168-2
05:17:27.986 --> 05:17:33.080
<v Ricky Horton>then we will do the next thing and order
the next thing and everything exactly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28168-3
05:17:33.080 --> 05:17:38.302
<v Ricky Horton>So we can consider bringing a kiss file,
I think, and I'm not set on Excel files,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28168-4
05:17:38.302 --> 05:17:38.557
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28199-0
05:17:38.997 --> 05:17:45.613
<v Ricky Horton>And it's been the easiest thing that we
can clearly define what that material is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28199-1
05:17:45.613 --> 05:17:52.066
<v Ricky Horton>is from itself and then and then I've
developed it's been working so far as my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28199-2
05:17:52.066 --> 05:17:54.517
<v Ricky Horton>gaming convention on like a a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28211-0
05:17:55.797 --> 05:18:02.357
<v Ricky Horton>TR1 is the single tier trippy support and
then we come up with you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28251-0
05:18:03.237 --> 05:18:08.731
<v Ricky Horton>All the they're all usually typically
rods and then like AB would be in the top</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28251-1
05:18:08.731 --> 05:18:14.293
<v Ricky Horton>end connection would be a beam plant on
one side and like a big half inch spring</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28251-2
05:18:14.293 --> 05:18:18.277
<v Ricky Horton>nut on the other side or something. Yeah,
I can show you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28289-0
05:18:21.677 --> 05:18:28.561
<v Ricky Horton>But I think cause I can build a VOM
within Revit to meet whatever parameters</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28289-1
05:18:28.561 --> 05:18:33.656
<v Ricky Horton>we need. Yeah,
but then I can give you the import table.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28289-2
05:18:33.656 --> 05:18:41.077
<v Ricky Horton>OK and it it has a lot of lot of fields
on it and I'll show you the ones that are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28326-0
05:18:41.077 --> 05:18:45.094
<v Ricky Horton>The required here,
the nice part is what you guys were doing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28326-1
05:18:45.094 --> 05:18:48.783
<v Ricky Horton>with like the material database is
especially on strat.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28326-2
05:18:48.783 --> 05:18:53.854
<v Ricky Horton>It's the same thing we did on Eagle is
you're gonna have just a standard key</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28326-3
05:18:53.854 --> 05:18:57.477
<v Ricky Horton>1000 P 1001 and they're pretty unique
shapes and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28339-0
05:18:57.477 --> 05:19:02.354
<v Ricky Horton>We're talking, you know, yeah,
my scene for code and there's not those</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28339-1
05:19:02.354 --> 05:19:05.445
<v Ricky Horton>things,
but there's there's not a lot of big</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28339-2
05:19:05.445 --> 05:19:07.437
<v Ricky Horton>field that we have to create.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28351-0
05:19:10.997 --> 05:19:18.357
<v Ricky Horton>That's possible in my head.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28391-0
05:19:19.797 --> 05:19:25.623
<v Ricky Horton>But we're we're spending so much money
just to get to the level of detail that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28391-1
05:19:25.623 --> 05:19:29.901
<v Ricky Horton>are are a lot of our binge requirements
we're installing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28391-2
05:19:29.901 --> 05:19:34.031
<v Ricky Horton>we're required to install within eight to
what we want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28391-3
05:19:34.031 --> 05:19:39.637
<v Ricky Horton>So at least you're whereas after you can
view from a a design execution so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28396-0
05:19:39.717 --> 05:19:41.757
<v Ricky Horton>We might as well be fabricating it to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28437-0
05:19:46.197 --> 05:19:51.233
<v Ricky Horton>And So what I what we've done in the past
so far is like I would send the these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28437-1
05:19:51.233 --> 05:19:56.269
<v Ricky Horton>guys just a a list of strut links right
or a list of raw links or anything like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28437-2
05:19:56.269 --> 05:20:01.557
<v Ricky Horton>that and they just kind of mainly put it
in and then give you a a deliverable back.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28442-0
05:20:02.597 --> 05:20:06.369
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
but definitely want to take it a step</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28442-1
05:20:06.369 --> 05:20:07.357
<v Ricky Horton>further on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28487-0
05:20:11.037 --> 05:20:14.111
<v Ricky Horton>Probably having those sizes to be
portable, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28487-1
05:20:14.111 --> 05:20:18.969
<v Ricky Horton>And then I still think we just have the
flexibility of doing the one offs like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28487-2
05:20:18.969 --> 05:20:22.966
<v Ricky Horton>this wire thing, yeah.
And because I don't think that's anything</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28487-3
05:20:22.966 --> 05:20:26.717
<v Ricky Horton>we want to build into our system as far
as wire links, it's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28535-0
05:20:26.757 --> 05:20:31.493
<v Ricky Horton>This is just kind of a one-off deal.
We're we're pretty much talking about</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28535-1
05:20:31.493 --> 05:20:36.229
<v Ricky Horton>linear, linear stuff. Yes, Sir.
It's not a nesting of a plate or anything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28535-2
05:20:36.229 --> 05:20:40.524
<v Ricky Horton>No, it's not a width length like things.
It's just a linear length.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28535-3
05:20:40.524 --> 05:20:44.565
<v Ricky Horton>And then we just bring our, you know,
curves down to, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28535-4
05:20:44.565 --> 05:20:46.397
<v Ricky Horton>as it's like a sheer nesting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28544-0
05:20:46.637 --> 05:20:50.781
<v Ricky Horton>Like it's theoretically not, you know,
we don't have, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28544-1
05:20:50.781 --> 05:20:53.437
<v Ricky Horton>curved cuts on the wire, right? Yeah. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28588-0
05:20:56.317 --> 05:21:00.817
<v Ricky Horton>Certainly looked at this, it's been,
I've been working on it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28588-1
05:21:00.817 --> 05:21:06.552
<v Ricky Horton>I just haven't got to the point of the
import side that we spend trying to get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28588-2
05:21:06.552 --> 05:21:10.980
<v Ricky Horton>our because Revit,
Revit's it's a different thought approach</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28588-3
05:21:10.980 --> 05:21:15.917
<v Ricky Horton>on how you build your assemblies and it's
their family approach so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28612-0
05:21:16.037 --> 05:21:23.784
<v Ricky Horton>It's you have to kind of have everything
complete set up beforehand and it's not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28612-1
05:21:23.784 --> 05:21:28.567
<v Ricky Horton>as to me.
It's definitely useful in a in a prefab</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28612-2
05:21:28.567 --> 05:21:31.437
<v Ricky Horton>application as in a tech, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28616-0
05:21:31.877 --> 05:21:38.917
<v Ricky Horton>It's the industry standard for doing
mechanical design.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28643-0
05:21:40.997 --> 05:21:47.668
<v Ricky Horton>And then all the other softwares that
I've researched on how other flexible</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28643-1
05:21:47.668 --> 05:21:52.057
<v Ricky Horton>jobs do it. Yeah,
and they're bringing the Revit,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28643-2
05:21:52.057 --> 05:21:56.797
<v Ricky Horton>but then it's very,
it's very cumbersome compared to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28676-0
05:21:57.477 --> 05:22:03.903
<v Ricky Horton>Like one stop stop, the tech,
like they're still doing their RFQ's and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28676-1
05:22:03.903 --> 05:22:09.605
<v Ricky Horton>combining in a separate ERP.
They're still not leveraging them</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28676-2
05:22:09.605 --> 05:22:11.597
<v Ricky Horton>estimating like we're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28712-0
05:22:12.677 --> 05:22:17.595
<v Ricky Horton>I would spend all we're doing is the
trial of the what we've got and there's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28712-1
05:22:17.595 --> 05:22:22.578
<v Ricky Horton>something there out there that's built
for the from what you're saying that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28712-2
05:22:22.578 --> 05:22:25.580
<v Ricky Horton>sounds too great.
There's there's the program,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28712-3
05:22:25.580 --> 05:22:29.477
<v Ricky Horton>there's one other software out there that
that you actually.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28760-0
05:22:30.917 --> 05:22:36.033
<v Ricky Horton>I would say combine better, yeah.
And it's only really useful though when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28760-1
05:22:36.033 --> 05:22:41.496
<v Ricky Horton>you're trying to actually recap like
things to conduits that you know and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28760-2
05:22:41.496 --> 05:22:46.474
<v Ricky Horton>also like routing an entire room to have
it more suited for that. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28760-3
05:22:46.474 --> 05:22:50.277
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not still not producing cut
lists, still not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28795-0
05:22:50.557 --> 05:22:56.675
<v Ricky Horton>Nesting and just treating it like BLM and
being able to refine like assembly to the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28795-1
05:22:56.675 --> 05:23:00.171
<v Ricky Horton>shippable. Yeah, it doesn't cover.
Like I said,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28795-2
05:23:00.171 --> 05:23:04.250
<v Ricky Horton>the purchasing doesn't cover any of the
labor tracking,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28795-3
05:23:04.250 --> 05:23:09.275
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't cover the shipping. So well,
it sounds like from what you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28795-4
05:23:09.275 --> 05:23:10.077
<v Ricky Horton>describing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28838-0
05:23:10.357 --> 05:23:16.185
<v Ricky Horton>We'll make this work and it's because
it's our prefab based that they're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28838-1
05:23:16.185 --> 05:23:22.571
<v Ricky Horton>primarily doing everything almost 100%
just trapezes and basic supports because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28838-2
05:23:22.571 --> 05:23:26.883
<v Ricky Horton>a lot of stuff we're doing is is single
conduit runs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28838-3
05:23:26.883 --> 05:23:29.757
<v Ricky Horton>It's nothing that we need to prefab.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28869-0
05:23:29.957 --> 05:23:35.441
<v Ricky Horton>I think you'll bank and get it out to the
field. Yeah, they think they're doctor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28869-1
05:23:35.441 --> 05:23:39.520
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna hear it.
It's like this means like we could easily</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28869-2
05:23:39.520 --> 05:23:45.138
<v Ricky Horton>implement and then and then the nice part
is too is that I think it's gonna give us</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28869-3
05:23:45.138 --> 05:23:46.877
<v Ricky Horton>the flexibility that like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28912-0
05:23:48.317 --> 05:23:53.234
<v Ricky Horton>Same thing would be. So if you get it,
it's just like then it gives us the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28912-1
05:23:53.234 --> 05:23:57.889
<v Ricky Horton>flexibility that we can route it to
separate shops. So like say, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28912-2
05:23:57.889 --> 05:24:01.888
<v Ricky Horton>the shops slow down,
we can route all of our shop processing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28912-3
05:24:01.888 --> 05:24:05.035
<v Ricky Horton>here and we can have largely bundle cuts.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28912-4
05:24:05.035 --> 05:24:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>they can do final assembly in that shop,
yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28938-0
05:24:08.197 --> 05:24:12.067
<v Ricky Horton>I mean because we we did all of those
healthy frames, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28938-1
05:24:12.067 --> 05:24:17.144
<v Ricky Horton>And that would have been we could have
leveraged that at the lecture shop or we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28938-2
05:24:17.144 --> 05:24:21.395
<v Ricky Horton>could have done it here,
we could have done some here, some there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28938-3
05:24:21.395 --> 05:24:23.997
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, because it's our lecture shops.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28947-0
05:24:24.437 --> 05:24:29.585
<v Ricky Horton>More,
more geared towards the higher volume</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28947-1
05:24:29.585 --> 05:24:33.797
<v Ricky Horton>stuff, but we got the bigger and so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28957-0
05:24:35.797 --> 05:24:39.917
<v Ricky Horton>So here's the spreadsheets I've been
producing so far.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28963-0
05:24:41.797 --> 05:24:47.997
<v Ricky Horton>I was 72 grand. It's starting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28969-0
05:24:52.837 --> 05:24:56.637
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think until Keith does something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28970-0
05:24:57.957 --> 05:24:58.157
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28972-0
05:25:01.437 --> 05:25:02.957
<v Ricky Horton>Mercy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28985-0
05:25:03.877 --> 05:25:07.078
<v Ricky Horton>There's really nothing, you know,
like if they ask,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/28985-1
05:25:07.078 --> 05:25:10.157
<v Ricky Horton>there's nothing you have to do on the
sequel end.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29001-0
05:25:11.637 --> 05:25:18.021
<v Ricky Horton>Or permissioning and or any of that as
long as it's true from saying on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29001-1
05:25:18.021 --> 05:25:20.037
<v Ricky Horton>address. So it's really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29022-0
05:25:20.917 --> 05:25:26.303
<v Ricky Horton>They said that's supposed to be switched
to port number and then we just pop right</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29022-1
05:25:26.303 --> 05:25:29.223
<v Ricky Horton>in. Yeah,
'cause it's all set up in the same</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29022-2
05:25:29.223 --> 05:25:33.117
<v Ricky Horton>instance as the other server. Yeah,
we're pinged into that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29027-0
05:25:57.437 --> 05:25:59.117
<v Ricky Horton>All very good teams.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29063-0
05:26:24.437 --> 05:26:30.308
<v Ricky Horton>So this would be probably one of our
higher volume type products for like a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29063-1
05:26:30.308 --> 05:26:34.558
<v Ricky Horton>data center.
So it's definitely a lot more of the same</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29063-2
05:26:34.558 --> 05:26:39.889
<v Ricky Horton>assemblies, but same concept.
I don't know why it's it would just be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29063-3
05:26:39.889 --> 05:26:41.357
<v Ricky Horton>large number of of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29069-0
05:26:41.637 --> 05:26:45.277
<v Ricky Horton>You need some of them versus by the lines
to go to the last page again.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29086-0
05:26:53.877 --> 05:27:01.153
<v Ricky Horton>And then so pretty much with the set up
for the pretab guys since you have,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29086-1
05:27:01.153 --> 05:27:02.877
<v Ricky Horton>you go to the top.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29117-0
05:27:04.357 --> 05:27:08.037
<v Ricky Horton>Assembly types and then gives you your
actual,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29117-1
05:27:08.037 --> 05:27:14.302
<v Ricky Horton>you know parameters of what dimensions
what and then those kind of or correlate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29117-2
05:27:14.302 --> 05:27:17.357
<v Ricky Horton>down to this chart charts based off of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29127-0
05:27:19.877 --> 05:27:24.357
<v Ricky Horton>So that first one,
so the charts based off of your tier one</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29127-1
05:27:24.357 --> 05:27:26.597
<v Ricky Horton>tracks and then respond label.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29156-0
05:27:28.477 --> 05:27:32.029
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
your lane was gonna be your strut length.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29156-1
05:27:32.029 --> 05:27:36.740
<v Ricky Horton>It's up there. Yep.
And then 5 inch or 5/8 so I can fix that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29156-2
05:27:36.740 --> 05:27:41.837
<v Ricky Horton>down to like the key 1000 and I can, yeah,
change those and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29215-0
05:27:43.437 --> 05:27:47.177
<v Ricky Horton>Broadway, broad side.
So they're all the parameters are in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29215-1
05:27:47.177 --> 05:27:50.347
<v Ricky Horton>there. Yeah.
And we build this however we need to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29215-2
05:27:50.347 --> 05:27:53.707
<v Ricky Horton>organize it.
And then I can also relabel everything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29215-3
05:27:53.707 --> 05:27:57.955
<v Ricky Horton>And all I have to really do is when we
kick off a job to say, hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29215-4
05:27:57.955 --> 05:28:02.837
<v Ricky Horton>these are the this is how we need family
to look and yeah, we establish all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29240-0
05:28:02.917 --> 05:28:11.522
<v Ricky Horton>Of our actuals of sizes where kind of
like our detailed standards of it needs</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29240-1
05:28:11.522 --> 05:28:20.237
<v Ricky Horton>to say P1000 Tab of team, you know,
kind of thing. So the solutions, yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29269-0
05:28:21.677 --> 05:28:28.436
<v Ricky Horton>Scroll back up to the.
So that's what's what's described in me,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29269-1
05:28:28.436 --> 05:28:33.716
<v Ricky Horton>right?
So the T1 EC 100000 is the whole assembly,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29269-2
05:28:33.716 --> 05:28:36.357
<v Ricky Horton>is that correct? Correct.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29303-0
05:28:38.037 --> 05:28:43.551
<v Ricky Horton>OK. When you you were to don't need to,
but if you were to the plan view and look</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29303-1
05:28:43.551 --> 05:28:48.460
<v Ricky Horton>at where those are labeled out,
you'll see that that label call out, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29303-2
05:28:48.460 --> 05:28:53.437
<v Ricky Horton>So that means that are assembly. OK.
And then the components within that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29319-0
05:28:54.037 --> 05:29:01.268
<v Ricky Horton>Or it makes me the rod side of the path
in the tree, I'm assuming. So OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29319-1
05:29:01.268 --> 05:29:02.637
<v Ricky Horton>I see RR1RF30.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29325-0
05:29:04.957 --> 05:29:07.357
<v Ricky Horton>So that's if that's it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29371-0
05:29:08.437 --> 05:29:12.452
<v Ricky Horton>I tried to build this.
There is some instances where you would</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29371-1
05:29:12.452 --> 05:29:15.321
<v Ricky Horton>have 3 supporters on one shuttling.
So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29371-2
05:29:15.321 --> 05:29:20.675
<v Ricky Horton>you don't actually see anything on these.
We're just trying to sign for worst case,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29371-3
05:29:20.675 --> 05:29:24.372
<v Ricky Horton>but this one really only has R1 and R2 OK
position. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29371-4
05:29:24.372 --> 05:29:26.157
<v Ricky Horton>have any that that actually.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29389-0
05:29:26.517 --> 05:29:34.036
<v Ricky Horton>Did move in different and yeah,
I need to adjust it like my zeros are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29389-1
05:29:34.036 --> 05:29:41.877
<v Ricky Horton>technically actually like a standard one
inch. So basically we would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29412-0
05:29:44.117 --> 05:29:47.234
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
you're talking about the like on on that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29412-1
05:29:47.234 --> 05:29:52.672
<v Ricky Horton>one, you're talking about four assemblies.
So you've got 8 rods that are two foot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29412-2
05:29:52.672 --> 05:29:56.917
<v Ricky Horton>long, correct? The ones that are,
the ones that are two, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29419-0
05:29:58.077 --> 05:30:02.237
<v Ricky Horton>So to get that in the tech one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29420-0
05:30:04.717 --> 05:30:04.877
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29449-0
05:30:06.477 --> 05:30:14.953
<v Ricky Horton>So required fields are quantity,
drawing number, main mark, piece mark,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29449-1
05:30:14.953 --> 05:30:21.192
<v Ricky Horton>description, grade, length.
So that needed assembly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29449-2
05:30:21.192 --> 05:30:25.077
<v Ricky Horton>I'm thinking we're going to do a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29450-0
05:30:25.197 --> 05:30:25.757
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29478-0
05:30:28.917 --> 05:30:35.266
<v Ricky Horton>A label. So the strut,
it's instruct type 158 single.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29478-1
05:30:35.266 --> 05:30:41.968
<v Ricky Horton>Is that bought as is? Is that cut?
Is that what is that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29478-2
05:30:41.968 --> 05:30:44.437
<v Ricky Horton>That's got to be cut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29507-0
05:30:44.477 --> 05:30:51.178
<v Ricky Horton>That's one in 5/8, about 1 foot six. OK,
OK, so I mean, with the tech,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29507-1
05:30:51.178 --> 05:30:57.123
<v Ricky Horton>with the technical terminology,
I'm thinking about the Stratus</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29507-2
05:30:57.123 --> 05:30:58.917
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29537-0
05:31:00.397 --> 05:31:04.166
<v Ricky Horton>And then you've got an R1 and an R2 as
parts,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29537-1
05:31:04.166 --> 05:31:10.312
<v Ricky Horton>but it can't be called R1 and R2 because
all of those are different links.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29537-2
05:31:10.312 --> 05:31:15.557
<v Ricky Horton>All those are the ones that are user
different links. Yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29562-0
05:31:17.717 --> 05:31:32.037
<v Ricky Horton>Would be R100R1R200 with your labels
000R1 and then R1001. Yeah, R1002.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29604-0
05:31:32.557 --> 05:31:36.221
<v Ricky Horton>And then if any are the same same length
of R1 and R2,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29604-1
05:31:36.221 --> 05:31:39.352
<v Ricky Horton>I guess you can technically interchange
those,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29604-2
05:31:39.352 --> 05:31:44.748
<v Ricky Horton>but to keep them in the assembly format,
probably easier to keep them named per.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29604-3
05:31:44.748 --> 05:31:48.145
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so,
but technically it's what we have in our</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29604-4
05:31:48.145 --> 05:31:50.477
<v Ricky Horton>database, our regular fab database.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29642-0
05:31:51.117 --> 05:31:56.384
<v Ricky Horton>With the P1 thousands and this having raw,
I would think they'd be able to run this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29642-1
05:31:56.384 --> 05:32:00.586
<v Ricky Horton>will be half in here. Yeah,
because that's why they're shifting by</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29642-2
05:32:00.586 --> 05:32:03.533
<v Ricky Horton>hours.
I can't because I have to create unique</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29642-3
05:32:03.533 --> 05:32:07.233
<v Ricky Horton>assemblies that are,
they call them families, right? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29642-4
05:32:07.233 --> 05:32:08.237
<v Ricky Horton>a family for it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29666-0
05:32:08.477 --> 05:32:14.773
<v Ricky Horton>I can't really try to do a way that I can
go through and combine all like links.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29666-1
05:32:14.773 --> 05:32:20.448
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, to call it a new, right?
So if if there's a way within our nesting</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29666-2
05:32:20.448 --> 05:32:20.837
<v Ricky Horton>zone.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29709-0
05:32:22.437 --> 05:32:27.312
<v Ricky Horton>But we can if we could combine like links
together, even though they'd be unique.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29709-1
05:32:27.312 --> 05:32:29.810
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we could still leverage with like a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29709-2
05:32:29.810 --> 05:32:34.804
<v Ricky Horton>bundle cut. Yeah, and yeah, I mean that.
And then as the guys bundle cut, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29709-3
05:32:34.804 --> 05:32:37.718
<v Ricky Horton>whatever quantities that we show of two
footers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29709-4
05:32:37.718 --> 05:32:40.037
<v Ricky Horton>they would just go in and just say, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29745-0
05:32:40.917 --> 05:32:44.600
<v Ricky Horton>I would just put all my 2 foot lengths in
a pile. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29745-1
05:32:44.600 --> 05:32:49.401
<v Ricky Horton>And then as the assemblers come and say,
OK, I need to make a T1 EC one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29745-2
05:32:49.401 --> 05:32:54.860
<v Ricky Horton>then you just go to the two foot bin and
pull out their R102 and reassembly. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29745-3
05:32:54.860 --> 05:32:57.557
<v Ricky Horton>because what I'm trying to get away from.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29746-0
05:32:57.797 --> 05:32:58.437
<v Ricky Horton>Is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29791-0
05:32:59.917 --> 05:33:04.931
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to utilize our columns on our
stick out because we have a a min Max to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29791-1
05:33:04.931 --> 05:33:08.050
<v Ricky Horton>be able to round up all of our family
links. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29791-2
05:33:08.050 --> 05:33:10.801
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to get to like 4 inch
increments,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29791-3
05:33:10.801 --> 05:33:15.877
<v Ricky Horton>but I think we're only gonna be able to
get to the one inch just so that matching.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29827-0
05:33:16.677 --> 05:33:19.696
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
shop guys with fraction marks and yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29827-1
05:33:19.696 --> 05:33:23.803
<v Ricky Horton>and attritions with fractions. It's yeah,
so yeah, so I get it. Um,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29827-2
05:33:23.803 --> 05:33:28.030
<v Ricky Horton>so that's a running function that we'll
do in the BLM when we export.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29827-3
05:33:28.030 --> 05:33:32.077
<v Ricky Horton>So we shouldn't technically have to to
deal with any of that, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29838-0
05:33:33.277 --> 05:33:37.167
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, is all the same material.
Is the material type like obstruct the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29838-1
05:33:37.167 --> 05:33:38.557
<v Ricky Horton>same material type items?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29888-0
05:33:39.557 --> 05:33:42.989
<v Ricky Horton>Not always,
but you're gonna have releases are gonna</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29888-1
05:33:42.989 --> 05:33:47.845
<v Ricky Horton>be typically done in by by area.
So like classified areas are gonna all be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29888-2
05:33:47.845 --> 05:33:51.213
<v Ricky Horton>stainless,
stainless and then once you get into you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29888-3
05:33:51.213 --> 05:33:54.256
<v Ricky Horton>know exterior it'll be or something like
that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29888-4
05:33:54.256 --> 05:33:59.437
<v Ricky Horton>So will that need to be in this table or
is that given globally somewhere else?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29924-0
05:33:59.437 --> 05:34:02.538
<v Ricky Horton>We wouldn't.
I would assume that when I define my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29924-1
05:34:02.538 --> 05:34:05.888
<v Ricky Horton>strut type,
we would expand that out to just feed the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29924-2
05:34:05.888 --> 05:34:09.982
<v Ricky Horton>actual P1000 number. OK.
And then that would be like P1000. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29924-3
05:34:09.982 --> 05:34:13.703
<v Ricky Horton>that's three, yeah.
And then that would be defined into the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29924-4
05:34:13.703 --> 05:34:16.557
<v Ricky Horton>the grid.
So the struts are all in the strut.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29962-0
05:34:17.117 --> 05:34:21.828
<v Ricky Horton>Correct. OK. What about the rods?
Are they always the same thing or is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29962-1
05:34:21.828 --> 05:34:25.809
<v Ricky Horton>there different types of material for
them? You would have,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29962-2
05:34:25.809 --> 05:34:30.454
<v Ricky Horton>you would have different grades available
depending on. That's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29962-3
05:34:30.454 --> 05:34:34.237
<v Ricky Horton>So you know we can use rod that's in
there as the shape.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29988-0
05:34:34.397 --> 05:34:38.990
<v Ricky Horton>And then create a strut shed,
which we should already have here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29988-1
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:44.290
<v Ricky Horton>It's a carrier right here. OK, OK,
which cause we we were doing like multi</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29988-2
05:34:44.290 --> 05:34:48.247
<v Ricky Horton>trade racks,
probably over the old one in the previous.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29988-3
05:34:48.247 --> 05:34:49.237
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah right so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/29991-0
05:34:49.517 --> 05:34:51.237
<v Ricky Horton>And again, it's kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30035-0
05:34:52.237 --> 05:34:57.301
<v Ricky Horton>We were getting to different.
I had some that we were designing within</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30035-1
05:34:57.301 --> 05:35:00.368
<v Ricky Horton>Revit,
which the design of the unit of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30035-2
05:35:00.368 --> 05:35:04.648
<v Ricky Horton>Revit's very simple.
Everything architecture pieces are all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30035-3
05:35:04.648 --> 05:35:06.717
<v Ricky Horton>kind of already family, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30069-0
05:35:08.157 --> 05:35:12.779
<v Ricky Horton>But it was a pain when we needed these
guys to actually fabricate them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30069-1
05:35:12.779 --> 05:35:16.824
<v Ricky Horton>And it was kind of a they're treated as a
structure component.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30069-2
05:35:16.824 --> 05:35:20.420
<v Ricky Horton>They're designing the. Yeah, yeah.
And so we did a lot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30069-3
05:35:20.420 --> 05:35:23.117
<v Ricky Horton>That's where I think the database has got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30109-0
05:35:23.597 --> 05:35:28.252
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty messy,
but I was doing some within Revit and I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30109-1
05:35:28.252 --> 05:35:32.907
<v Ricky Horton>was doing some within. Yeah,
actually advanced steel.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30109-2
05:35:32.907 --> 05:35:39.546
<v Ricky Horton>The majority of we did those ones.
Is that the same advanced steel with this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30109-3
05:35:39.546 --> 05:35:42.477
<v Ricky Horton>actual steel? Yeah, it's a it's a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30156-0
05:35:42.557 --> 05:35:46.163
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
It doesn't align well with here. Notice,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30156-1
05:35:46.163 --> 05:35:50.258
<v Ricky Horton>like, believe it or not,
they're they're expulsion terrible. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30156-2
05:35:50.258 --> 05:35:54.843
<v Ricky Horton>What sucks is it's an Autodesk product
that doesn't work with Gabit and it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30156-3
05:35:54.843 --> 05:35:59.122
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't work with with either.
It kind of just stuck it out there and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30156-4
05:35:59.122 --> 05:36:02.117
<v Ricky Horton>said we're not doing anything with this
anymore.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30194-0
05:36:02.157 --> 05:36:04.954
<v Ricky Horton>Cheats the exactly,
but it's it's really nice.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30194-1
05:36:04.954 --> 05:36:09.775
<v Ricky Horton>It's just like within like Eco Structure
where you can build families out and do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30194-2
05:36:09.775 --> 05:36:13.941
<v Ricky Horton>the same thing within. Yeah,
so it's it set up right. It works great,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30194-3
05:36:13.941 --> 05:36:18.524
<v Ricky Horton>but they're talking about end of lifing
it and turning it into a plug in for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30194-4
05:36:18.524 --> 05:36:19.477
<v Ricky Horton>Revit. Yeah, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30200-0
05:36:20.317 --> 05:36:24.758
<v Ricky Horton>In that case,
that could possibly solve a lot of my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30200-1
05:36:24.758 --> 05:36:26.637
<v Ricky Horton>other issues. Um, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30244-0
05:36:27.757 --> 05:36:33.343
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll get one. I'll get on in here.
Maybe it would be cleaning it up so you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30244-1
05:36:33.343 --> 05:36:38.447
<v Ricky Horton>can just have one specific call out for
each. Yeah, just because we have,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30244-2
05:36:38.447 --> 05:36:42.310
<v Ricky Horton>I mean one in five days back-to-back,
one in five days,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30244-3
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:44.517
<v Ricky Horton>one in five days solid and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30263-0
05:36:44.877 --> 05:36:52.937
<v Ricky Horton>1000 and P 1000, so well, that's yeah,
that part of our actual kickoff was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30263-1
05:36:52.937 --> 05:36:55.517
<v Ricky Horton>technically they're all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30309-0
05:36:56.477 --> 05:36:59.242
<v Ricky Horton>They're all very similar in the P1
thousands,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30309-1
05:36:59.242 --> 05:37:04.053
<v Ricky Horton>but you have actual unit thread that's
different than PHD callouts and how they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30309-2
05:37:04.053 --> 05:37:08.923
<v Ricky Horton>do theirs. So different manufacturers,
they're they're somewhat interchangeable,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30309-3
05:37:08.923 --> 05:37:13.733
<v Ricky Horton>but also kind of the specs. But I can,
I can definitely that's something easy I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30309-4
05:37:13.733 --> 05:37:15.597
<v Ricky Horton>think to clean up on how we do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30353-0
05:37:15.837 --> 05:37:19.277
<v Ricky Horton>That so something really nice that I just
figured out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30353-1
05:37:19.277 --> 05:37:23.218
<v Ricky Horton>We should figure out how to get a
different fees on the drive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30353-2
05:37:23.218 --> 05:37:27.472
<v Ricky Horton>That's what my thought is.
I've got it figured out on how to what's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30353-3
05:37:27.472 --> 05:37:30.225
<v Ricky Horton>available,
what we can leverage from Revit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30353-4
05:37:30.225 --> 05:37:34.917
<v Ricky Horton>I think you just need to start from what
tech will accept and I can build.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30357-0
05:37:35.797 --> 05:37:38.157
<v Ricky Horton>Of the BUNS to accommodate, so go to um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30374-0
05:37:41.437 --> 05:37:49.186
<v Ricky Horton>On the background here to close this and
hit technical user assistance at the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30374-1
05:37:49.186 --> 05:37:53.557
<v Ricky Horton>bottom and then search for Excel
important.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30381-0
05:38:01.717 --> 05:38:04.357
<v Ricky Horton>They're being one for production control
in EDC.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30384-0
05:38:14.277 --> 05:38:14.677
<v Ricky Horton>So the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30401-0
05:38:16.317 --> 05:38:21.475
<v Ricky Horton>Not all of these fields are needed.
You tell them whatever you want to,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30401-1
05:38:21.475 --> 05:38:25.989
<v Ricky Horton>but drawing number, benchmark, piece mark,
quality shape. Yep,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30401-2
05:38:25.989 --> 05:38:27.637
<v Ricky Horton>that's what we require.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30434-0
05:38:29.837 --> 05:38:35.266
<v Ricky Horton>So if you can get it in this format,
it may be able to do it where shape and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30434-1
05:38:35.266 --> 05:38:40.554
<v Ricky Horton>dimension are in the same field.
I think there's a big core type for that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30434-2
05:38:40.554 --> 05:38:44.997
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's not split out of shape and
dimension separate, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30477-0
05:38:45.277 --> 05:38:51.357
<v Ricky Horton>But I guess you're really not defined in
shape in the spreadsheet anyway, are you?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30477-1
05:38:51.357 --> 05:38:55.605
<v Ricky Horton>So no, I mean,
those would be defined down to just, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30477-2
05:38:55.605 --> 05:38:59.268
<v Ricky Horton>the unistrutter.
So that's that's pretty much it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30477-3
05:38:59.268 --> 05:39:03.077
<v Ricky Horton>And you you can use in the fields that
you want to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30505-0
05:39:03.357 --> 05:39:08.738
<v Ricky Horton>Like if you want a category, sub category,
whatever you want to,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30505-1
05:39:08.738 --> 05:39:14.451
<v Ricky Horton>you can use these titles,
but but that so I would imagine the strut,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30505-2
05:39:14.451 --> 05:39:18.757
<v Ricky Horton>the drawing main mark piece mark would be
the same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30543-0
05:39:18.997 --> 05:39:24.586
<v Ricky Horton>And the strut would be there on where
they do 72 is and then your rods would be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30543-1
05:39:24.586 --> 05:39:30.105
<v Ricky Horton>drawing number and main mark would be the
same as the strut and the piece mark</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30543-2
05:39:30.105 --> 05:39:34.157
<v Ricky Horton>would be the R1.
You know you get bridge with it somehow.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30565-0
05:39:34.157 --> 05:39:38.224
<v Ricky Horton>Or one next year, year, year,
whatever you want to do with it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30565-1
05:39:38.224 --> 05:39:42.420
<v Ricky Horton>And then it should. I mean,
we could call a few in here and just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30565-2
05:39:42.420 --> 05:39:45.842
<v Ricky Horton>important and see what happens.
If that works, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30565-3
05:39:45.842 --> 05:39:48.037
<v Ricky Horton>you want to talk real quick, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30566-0
05:39:50.037 --> 05:39:51.077
<v Ricky Horton>Take a message.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30581-0
05:39:56.717 --> 05:40:00.501
<v Ricky Horton>If you have a an export,
you can try to import it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30581-1
05:40:00.501 --> 05:40:06.140
<v Ricky Horton>You want to just take one of the line
items off of that drawing when you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30581-2
05:40:06.140 --> 05:40:06.957
<v Ricky Horton>looking at.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30588-0
05:40:10.077 --> 05:40:14.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, like that P1HC100 or something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30594-0
05:40:21.917 --> 05:40:24.397
<v Ricky Horton>The other guy I can add was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30605-0
05:40:25.877 --> 05:40:31.090
<v Ricky Horton>Coming up with and this might be too much
work or something I was just thinking</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30605-1
05:40:31.090 --> 05:40:31.677
<v Ricky Horton>about is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30654-0
05:40:32.557 --> 05:40:37.422
<v Ricky Horton>Because I can possibly create,
let's just say within some structure I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30654-1
05:40:37.422 --> 05:40:42.913
<v Ricky Horton>could create a kiss file that would be
defined as each one of those assemblies</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30654-2
05:40:42.913 --> 05:40:48.542
<v Ricky Horton>and then create that as a body and figure
out some way of manipulating like kiss</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30654-3
05:40:48.542 --> 05:40:52.157
<v Ricky Horton>file essentially with with the links and
then just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30687-0
05:40:52.197 --> 05:40:57.774
<v Ricky Horton>Just using that as just a single import.
I wouldn't and I I wouldn't worry too</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30687-1
05:40:57.774 --> 05:41:02.575
<v Ricky Horton>much about trying to force it into a kiss
file. Really. In my mind,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30687-2
05:41:02.575 --> 05:41:07.517
<v Ricky Horton>there's some kiss file in Excel, right?
There's not. So if the Excel.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30737-0
05:41:08.397 --> 05:41:13.651
<v Ricky Horton>Makes it easier than I would just because
once I think what's nice to do is that we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30737-1
05:41:13.651 --> 05:41:18.218
<v Ricky Horton>get that situation where there'll be some
sort of a field change, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30737-2
05:41:18.218 --> 05:41:23.035
<v Ricky Horton>And then we have a like a sub blank
ordering system where the guys can spill</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30737-3
05:41:23.035 --> 05:41:27.477
<v Ricky Horton>out, you know, length, width, type,
whatever and then just send it in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30754-0
05:41:27.477 --> 05:41:31.947
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, I, you know,
Jimmy screwed up the design, so I need 30,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30754-1
05:41:31.947 --> 05:41:35.392
<v Ricky Horton>right?
And then we can just leverage that back</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30754-2
05:41:35.392 --> 05:41:38.397
<v Ricky Horton>into here, type it and then export, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30766-0
05:41:43.837 --> 05:41:52.557
<v Ricky Horton>Are you looking to do estimates for this
in here as well at this point?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30814-0
05:41:54.157 --> 05:41:57.751
<v Ricky Horton>Probably not.
So the way that the way that election was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30814-1
05:41:57.751 --> 05:42:01.025
<v Ricky Horton>estimated,
they actually have a a pretty good idea</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30814-2
05:42:01.025 --> 05:42:05.647
<v Ricky Horton>from the field side of this. Yeah.
And so technically the way that they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30814-3
05:42:05.647 --> 05:42:10.654
<v Ricky Horton>estimate is based on the Nika value and
then as if these were all done in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30814-4
05:42:10.654 --> 05:42:12.837
<v Ricky Horton>field. Yeah, because they kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30835-0
05:42:12.837 --> 05:42:16.581
<v Ricky Horton>The way they're estimating software works
is that they just put in a parameter</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30835-1
05:42:16.581 --> 05:42:20.182
<v Ricky Horton>saying we can support every six feet,
make all the condo to run and then it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30835-2
05:42:20.182 --> 05:42:21.557
<v Ricky Horton>automatically populates K um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30879-0
05:42:22.557 --> 05:42:25.382
<v Ricky Horton>So,
but in what would actually be long term,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30879-1
05:42:25.382 --> 05:42:29.525
<v Ricky Horton>what would be nice would be from a
project management standpoint,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30879-2
05:42:29.525 --> 05:42:34.673
<v Ricky Horton>we'll be able to actually to be able to
come up with realistic expectations about</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30879-3
05:42:34.673 --> 05:42:39.758
<v Ricky Horton>how much you can put through a shop. Yeah.
So you're not going to overload them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30879-4
05:42:39.758 --> 05:42:40.637
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30897-0
05:42:40.757 --> 05:42:45.604
<v Ricky Horton>And that's maybe not to maybe not to get
into all the work, but yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30897-1
05:42:45.604 --> 05:42:50.035
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not actually into the same,
but might be um uh next, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30897-2
05:42:50.035 --> 05:42:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>I think so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30928-0
05:42:58.757 --> 05:43:05.535
<v Ricky Horton>So man, that's awesome.
So you'd be looking at them to create the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30928-1
05:43:05.535 --> 05:43:12.518
<v Ricky Horton>cut of this and what not you.
I mean ideally you can do this on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30928-2
05:43:12.518 --> 05:43:13.237
<v Ricky Horton>tablet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30935-0
05:43:14.277 --> 05:43:21.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, almost 3% of the tablet.
The only problem with that would be, um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30963-0
05:43:23.797 --> 05:43:30.952
<v Ricky Horton>Talking for like one of that notions. No,
I'm talking about for licensing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30963-1
05:43:30.952 --> 05:43:38.298
<v Ricky Horton>You can only have one site for one good
site per per server. Yeah, actually,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30963-2
05:43:38.298 --> 05:43:40.397
<v Ricky Horton>but for we'll call it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30966-0
05:43:41.037 --> 05:43:44.797
<v Ricky Horton>Or database report. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30993-0
05:43:45.797 --> 05:43:53.719
<v Ricky Horton>So if you were to do them the other edge
site, they probably will separate. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/30993-1
05:43:53.719 --> 05:43:59.517
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know, separate it somewhere,
but I believe they're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31005-0
05:44:01.717 --> 05:44:05.548
<v Ricky Horton>They're on the same.
They're operating on our same servers</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31005-1
05:44:05.548 --> 05:44:07.757
<v Ricky Horton>though at the Dunn's facility, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31053-0
05:44:08.677 --> 05:44:12.772
<v Ricky Horton>Other than an IP address,
I don't think they would actually know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31053-1
05:44:12.772 --> 05:44:17.737
<v Ricky Horton>But if you want two different databases,
then currently go to your go site that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31053-2
05:44:17.737 --> 05:44:21.088
<v Ricky Horton>they're using can only point to one of
the databases.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31053-3
05:44:21.088 --> 05:44:26.114
<v Ricky Horton>They can't read from either or and the
database is just from a material database</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31053-4
05:44:26.114 --> 05:44:26.797
<v Ricky Horton>standpoint.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31084-0
05:44:27.557 --> 05:44:30.851
<v Ricky Horton>Word. Yeah,
like if we want to set or separate that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31084-1
05:44:30.851 --> 05:44:34.335
<v Ricky Horton>from all their trials, right.
You want your own thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31084-2
05:44:34.335 --> 05:44:38.389
<v Ricky Horton>Here's all my and that's gonna be a
totally different database,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31084-3
05:44:38.389 --> 05:44:42.317
<v Ricky Horton>which is what we were trying to open up
and I don't I I mean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31123-0
05:44:43.877 --> 05:44:48.808
<v Ricky Horton>I would say, I mean,
ideally we throw the same department we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31123-1
05:44:48.808 --> 05:44:52.769
<v Ricky Horton>have, you know,
their own electric coordinators,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31123-2
05:44:52.769 --> 05:44:59.075
<v Ricky Horton>but it would be just easy to to have an
electric coordinator operating in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31123-3
05:44:59.075 --> 05:45:03.117
<v Ricky Horton>same zones then or the same environment
and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31156-0
05:45:03.237 --> 05:45:06.267
<v Ricky Horton>There's no reason it it it should muddy
either,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31156-1
05:45:06.267 --> 05:45:11.256
<v Ricky Horton>or we can just send it to these guys and
then they can produce the cutlass and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31156-2
05:45:11.256 --> 05:45:15.991
<v Ricky Horton>then it just gets it gets routed to,
you know, the electrical team, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31156-3
05:45:15.991 --> 05:45:18.517
<v Ricky Horton>And then he kind of executes from there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31193-0
05:45:18.757 --> 05:45:22.228
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
because essentially we're both on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31193-1
05:45:22.228 --> 05:45:27.040
<v Ricky Horton>same server service.
That's where we're running into issues.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31193-2
05:45:27.040 --> 05:45:31.458
<v Ricky Horton>There's no reason,
especially with those sizes defined,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31193-3
05:45:31.458 --> 05:45:35.797
<v Ricky Horton>we can create electrical only jobs in
there and these.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31224-0
05:45:36.197 --> 05:45:41.771
<v Ricky Horton>To find them out from everything and and
then you can be more you can go less and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31224-1
05:45:41.771 --> 05:45:46.665
<v Ricky Horton>then you can use it over there,
access the compass the same as we would</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31224-2
05:45:46.665 --> 05:45:48.637
<v Ricky Horton>hear. Yeah, that's something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31230-0
05:45:49.557 --> 05:45:51.237
<v Ricky Horton>I could see you running with the
Everett's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31231-0
05:45:53.197 --> 05:45:53.597
<v Ricky Horton>It is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31277-0
05:45:54.917 --> 05:45:59.901
<v Ricky Horton>It is a mix like, but yeah,
it'll come with its own pickups, I'm sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31277-1
05:45:59.901 --> 05:46:05.798
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but I mean I would with our current,
with our current workflow and everything</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31277-2
05:46:05.798 --> 05:46:11.414
<v Ricky Horton>like that, I would see this would be,
I would need maybe one Douglas for and it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31277-3
05:46:11.414 --> 05:46:12.397
<v Ricky Horton>would just be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31299-0
05:46:12.797 --> 05:46:16.067
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
Mike would would just have control over</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31299-1
05:46:16.067 --> 05:46:22.038
<v Ricky Horton>it and he would just be delegating to the
dot guys as as it goes in and out kind of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31299-2
05:46:22.038 --> 05:46:24.597
<v Ricky Horton>thing. Now are you wanting to do um?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31300-0
05:46:26.197 --> 05:46:26.717
<v Ricky Horton>Line.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31334-0
05:46:29.957 --> 05:46:34.959
<v Ricky Horton>You want to track other things within the
system. So after cutting,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31334-1
05:46:34.959 --> 05:46:40.182
<v Ricky Horton>you want to track the shipping of it and
whatnot there. Ideally, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31334-2
05:46:40.182 --> 05:46:45.037
<v Ricky Horton>we we would package, you know,
because we're going to be greatly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31375-0
05:46:45.237 --> 05:46:50.018
<v Ricky Horton>We're gonna break things down into like
separate work packages. So you'll have,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31375-1
05:46:50.018 --> 05:46:52.947
<v Ricky Horton>you know this,
you only would spread out across,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31375-2
05:46:52.947 --> 05:46:57.848
<v Ricky Horton>you know, several work packages. Yeah,
and then we'll see the process from there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31375-3
05:46:57.848 --> 05:47:00.717
<v Ricky Horton>And so the guys working, you know,
in area one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31409-0
05:47:01.397 --> 05:47:04.835
<v Ricky Horton>It'll be shipped out as an area one
package, OK, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31409-1
05:47:04.835 --> 05:47:09.808
<v Ricky Horton>And then and trying to keep everything
bundled to where it directly goes to site</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31409-2
05:47:09.808 --> 05:47:14.045
<v Ricky Horton>and stage to that area. Yeah,
we don't have to shake everything out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31409-3
05:47:14.045 --> 05:47:16.317
<v Ricky Horton>It'd be using a sequence as possible.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31420-0
05:47:16.757 --> 05:47:21.597
<v Ricky Horton>The actual work packages or your exactly
and that's kinda how we're setting up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31469-0
05:47:22.757 --> 05:47:28.055
<v Ricky Horton>That's how we're kind of setting up our
claiming anyways. Yeah, that work package.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31469-1
05:47:28.055 --> 05:47:30.801
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so correlating that backwards from our</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31469-2
05:47:30.801 --> 05:47:35.844
<v Ricky Horton>our take off because we're actually just
similar like what you're doing within</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31469-3
05:47:35.844 --> 05:47:40.951
<v Ricky Horton>structures and far as like the once it
goes and gets claimed and kind of builds</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31469-4
05:47:40.951 --> 05:47:42.037
<v Ricky Horton>the model, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-0
05:47:42.037 --> 05:47:45.075
<v Ricky Horton>So we're using that same,
they call it asset tracking,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-1
05:47:45.075 --> 05:47:48.886
<v Ricky Horton>but it's the same concept within of it
and it wouldn't be that hard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-2
05:47:48.886 --> 05:47:53.140
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the work package is created.
It automatically creates a BUM based on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-3
05:47:53.140 --> 05:47:56.564
<v Ricky Horton>this. Yeah, we bring,
we could bring them in as separate lots</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-4
05:47:56.564 --> 05:48:00.818
<v Ricky Horton>and we can combine across lots. Yeah.
And then still get the efficiency out,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31521-5
05:48:00.818 --> 05:48:01.757
<v Ricky Horton>so we'll be able.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31523-0
05:48:02.077 --> 05:48:02.557
<v Ricky Horton>Track it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31525-0
05:48:03.757 --> 05:48:04.397
<v Ricky Horton>Separately.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31538-0
05:48:09.197 --> 05:48:15.037
<v Ricky Horton>So do you strike come in like, uh,
like what? What license is it going to?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31575-0
05:48:16.877 --> 05:48:22.018
<v Ricky Horton>Twelves, 20s. OK, I think, yeah, 10s, 12s,
20s, I think. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31575-1
05:48:22.018 --> 05:48:27.975
<v Ricky Horton>I keep 20s probably are more typical than
I've been getting in. However,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31575-2
05:48:27.975 --> 05:48:32.382
<v Ricky Horton>past the stretch shortage,
that'll be better to find.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31575-3
05:48:32.382 --> 05:48:35.157
<v Ricky Horton>So we got to set that up with the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31582-0
05:48:35.157 --> 05:48:38.487
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
price and maintenance in order to get the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31582-1
05:48:38.487 --> 05:48:39.597
<v Ricky Horton>lights in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31589-0
05:48:43.117 --> 05:48:47.867
<v Ricky Horton>Do you know who's adding the maintenance
if that's what we have with order? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31589-1
05:48:47.867 --> 05:48:48.157
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31598-0
05:48:56.437 --> 05:49:00.077
<v Ricky Horton>That's great. That's not in there, right?
Or is that great news?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31620-0
05:49:04.837 --> 05:49:09.956
<v Ricky Horton>But we've got a number of grades in there.
You can get add down with Bob and bring</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31620-1
05:49:09.956 --> 05:49:11.437
<v Ricky Horton>all the other grades in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31629-0
05:49:13.957 --> 05:49:19.077
<v Ricky Horton>If you leave that blank,
we'll bring in all great set of stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31634-0
05:49:42.677 --> 05:49:45.597
<v Ricky Horton>It's always good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31643-0
05:49:47.397 --> 05:49:52.397
<v Ricky Horton>If that, which we have something for the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31650-0
05:50:02.157 --> 05:50:03.637
<v Ricky Horton>This I think will work very well with
that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31680-0
05:50:07.677 --> 05:50:15.248
<v Ricky Horton>And then so essentially if ideally when
we redesign our our families, we can,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31680-1
05:50:15.248 --> 05:50:23.014
<v Ricky Horton>I can further expand these to where we
need to get to fittings where we can get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31680-2
05:50:23.014 --> 05:50:23.597
<v Ricky Horton>it to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31684-0
05:50:24.237 --> 05:50:26.477
<v Ricky Horton>Washington minutes, yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31692-0
05:50:31.517 --> 05:50:35.477
<v Ricky Horton>That's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31695-0
05:50:40.437 --> 05:50:42.837
<v Ricky Horton>What the I don't love and ready?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31710-0
05:52:11.717 --> 05:52:21.237
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but it's a 40 foot piece of what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31719-0
05:52:24.517 --> 05:52:27.729
<v Ricky Horton>Be able to get it.
You still want to pull it out the truck,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31719-1
05:52:27.729 --> 05:52:27.997
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31726-0
05:52:35.757 --> 05:52:37.357
<v Ricky Horton>For sure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31727-0
05:52:40.717 --> 05:52:41.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31737-0
05:52:41.797 --> 05:52:45.877
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you. That's what you want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31740-0
05:53:05.317 --> 05:53:06.957
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31741-0
05:53:11.837 --> 05:53:11.997
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31743-0
05:53:14.877 --> 05:53:15.077
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31767-0
05:53:16.477 --> 05:53:22.375
<v Ricky Horton>So can can you you you said you can
modify ribs and you'll kick it out in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31767-1
05:53:22.375 --> 05:53:27.157
<v Ricky Horton>this format. Yeah,
the only thing I'm not 100% sure is how.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31770-0
05:53:28.797 --> 05:53:31.037
<v Ricky Horton>They're not gonna be electronic numbers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31803-0
05:53:32.197 --> 05:53:36.955
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and I, but at the end of my opinion,
worst worst case,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31803-1
05:53:36.955 --> 05:53:42.962
<v Ricky Horton>I think I come up with a a way to massage
the data from from revenue export.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31803-2
05:53:42.962 --> 05:53:47.486
<v Ricky Horton>We can just do some pretty basic itself
up and then yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31803-3
05:53:47.486 --> 05:53:49.437
<v Ricky Horton>get it into this one app.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31822-0
05:53:49.717 --> 05:53:54.199
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'm wondering if it's one of those deals</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31822-1
05:53:54.199 --> 05:53:58.872
<v Ricky Horton>where you can, you know, you know,
R1 comes out,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31822-2
05:53:58.872 --> 05:54:04.117
<v Ricky Horton>append those last little digits of the
drawing number.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31824-0
05:54:05.557 --> 05:54:06.117
<v Ricky Horton>But it's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31830-0
05:54:08.597 --> 05:54:10.717
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's that problem there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31839-0
05:54:12.037 --> 05:54:18.197
<v Ricky Horton>The easiest of, yeah, but yeah,
it's really flexible.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31841-0
05:54:19.837 --> 05:54:21.077
<v Ricky Horton>And what you want?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31855-0
05:54:23.877 --> 05:54:26.498
<v Ricky Horton>Great.
How's that going to get to find the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31855-1
05:54:26.498 --> 05:54:28.997
<v Ricky Horton>because that that wasn't working without.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31890-0
05:54:29.957 --> 05:54:37.399
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, on the the grade will differentiate,
so it'll be a stainless,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31890-1
05:54:37.399 --> 05:54:45.717
<v Ricky Horton>a hot dip as any gold and so I'm not sure
there's some duplicates in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31904-0
05:54:46.237 --> 05:54:49.598
<v Ricky Horton>But honestly,
ideally you don't want to have to touch</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31904-1
05:54:49.598 --> 05:54:53.770
<v Ricky Horton>it when it comes out. Yeah,
and I don't know how feasible that is,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31904-2
05:54:53.770 --> 05:54:54.517
<v Ricky Horton>but you can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31908-0
05:54:55.917 --> 05:54:57.957
<v Ricky Horton>Somehow if I agree.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31934-0
05:54:59.317 --> 05:55:04.278
<v Ricky Horton>Which we can have to do that sort of
global edit to. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31934-1
05:55:04.278 --> 05:55:11.173
<v Ricky Horton>but that's it's honestly that seemed like
a parameter we should be able to easily</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31934-2
05:55:11.173 --> 05:55:14.957
<v Ricky Horton>set up. Yeah, OK, cool.
See if I can get in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31969-0
05:55:30.837 --> 05:55:36.821
<v Ricky Horton>It's really the only thing you need to
try is the cutting of it and should be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31969-1
05:55:36.821 --> 05:55:41.731
<v Ricky Horton>done pretty much right. Well,
I would say yeah, the purchasing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31969-2
05:55:41.731 --> 05:55:44.877
<v Ricky Horton>purchasing receipt and then yes, cutting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31993-0
05:55:46.277 --> 05:55:50.209
<v Ricky Horton>Cutting.
I know we probably have the same sort of,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31993-1
05:55:50.209 --> 05:55:54.295
<v Ricky Horton>you know, QC. Yeah,
we don't have any codings on it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31993-2
05:55:54.295 --> 05:55:58.844
<v Ricky Horton>And then you know,
shipping and then the BOM and receiving</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/31993-3
05:55:58.844 --> 05:56:01.157
<v Ricky Horton>field capacity for assemblies.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32024-0
05:56:01.797 --> 05:56:07.979
<v Ricky Horton>Made here or there in the field.
The assemblies would be made at here at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32024-1
05:56:07.979 --> 05:56:12.467
<v Ricky Horton>the shop.
So who orders to put the rusting parts in?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32024-2
05:56:12.467 --> 05:56:19.157
<v Ricky Horton>Like I saw you have bean clamps for that.
So the the beam clamps are probably.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32029-0
05:56:19.277 --> 05:56:21.637
<v Ricky Horton>Just take this further down. Um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32071-0
05:56:22.477 --> 05:56:27.629
<v Ricky Horton>The way that they do their ordering is
they just do a a bulk order essentially</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32071-1
05:56:27.629 --> 05:56:31.543
<v Ricky Horton>at the beginning,
but then the vendor does a a min Max kind</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32071-2
05:56:31.543 --> 05:56:34.348
<v Ricky Horton>of thing.
So I would just say as the Azure</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32071-3
05:56:34.348 --> 05:56:36.957
<v Ricky Horton>assembler is is pulling all their stuff.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32102-0
05:56:38.437 --> 05:56:41.819
<v Ricky Horton>They just know that they're gearing up
for this assembly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32102-1
05:56:41.819 --> 05:56:46.075
<v Ricky Horton>So they're gonna go pull, you know,
I know I need 100 of these and we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32102-2
05:56:46.075 --> 05:56:49.923
<v Ricky Horton>gonna pull 400 nuts kind of thing based
off of what what that is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32102-3
05:56:49.923 --> 05:56:53.597
<v Ricky Horton>So I think we could leverage it further.
I just don't know if.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32108-0
05:56:53.797 --> 05:56:58.237
<v Ricky Horton>If that might be taking a little too too
badly on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32141-0
05:57:01.077 --> 05:57:09.389
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want the do you want them to track
how many have been assembled and how many</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32141-1
05:57:09.389 --> 05:57:14.238
<v Ricky Horton>have not?
Or just I'm really just tracking Caddy</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32141-2
05:57:14.238 --> 05:57:16.317
<v Ricky Horton>with UC and shipping.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32171-0
05:57:16.997 --> 05:57:20.134
<v Ricky Horton>Because we're gonna be breaking the work
packages,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32171-1
05:57:20.134 --> 05:57:24.809
<v Ricky Horton>I think we would want to be tracking
total quantities of being done because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32171-2
05:57:24.809 --> 05:57:29.053
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna spread across.
So you you would want to be able to track</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32171-3
05:57:29.053 --> 05:57:30.837
<v Ricky Horton>completion based off of your.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32174-0
05:57:31.997 --> 05:57:34.077
<v Ricky Horton>So probably your way out to the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32211-0
05:57:35.877 --> 05:57:38.884
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
a lot more simple cutting around some</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32211-1
05:57:38.884 --> 05:57:42.370
<v Ricky Horton>work, yeah.
And then if we wanted to track the the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32211-2
05:57:42.370 --> 05:57:46.129
<v Ricky Horton>completion of the assembly,
if they have a QC portion,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32211-3
05:57:46.129 --> 05:57:51.597
<v Ricky Horton>we can always find a station in there for
assembly and then have an inspection.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32239-0
05:57:51.957 --> 05:57:57.536
<v Ricky Horton>And then when we fill out the inspection
report for this is going to be the job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32239-1
05:57:57.536 --> 05:58:00.498
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they're just doing they're doing the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32239-2
05:58:00.498 --> 05:58:05.250
<v Ricky Horton>first article inspection and then like
every 10 or so kind of thing,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32239-3
05:58:05.250 --> 05:58:07.317
<v Ricky Horton>but but I think they globally.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32267-0
05:58:07.397 --> 05:58:12.763
<v Ricky Horton>Go through that because yeah,
then we would just end up creating a blog</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32267-1
05:58:12.763 --> 05:58:18.875
<v Ricky Horton>like we did for for codings because then
they could go in and piece tracking gear</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32267-2
05:58:18.875 --> 05:58:22.677
<v Ricky Horton>and just manually have completed and move
batches.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32269-0
05:58:23.197 --> 05:58:23.997
<v Ricky Horton>Definitely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32288-0
05:58:26.277 --> 05:58:34.350
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's that's let's see, let me see.
So the issue is, yeah, like I said,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32288-1
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:40.277
<v Ricky Horton>the switch is probably getting it in
there in the format.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32300-0
05:58:47.557 --> 05:58:54.357
<v Ricky Horton>So can we can we create a a route that
will just say like?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32354-0
05:58:55.597 --> 05:59:00.062
<v Ricky Horton>But we just call it electrical assembly
or you just need to fall in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32354-1
05:59:00.062 --> 05:59:05.005
<v Ricky Horton>I mean create a route and you can put so
much from so or would that be where where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32354-2
05:59:05.005 --> 05:59:09.947
<v Ricky Horton>you just what do you make more sense that
kind of bringing in one of the something</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32354-3
05:59:09.947 --> 05:59:13.162
<v Ricky Horton>fabrication.
I mean I mean if you could learn to spit</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32354-4
05:59:13.162 --> 05:59:13.877
<v Ricky Horton>up and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32381-0
05:59:13.957 --> 05:59:21.897
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we have.
These are all our routes that we have in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32381-1
05:59:21.897 --> 05:59:28.419
<v Ricky Horton>here. So,
so we can just tailor one of these,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32381-2
05:59:28.419 --> 05:59:32.957
<v Ricky Horton>create a new one for electrical.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32383-0
05:59:33.517 --> 05:59:35.117
<v Ricky Horton>I mean here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32417-0
05:59:52.557 --> 05:59:59.627
<v Ricky Horton>Does the costing have to roll up any
specific way or can it just roll up under</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32417-1
05:59:59.627 --> 06:00:04.282
<v Ricky Horton>company 40 through 700 here at this stage
we would.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32417-2
06:00:04.282 --> 06:00:08.757
<v Ricky Horton>So I think we would treat this the same
way that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32450-0
06:00:09.077 --> 06:00:14.452
<v Ricky Horton>We're kind of doing now is that we we
would actually do combining and that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32450-1
06:00:14.452 --> 06:00:20.258
<v Ricky Horton>would to the electrical procurement and
then they would just tell us the PO that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32450-2
06:00:20.258 --> 06:00:24.917
<v Ricky Horton>they cut for that and then it would be
added in the system here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32482-0
06:00:27.357 --> 06:00:33.105
<v Ricky Horton>Because I don't know at least the way
currently set up is is they have I mean</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32482-1
06:00:33.105 --> 06:00:38.706
<v Ricky Horton>because it's still it's it's all under 40
but it's still it's two different</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32482-2
06:00:38.706 --> 06:00:40.917
<v Ricky Horton>divisions so they just get it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32508-0
06:00:41.557 --> 06:00:46.170
<v Ricky Horton>Keeping Mark in his procurement strategy
would probably be the easiest,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32508-1
06:00:46.170 --> 06:00:48.990
<v Ricky Horton>but then all he has to do is just say,
hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32508-2
06:00:48.990 --> 06:00:54.180
<v Ricky Horton>here's the PO number and inspect the date
and I think just bring it back in that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32508-3
06:00:54.180 --> 06:00:54.437
<v Ricky Horton>way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32512-0
06:00:55.797 --> 06:00:59.757
<v Ricky Horton>But ideally we could get it to where I
see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32514-0
06:01:00.757 --> 06:01:01.517
<v Ricky Horton>One of us.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32529-0
06:01:04.117 --> 06:01:07.188
<v Ricky Horton>Unless they have like a coordinator in
here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32529-1
06:01:07.188 --> 06:01:10.397
<v Ricky Horton>not the new doing where to purchase from,
but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32534-0
06:01:11.477 --> 06:01:14.477
<v Ricky Horton>I want to see that this is not the other.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32537-0
06:01:20.477 --> 06:01:24.797
<v Ricky Horton>Basically, it cuts on some of the week.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32571-0
06:01:26.597 --> 06:01:32.342
<v Ricky Horton>What we need,
even if we go where we have that QC one</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32571-1
06:01:32.342 --> 06:01:37.555
<v Ricky Horton>as well, we can add a QC one,
but if we want to,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32571-2
06:01:37.555 --> 06:01:41.917
<v Ricky Horton>so our fit up triggers the QC inspection.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32613-0
06:01:42.357 --> 06:01:46.579
<v Ricky Horton>Just cause that's tied to it,
but the assembly portion we can tie a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32613-1
06:01:46.579 --> 06:01:51.298
<v Ricky Horton>case of inspection to that as well.
The only problem is going to be I guess</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32613-2
06:01:51.298 --> 06:01:55.085
<v Ricky Horton>you can can do that,
but if you haven't typed an inspection,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32613-3
06:01:55.085 --> 06:01:58.997
<v Ricky Horton>you can still mark it off the piece
tracking if they're doing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32634-0
06:01:58.997 --> 06:02:05.221
<v Ricky Horton>All one every 10,
so anything that's in the route here that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32634-1
06:02:05.221 --> 06:02:09.785
<v Ricky Horton>expects you to be on another set of
pieces.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32634-2
06:02:09.785 --> 06:02:14.557
<v Ricky Horton>So then you see what you know 10% of it
then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32682-0
06:02:14.917 --> 06:02:18.500
<v Ricky Horton>Expects it a little in the future, right?
I mean, he can. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32682-1
06:02:18.500 --> 06:02:21.811
<v Ricky Horton>he can go through and and check off at 10
we're done, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32682-2
06:02:21.811 --> 06:02:25.502
<v Ricky Horton>And then just do the physical inspection
on the the 10th one. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32682-3
06:02:25.502 --> 06:02:28.434
<v Ricky Horton>And or you know,
you can do it this way just like the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32682-4
06:02:28.434 --> 06:02:30.117
<v Ricky Horton>whole batch has been assembled.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32714-0
06:02:30.157 --> 06:02:35.752
<v Ricky Horton>And there is QC testing like a whole type
thing you can fill out that you can still</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32714-1
06:02:35.752 --> 06:02:40.614
<v Ricky Horton>just fill out for the 10% of it.
So you have those records that you know</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32714-2
06:02:40.614 --> 06:02:44.877
<v Ricky Horton>that the whole block is done.
So where's packaging and loading?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32722-0
06:02:45.237 --> 06:02:49.415
<v Ricky Horton>That would be the next thing is there's
way more packaging on the list of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32722-1
06:02:49.415 --> 06:02:50.037
<v Ricky Horton>quantities.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32724-0
06:03:02.357 --> 06:03:02.957
<v Ricky Horton>Search.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32743-0
06:03:04.677 --> 06:03:09.390
<v Ricky Horton>And that's like we take them stock,
cut them when they cut out the cut list</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32743-1
06:03:09.390 --> 06:03:14.165
<v Ricky Horton>to take the stock and get marked out.
So those first two categories will get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32743-2
06:03:14.165 --> 06:03:17.080
<v Ricky Horton>down.
That's the cut of the skate cut and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32743-3
06:03:17.080 --> 06:03:19.437
<v Ricky Horton>the assembly portion will be striving.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32776-0
06:03:19.797 --> 06:03:24.296
<v Ricky Horton>And I completed because there's a huge
volume here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32776-1
06:03:24.296 --> 06:03:30.527
<v Ricky Horton>Are you guys going to make packaging that
makes it easier to move them?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32776-2
06:03:30.527 --> 06:03:37.277
<v Ricky Horton>They have for for the local stuff,
we have carts that we ship back and forth.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32811-0
06:03:37.717 --> 06:03:43.087
<v Ricky Horton>And so they're ideally you would load up
a cart and then that cart would have all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32811-1
06:03:43.087 --> 06:03:46.033
<v Ricky Horton>the the same traps and then whatever
needed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32811-2
06:03:46.033 --> 06:03:51.338
<v Ricky Horton>And then then that would be correlated
with that work package and you go to that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32811-3
06:03:51.338 --> 06:03:52.517
<v Ricky Horton>one, that one. So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32827-0
06:03:52.917 --> 06:03:55.994
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they need those parts here too,
just to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32827-1
06:03:55.994 --> 06:04:00.905
<v Ricky Horton>But I imagine those go to the field.
The field has whatever. Mm-hmm. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32827-2
06:04:00.905 --> 06:04:01.757
<v Ricky Horton>so they look.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32850-0
06:04:12.557 --> 06:04:17.320
<v Ricky Horton>Tech will need to know the road belt.
I don't know how many of these parts</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32850-1
06:04:17.320 --> 06:04:20.496
<v Ricky Horton>should be,
but let's say I mean this looks like a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32850-2
06:04:20.496 --> 06:04:21.957
<v Ricky Horton>huge quantity would be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32864-0
06:04:23.397 --> 06:04:29.366
<v Ricky Horton>No, but I mean,
is it like 3 carts on a job or is it like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32864-1
06:04:29.366 --> 06:04:33.277
<v Ricky Horton>50 carts on a job we probably have on?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32908-0
06:04:35.397 --> 06:04:40.782
<v Ricky Horton>We'll probably have 20 to 30 in rotation
and then total is ideally we try to break</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32908-1
06:04:40.782 --> 06:04:43.701
<v Ricky Horton>everything into like one week work
packages.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32908-2
06:04:43.701 --> 06:04:48.632
<v Ricky Horton>So if we're a week ahead of that,
a week's in the field and a week's coming</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32908-3
06:04:48.632 --> 06:04:52.006
<v Ricky Horton>back, yeah,
I mean that always really gives you 10,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32908-4
06:04:52.006 --> 06:04:54.277
<v Ricky Horton>you know, in the field at the time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32915-0
06:04:54.677 --> 06:04:58.597
<v Ricky Horton>That's here locally, correct?
What happens if they go to Ohio?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32959-0
06:04:59.317 --> 06:05:03.066
<v Ricky Horton>That's Iowa's problem. OK,
now in the past what we've done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32959-1
06:05:03.066 --> 06:05:07.253
<v Ricky Horton>So between Iowa and Texas,
they have their own fab shops there and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32959-2
06:05:07.253 --> 06:05:11.002
<v Ricky Horton>so that's their own rotation.
So we don't worry about that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/32959-3
06:05:11.002 --> 06:05:14.877
<v Ricky Horton>We started doing prefab for Dallas here
until they got there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33007-0
06:05:14.997 --> 06:05:19.610
<v Ricky Horton>Their prefab shop up and running and then
now 'cause that's what we what we did on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33007-1
06:05:19.610 --> 06:05:23.779
<v Ricky Horton>that line is we prefab carts and we did
the first shipment while they were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33007-2
06:05:23.779 --> 06:05:28.337
<v Ricky Horton>getting started and then that was their
first set of carts they used to ship out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33007-3
06:05:28.337 --> 06:05:32.117
<v Ricky Horton>But I think the firmest one that we're
gonna have to figure out is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33040-0
06:05:32.397 --> 06:05:35.745
<v Ricky Horton>New Mexico,
it's probably the next one where we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33040-1
06:05:35.745 --> 06:05:40.734
<v Ricky Horton>going to have to come up with some sort
of plan to be able to ship and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33040-2
06:05:40.734 --> 06:05:44.279
<v Ricky Horton>ideally not,
we just need to validate how we're going</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33040-3
06:05:44.279 --> 06:05:47.037
<v Ricky Horton>to get it back and get that cost out ways.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33076-0
06:05:47.437 --> 06:05:51.558
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
she doesn't have enough in rotation to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33076-1
06:05:51.558 --> 06:05:55.426
<v Ricky Horton>get, you know, longer lag. The farther,
yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33076-2
06:05:55.426 --> 06:06:02.071
<v Ricky Horton>And you mentioned like do you do I get
something back with those carts or do I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33076-3
06:06:02.071 --> 06:06:03.837
<v Ricky Horton>just do single trips?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33103-0
06:06:04.117 --> 06:06:07.512
<v Ricky Horton>And then maybe when the guys come back,
you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33103-1
06:06:07.512 --> 06:06:12.537
<v Ricky Horton>maybe we do some sort of classroom when
the guys come back for, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33103-2
06:06:12.537 --> 06:06:16.883
<v Ricky Horton>their family stuff every couple of weeks
and we just, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33103-3
06:06:16.883 --> 06:06:18.717
<v Ricky Horton>have them drive and be all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33127-0
06:06:19.237 --> 06:06:22.396
<v Ricky Horton>But if we track those,
it's as assemblies in here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33127-1
06:06:22.396 --> 06:06:27.289
<v Ricky Horton>we'd have to ship and then we'd have to
unship them as soon as they came back,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33127-2
06:06:27.289 --> 06:06:30.077
<v Ricky Horton>right?
And to feel that they'd be available.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33155-0
06:06:31.157 --> 06:06:36.293
<v Ricky Horton>You just leave it away. Yeah,
it's just to get interesting with two</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33155-1
06:06:36.293 --> 06:06:41.656
<v Ricky Horton>shops having a bunch of cars.
It's like a you're chasing those things,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33155-2
06:06:41.656 --> 06:06:45.055
<v Ricky Horton>right?
Or they disappear pretty quickly too.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33155-3
06:06:45.055 --> 06:06:47.397
<v Ricky Horton>I'm really down one attractive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33189-0
06:06:47.717 --> 06:06:53.457
<v Ricky Horton>Try to think how that would happen to her.
There's not really a mechanism in here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33189-1
06:06:53.457 --> 06:06:58.147
<v Ricky Horton>for doing that. I mean,
you could put them on the truck basically,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33189-2
06:06:58.147 --> 06:07:02.277
<v Ricky Horton>but that's you'd have to receive them in
the field, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33189-3
06:07:02.277 --> 06:07:07.037
<v Ricky Horton>Or else they can constantly show never
received, right? Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33191-0
06:07:07.317 --> 06:07:08.397
<v Ricky Horton>Um, I guess you could do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33236-0
06:07:10.597 --> 06:07:13.892
<v Ricky Horton>If you after it's received,
you can do a next step, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33236-1
06:07:13.892 --> 06:07:18.494
<v Ricky Horton>and to show return or something like that
where those assemblers constantly show</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33236-2
06:07:18.494 --> 06:07:22.585
<v Ricky Horton>it's not returned and then once they do
get returned and check back in,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33236-3
06:07:22.585 --> 06:07:25.597
<v Ricky Horton>then if you can go through the unshipping
backwards.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33270-0
06:07:26.117 --> 06:07:31.690
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm almost.
Those are what we're just talking. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33270-1
06:07:31.690 --> 06:07:37.068
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, just carts.
But there's massive stacks for these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33270-2
06:07:37.068 --> 06:07:42.641
<v Ricky Horton>things. Yeah, well,
I'm almost wondering if we were just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33270-3
06:07:42.641 --> 06:07:44.597
<v Ricky Horton>within something in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33292-0
06:07:44.677 --> 06:07:50.555
<v Ricky Horton>So there's not really anything designed
that they track this asset that goes back</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33292-1
06:07:50.555 --> 06:07:54.067
<v Ricky Horton>and forth,
but I'm wondering what the over again</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33292-2
06:07:54.067 --> 06:07:59.157
<v Ricky Horton>some of the inspections in here is pretty
much a long building, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33304-0
06:08:01.677 --> 06:08:08.397
<v Ricky Horton>And I need to try.
I need the forward inspections to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33316-0
06:08:09.517 --> 06:08:14.437
<v Ricky Horton>Scrap guys that would check out like
grinders and I'll come with you over here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33357-0
06:08:15.317 --> 06:08:19.801
<v Ricky Horton>But when they checked it out,
it was in a famous state, we'll call it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33357-1
06:08:19.801 --> 06:08:22.706
<v Ricky Horton>And then when they checked it back in,
we've,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33357-2
06:08:22.706 --> 06:08:25.990
<v Ricky Horton>you know how we were doing the follow up
and stuff,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33357-3
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:30.917
<v Ricky Horton>we've been following up and then closes
it out, you know what I'm saying? So.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33361-0
06:08:31.317 --> 06:08:34.157
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
that might be a way to do it that way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33382-0
06:08:35.637 --> 06:08:41.718
<v Ricky Horton>And that's something we could probably we
can leverage and and like some one of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33382-1
06:08:41.718 --> 06:08:45.917
<v Ricky Horton>other forums within the ERP or something
like that, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33392-0
06:08:49.317 --> 06:08:54.157
<v Ricky Horton>Or just manage it like you know like
through asset, right? Like we can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33431-0
06:08:55.517 --> 06:09:00.082
<v Ricky Horton>I think we could build it to be where it
would be very simple.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33431-1
06:09:00.082 --> 06:09:06.096
<v Ricky Horton>Once the like the field crews would come
and grab stuff and it would disappear and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33431-2
06:09:06.096 --> 06:09:09.646
<v Ricky Horton>be gone.
We never knew if we got it back or not,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33431-3
06:09:09.646 --> 06:09:13.197
<v Ricky Horton>right?
So we had to build that to this job site.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33455-0
06:09:13.557 --> 06:09:16.581
<v Ricky Horton>We got back on this date.
Here's the token.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33455-1
06:09:16.581 --> 06:09:20.154
<v Ricky Horton>So if we never saw it come back,
we'd be like, hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33455-2
06:09:20.154 --> 06:09:23.316
<v Ricky Horton>you grabbed us a week ago. Where is it?
Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33455-3
06:09:23.316 --> 06:09:28.677
<v Ricky Horton>So I wonder how Mark can just track those
cards. The what? The tool room guy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33457-0
06:09:28.757 --> 06:09:29.117
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33480-0
06:09:32.917 --> 06:09:39.290
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see really.
We'll get back together tomorrow.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33480-1
06:09:39.290 --> 06:09:45.544
<v Ricky Horton>Is that great?
I wondered if between now and then we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33480-2
06:09:45.544 --> 06:09:47.197
<v Ricky Horton>take like the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33512-0
06:09:48.597 --> 06:09:52.438
<v Ricky Horton>Bill of material that you were that we
were just looking at,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33512-1
06:09:52.438 --> 06:09:57.602
<v Ricky Horton>get the whole thing and where we can get
it to the important and then kind of OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33512-2
06:09:57.602 --> 06:10:01.570
<v Ricky Horton>here's your release.
Let's walk it all the way through and say</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33512-3
06:10:01.570 --> 06:10:03.837
<v Ricky Horton>set one package. Let's go ahead and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33536-0
06:10:04.117 --> 06:10:11.296
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be the next thing forward or getting
on that list and just kind of walk it all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33536-1
06:10:11.296 --> 06:10:16.167
<v Ricky Horton>the way through.
It it it it all sounds to me that if we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33536-2
06:10:16.167 --> 06:10:19.757
<v Ricky Horton>really do it then we'll run across issues.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33553-0
06:10:20.197 --> 06:10:25.908
<v Ricky Horton>What would be good if we could get that?
Is there a way to get that electronically</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33553-1
06:10:25.908 --> 06:10:30.037
<v Ricky Horton>rather than a PDF? That's what.
Let me see if I can get um.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33576-0
06:10:33.077 --> 06:10:41.609
<v Ricky Horton>That way is I can get the Excel one you
just released out of the project PDF</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33576-1
06:10:41.609 --> 06:10:48.037
<v Ricky Horton>throw out the check that we need to put
in the Excel for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33603-0
06:10:48.997 --> 06:10:53.616
<v Ricky Horton>That's intensities.
So on that wiring I think I did really</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33603-1
06:10:53.616 --> 06:10:58.313
<v Ricky Horton>kind of unrelated,
but I used chat to do the nesting on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33603-2
06:10:58.313 --> 06:11:01.837
<v Ricky Horton>wire and it's utilization came down to
like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33630-0
06:11:02.837 --> 06:11:08.095
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, I think we have like 15% drop. Oh,
and then they went to tech room.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33630-1
06:11:08.095 --> 06:11:13.135
<v Ricky Horton>We got what, like like a percent if that.
Yeah, it's like .04. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33630-2
06:11:13.135 --> 06:11:18.466
<v Ricky Horton>that's where you got, you know,
really worrisome on how we're gonna take</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33630-3
06:11:18.466 --> 06:11:19.197
<v Ricky Horton>off, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33638-0
06:11:28.677 --> 06:11:36.997
<v Ricky Horton>When when you know the database,
we can just export out the export out the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33670-0
06:11:38.037 --> 06:11:43.367
<v Ricky Horton>I'm curious if they did it the way I
asked them to, or they just copied it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33670-1
06:11:43.367 --> 06:11:47.364
<v Ricky Horton>If it's a big machine instance and it has
it in the end,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33670-2
06:11:47.364 --> 06:11:53.045
<v Ricky Horton>we see disable all the other sizes, yeah,
and then then it'll just be catered to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33670-3
06:11:53.045 --> 06:11:53.957
<v Ricky Horton>what we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33705-0
06:11:54.357 --> 06:11:59.206
<v Ricky Horton>We can clear out everything we don't need,
yeah. And then if it's not,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33705-1
06:11:59.206 --> 06:12:04.465
<v Ricky Horton>then then we can take that export and
yeah, push them through. Because yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33705-2
06:12:04.465 --> 06:12:07.811
<v Ricky Horton>my guess,
considering how many times I went back</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33705-3
06:12:07.811 --> 06:12:09.997
<v Ricky Horton>and forth with IT on this, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33744-0
06:12:10.277 --> 06:12:14.394
<v Ricky Horton>They copied and pasted the same instance
in a separate port.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33744-1
06:12:14.394 --> 06:12:19.860
<v Ricky Horton>So if you just say installed in service,
they will have the other ones selected.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33744-2
06:12:19.860 --> 06:12:25.462
<v Ricky Horton>They will just read the there's no copy.
Yeah, yeah, that's my guess. Any concern?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33744-3
06:12:25.462 --> 06:12:27.757
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't heard back from you yet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33753-0
06:12:28.037 --> 06:12:33.117
<v Ricky Horton>I mean what's going on with it 'cause
this this admin is incredibly slow.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33759-0
06:12:38.357 --> 06:12:41.277
<v Ricky Horton>We must keep maybe is a call that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33762-0
06:12:42.757 --> 06:12:44.077
<v Ricky Horton>So this we have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33765-0
06:12:46.277 --> 06:12:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>I don't work. Take care of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33785-0
06:12:55.557 --> 06:13:00.107
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we can do that.
There's no reason we can't have it in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33785-1
06:13:00.107 --> 06:13:04.961
<v Ricky Horton>here with the regular stuff,
but we can also keep it separated,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33785-2
06:13:04.961 --> 06:13:07.237
<v Ricky Horton>just keep it clean. So we get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33828-0
06:13:09.877 --> 06:13:12.680
<v Ricky Horton>I've got,
I've got a copy of the blank database,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33828-1
06:13:12.680 --> 06:13:15.312
<v Ricky Horton>so I mean not blank without the box
database.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33828-2
06:13:15.312 --> 06:13:19.947
<v Ricky Horton>So if on the other one we just want to
say I don't want to have to take the time</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33828-3
06:13:19.947 --> 06:13:24.638
<v Ricky Horton>to get through and wipe out everything
you got in there and you want to be clean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33828-4
06:13:24.638 --> 06:13:27.957
<v Ricky Horton>we can just restore it. Well,
we got to have it restored.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33862-0
06:13:27.957 --> 06:13:33.920
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but several of the processes here,
reaching back out to IT needs and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33862-1
06:13:33.920 --> 06:13:38.133
<v Ricky Horton>assistance. Yeah,
it's not too hard to join. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33862-2
06:13:38.133 --> 06:13:42.824
<v Ricky Horton>it'll be a big ask,
even I'm sure it'll be a real problem.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33862-3
06:13:42.824 --> 06:13:46.482

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33862-4
06:13:46.482 --> 06:13:47.277

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33866-0
06:13:47.597 --> 06:13:52.317

don't need? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33895-0
06:13:54.997 --> 06:14:00.604
<v Ricky Horton>So if you had done it all and that it was
all red, so everything, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33895-1

06:14:20.997 --> 06:14:26.338
<v Ricky Horton>He just dropped it in the folder.
So I know it was there. It wasn't it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33938-1
06:14:26.338 --> 06:14:29.824

06:14:29.824 --> 06:14:35.832
<v Ricky Horton>did I really not grab that one? I'm like,
it must have been so many years to let</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33938-3
06:14:35.832 --> 06:14:36.797

06:14:40.661 --> 06:14:47.792
<v Ricky Horton>possibilities for me to look at that and
go. I don't need that. I do need that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/33957-2
06:14:47.792 --> 06:14:49.397

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34260-0
06:20:57.997 --> 06:21:02.063
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yes Sir. Cool.
Can you pull up what and show us what's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34260-1
06:21:02.063 --> 06:21:05.597
<v Ricky Horton>available?
I want to see if we can add some stuff to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34260-2
06:21:05.597 --> 06:21:05.997
<v Ricky Horton>it to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34272-0
06:21:23.637 --> 06:21:31.437
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, don't think so. I know it's how.
I know it's how you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34273-0
06:21:35.557 --> 06:21:37.037
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34274-0
06:21:41.397 --> 06:21:41.957
<v Ricky Horton>Alright.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34279-0
06:21:44.797 --> 06:21:47.357
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, I was able to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34290-0
06:21:55.157 --> 06:22:00.557
<v Ricky Horton>It's going back. So what?
Can you pull it down the the charter? Yes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34293-0
06:22:04.717 --> 06:22:06.277
<v Ricky Horton>So what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34295-0
06:22:13.477 --> 06:22:15.117
<v Ricky Horton>Awesome. Thanks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34299-0
06:22:21.077 --> 06:22:22.317
<v Ricky Horton>So go back to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34309-0
06:22:28.917 --> 06:22:35.357
<v Ricky Horton>So we have so label is needed.
It needs to be exact order, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34338-0
06:22:36.917 --> 06:22:39.852
<v Ricky Horton>If it's not in this order,
I can just remap it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34338-1
06:22:39.852 --> 06:22:43.889
<v Ricky Horton>As long as it has those,
I'll just tell it what column to look at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34338-2
06:22:43.889 --> 06:22:46.397
<v Ricky Horton>for what data. OK, so so they're drawing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34341-0
06:22:48.037 --> 06:22:49.517
<v Ricky Horton>We have found.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34349-0
06:22:51.077 --> 06:22:54.957
<v Ricky Horton>But the count is only really applying to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34358-0
06:22:57.317 --> 06:23:01.136
<v Ricky Horton>The overall assembly,
but it's giving me piece mark which I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34358-1
06:23:01.136 --> 06:23:01.837
<v Ricky Horton>should try.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34359-0
06:23:07.677 --> 06:23:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>Bad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34373-0
06:23:15.837 --> 06:23:20.597
<v Ricky Horton>It'll automatically assign weights, right?
Based on, based on report and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34392-0
06:23:21.557 --> 06:23:27.769
<v Ricky Horton>I mean create anything you know this can
you we're not assigning grades in here at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34392-1
06:23:27.769 --> 06:23:31.437
<v Ricky Horton>all as far as on this on the strap while
it was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34396-0
06:23:34.917 --> 06:23:44.037
<v Ricky Horton>If there's something I can redo it,
I'll see.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34427-0
06:23:49.237 --> 06:23:57.250
<v Ricky Horton>So if I wanted to essentially if I wanted
to reorganize this to where see we have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34427-1
06:23:57.250 --> 06:24:04.677
<v Ricky Horton>our label and then our labels can be our
and then and I would want another.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34453-0
06:24:05.237 --> 06:24:13.595
<v Ricky Horton>Why after that it's where the label it
would be the label would read like R1 and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34453-1
06:24:13.595 --> 06:24:22.057
<v Ricky Horton>then the last three digits of the label
just so I can increase a part for the raw</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34453-2
06:24:22.057 --> 06:24:22.677
<v Ricky Horton>links.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34461-0
06:24:27.437 --> 06:24:30.277
<v Ricky Horton>He's running in here. Yeah,
so I wouldn't wanna.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34474-0
06:24:31.237 --> 06:24:36.637
<v Ricky Horton>So essentially we had all this list to
cover, so I would want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34483-0
06:24:37.837 --> 06:24:41.597
<v Ricky Horton>Another label and then it'd be label.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34490-0
06:24:43.077 --> 06:24:46.557
<v Ricky Horton>I see it wrong, but I have a second.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34499-0
06:24:47.997 --> 06:24:52.877
<v Ricky Horton>So I would wanted to add another column
in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34500-0
06:24:56.797 --> 06:24:56.877
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34503-0
06:25:04.677 --> 06:25:06.597
<v Ricky Horton>So this is but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34509-0
06:25:07.557 --> 06:25:11.757
<v Ricky Horton>I can send you a screenshot.
You can send it to one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34514-0
06:25:23.517 --> 06:25:27.117
<v Ricky Horton>Just in all of them to share.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34550-0
06:25:40.477 --> 06:25:47.575
<v Ricky Horton>So you see what we need to do is we need
to create a piece mark for the rod that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34550-1
06:25:47.575 --> 06:25:54.585
<v Ricky Horton>ties it to what our main markings for the
actual trip pieces separately, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34550-2
06:25:54.585 --> 06:25:57.477
<v Ricky Horton>So so I can have first T1 and C1.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34552-0
06:25:58.197 --> 06:25:59.357
<v Ricky Horton>There, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34583-0
06:26:01.317 --> 06:26:07.514
<v Ricky Horton>We have, you know, it's 40 units,
shredded few thousands and then you have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34583-1
06:26:07.514 --> 06:26:11.645
<v Ricky Horton>four half of troughs that are going to be
RR one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34583-2
06:26:11.645 --> 06:26:17.677
<v Ricky Horton>3 digits from the piece mark that R23
digits from the piece mark, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34589-0
06:26:18.197 --> 06:26:22.547
<v Ricky Horton>And we see how that ties to the main mark.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34591-0
06:26:26.837 --> 06:26:29.517
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, Paul, how how that looks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34600-0
06:26:32.357 --> 06:26:35.637
<v Ricky Horton>Can you see if you can manipulate that
Excel spreadsheet?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34609-0
06:26:36.637 --> 06:26:40.292
<v Ricky Horton>Or I'm sorry,
the right he went to kind of look like</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34609-1
06:26:40.292 --> 06:26:40.637
<v Ricky Horton>this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34611-0
06:26:42.037 --> 06:26:43.117
<v Ricky Horton>I get it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34622-0
06:26:54.397 --> 06:26:55.837
<v Ricky Horton>OK, that's not my.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34623-0
06:26:57.437 --> 06:26:57.837
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34655-0
06:27:01.277 --> 06:27:07.046
<v Ricky Horton>It's probably just like fully stubbed.
It's not okay anything right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34655-1
06:27:07.046 --> 06:27:11.896
<v Ricky Horton>It's not right.
But it's like in the future and then that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34655-2
06:27:11.896 --> 06:27:17.499
<v Ricky Horton>stuff's gonna check here.
It's whatever parameter in your can pull</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34655-3
06:27:17.499 --> 06:27:17.917
<v Ricky Horton>from.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34658-0
06:27:18.717 --> 06:27:20.477
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, Cortana.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34676-0
06:27:22.877 --> 06:27:27.867
<v Ricky Horton>And because Excel,
we want to have those kind of,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34676-1
06:27:27.867 --> 06:27:33.357
<v Ricky Horton>so we're just gonna privacy to give them
a little bit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34691-0
06:27:34.797 --> 06:27:40.397
<v Ricky Horton>Um, to have all these parameters? Yeah.
So why don't you just give me?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34710-0
06:27:42.317 --> 06:27:49.701
<v Ricky Horton>Just give me the Excel export of just
that version one and I I think I just it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34710-1
06:27:49.701 --> 06:27:50.917
<v Ricky Horton>within Excel.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34714-0
06:27:51.797 --> 06:27:53.917
<v Ricky Horton>So you're gonna be a back work and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34732-0
06:27:56.917 --> 06:28:03.968
<v Ricky Horton>And then we can work getting up the with
the team to get our actually many of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34732-1
06:28:03.968 --> 06:28:08.037
<v Ricky Horton>their panels or these will be ones to
match.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34742-0
06:28:13.517 --> 06:28:18.876
<v Ricky Horton>Have used to be fair. Well, yeah,
this is the way this was built, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34742-1
06:28:18.876 --> 06:28:19.757
<v Ricky Horton>We're still.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34744-0
06:28:26.797 --> 06:28:27.517
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34796-0
06:28:57.317 --> 06:29:02.057
<v Ricky Horton>Are we simple on that?
That's how's have we done the process of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34796-1
06:29:02.057 --> 06:29:05.316
<v Ricky Horton>getting like codings that that's all it
is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34796-2
06:29:05.316 --> 06:29:11.316
<v Ricky Horton>Are we seeing it be the same when we're
not given any sort of like actual files,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34796-3
06:29:11.316 --> 06:29:16.797
<v Ricky Horton>we're doing the same Excel import or how
are we doing that? I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34832-0
06:29:17.157 --> 06:29:20.821
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
most of the coatings customers have been</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34832-1
06:29:20.821 --> 06:29:24.875
<v Ricky Horton>supplying KISS files without without the
KISS file.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34832-2
06:29:24.875 --> 06:29:29.475
<v Ricky Horton>We did kind of guess any chances of all
the manual boards,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34832-3
06:29:29.475 --> 06:29:33.997
<v Ricky Horton>but that that would be probably about the
only other way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34871-0
06:29:34.797 --> 06:29:39.461
<v Ricky Horton>Would be manual imports and index out
imports. We can do the same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34871-1
06:29:39.461 --> 06:29:44.542
<v Ricky Horton>So the pro shot we've been getting better
as files. Yeah, alright, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34871-2
06:29:44.542 --> 06:29:49.067
<v Ricky Horton>especially with the one that's coming up
for TSMC, that's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34871-3
06:29:49.067 --> 06:29:50.877
<v Ricky Horton>We're good to go in place.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34902-0
06:29:51.077 --> 06:29:54.326
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
importing for the scope that they're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34902-1
06:29:54.326 --> 06:29:59.995
<v Ricky Horton>going to get that wording and that's all
importing pretty easily in there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34902-2
06:29:59.995 --> 06:30:05.587
<v Ricky Horton>So I have all that working out,
but it doesn't need from the great little</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34902-3
06:30:05.587 --> 06:30:08.157
<v Ricky Horton>stuff we weren't getting a lot of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34911-0
06:30:08.997 --> 06:30:12.957
<v Ricky Horton>Locked in test files. So are you um?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34970-0
06:30:15.237 --> 06:30:20.851
<v Ricky Horton>Are you trying to get PFXD files on your
jugs rather than kiss files? Yes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34970-1
06:30:20.851 --> 06:30:26.766
<v Ricky Horton>because kiss files are going to go away.
So yeah, they're a good job. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34970-2
06:30:26.766 --> 06:30:30.659
<v Ricky Horton>and with them,
with them you can do the kiss files,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/34970-3
06:30:30.659 --> 06:30:34.477
<v Ricky Horton>they export out of their spermis and then
give us.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35016-0
06:30:34.677 --> 06:30:39.232
<v Ricky Horton>Their own sets. Um, but yeah,
they've been doing kiss files and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35016-1
06:30:39.232 --> 06:30:43.392
<v Ricky Horton>we've been getting IFCS. Um,
verifies that their IFCS exported</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35016-2
06:30:43.392 --> 06:30:47.089
<v Ricky Horton>fabrication views so we can use it on the
HoloLens. Um,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35016-3
06:30:47.089 --> 06:30:51.117
<v Ricky Horton>but I did at least have an IFC that I can
upload in Trimble.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35049-0
06:30:51.397 --> 06:30:54.704
<v Ricky Horton>Problems that they do like weekly updates
on it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35049-1
06:30:54.704 --> 06:30:58.349
<v Ricky Horton>So we get a new IRC every single week
with revisions.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35049-2
06:30:58.349 --> 06:31:01.724
<v Ricky Horton>What are we using on codings of the
HoloLens? Uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35049-3
06:31:01.724 --> 06:31:06.517
<v Ricky Horton>nothing for codings of the HoloLens
that's all kind of stuff, but but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35091-0
06:31:06.557 --> 06:31:14.219
<v Ricky Horton>For for files that we've been requesting
that are actually giving IFCS kiss files,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35091-1
06:31:14.219 --> 06:31:21.051
<v Ricky Horton>they have not supplied a PFXD file as of
yet. So but we talk about, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35091-2
06:31:21.051 --> 06:31:26.037
<v Ricky Horton>what's that part of what we got is that
PFXD file is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35097-0
06:31:26.317 --> 06:31:31.077
<v Ricky Horton>You need that, yeah,
but if the details are showing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35135-0
06:31:32.677 --> 06:31:37.930
<v Ricky Horton>Detailing and SDS or which is probably
the case. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35135-1
06:31:37.930 --> 06:31:43.660
<v Ricky Horton>sometimes it takes a little longer to.
Yeah, for. But yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35135-2
06:31:43.660 --> 06:31:50.537
<v Ricky Horton>I have this all set up in here.
I just need to Add all the routing that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35135-3
06:31:50.537 --> 06:31:51.397
<v Ricky Horton>we added.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35141-0
06:31:51.757 --> 06:32:00.277
<v Ricky Horton>A complex paint route.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35190-0
06:32:01.917 --> 06:32:06.183
<v Ricky Horton>So you can kind of see what we broke out
yesterday.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35190-1
06:32:06.183 --> 06:32:12.337
<v Ricky Horton>So now now they'll have the ability to
track their prep, intermediate pro,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35190-2
06:32:12.337 --> 06:32:18.982
<v Ricky Horton>prime and finish pro for the complex and
and all of these can be marked up in EP</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35190-3
06:32:18.982 --> 06:32:19.557
<v Ricky Horton>and go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35218-0
06:32:19.957 --> 06:32:26.672
<v Ricky Horton>And then we also created an inspection
report for them for their service prep in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35218-1
06:32:26.672 --> 06:32:33.470
<v Ricky Horton>our inspection area so that they can do
and Moe was a little hesitant to get away</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35218-2
06:32:33.470 --> 06:32:34.797
<v Ricky Horton>from site talks.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35246-0
06:32:35.717 --> 06:32:42.184
<v Ricky Horton>But most of all of his reports can be
redone in here and done from UPN go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35246-1
06:32:42.184 --> 06:32:48.737
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm assuming in the future once we
actually get kicked out the site that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35246-2
06:32:48.737 --> 06:32:50.117
<v Ricky Horton>slowly if we do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35250-0
06:32:50.477 --> 06:32:52.957
<v Ricky Horton>All of that stuff can be transferred in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35251-0
06:32:53.837 --> 06:32:54.917
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35269-0
06:32:57.357 --> 06:33:03.548
<v Ricky Horton>We also tweaked the we added three
different coating types,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35269-1
06:33:03.548 --> 06:33:09.637
<v Ricky Horton>so we got the high solids,
the steel spec and macro epoxy.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35317-0
06:33:19.557 --> 06:33:24.987
<v Ricky Horton>So we added all these in and we
configured the container sizes for what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35317-1
06:33:24.987 --> 06:33:29.135
<v Ricky Horton>their purchasable units are and their
cost per gallon,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35317-2
06:33:29.135 --> 06:33:34.868
<v Ricky Horton>which might have to be updated if that
does change and then their coverage.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35317-3
06:33:34.868 --> 06:33:37.357
<v Ricky Horton>So estimates when we plug one in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35350-0
06:33:37.477 --> 06:33:42.063
<v Ricky Horton>Should be pretty on point with exactly
what they're looking for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35350-1
06:33:42.063 --> 06:33:47.707
<v Ricky Horton>As for what our estimates summary will
show for how many gallons they need over</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35350-2
06:33:47.707 --> 06:33:52.717
<v Ricky Horton>the price on the summary and and the
square footage usages, does that?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35369-0
06:33:53.557 --> 06:34:00.888
<v Ricky Horton>Does that description carry through on
travelers at all? No, it doesn't. Uh,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35369-1
06:34:00.888 --> 06:34:07.077
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't doesn't. So I did.
We did end up adding into production.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35410-0
06:34:07.997 --> 06:34:13.932
<v Ricky Horton>Additional finishes in here.
So we do have complex SP2SP3SP6 as well</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35410-1
06:34:13.932 --> 06:34:19.954
<v Ricky Horton>as simple SP one through 6.
So we'll at least have a prep call out to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35410-2
06:34:19.954 --> 06:34:23.997
<v Ricky Horton>finish and that will show up on the
travelers.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35449-0
06:34:24.477 --> 06:34:28.358
<v Ricky Horton>But you can kind of adjust the finishes
however we want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35449-1
06:34:28.358 --> 06:34:34.078
<v Ricky Horton>So if we wanted to add the paint spec and
the surface prep spec in there, we could.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35449-2
06:34:34.078 --> 06:34:39.117
<v Ricky Horton>It's just gonna make a list that didn't
come along. No, I I just want to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35464-0
06:34:40.157 --> 06:34:44.498
<v Ricky Horton>We have a hard time getting the details
on board with right specs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35464-1
06:34:44.498 --> 06:34:46.637
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to make sure that we.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35489-0
06:34:47.517 --> 06:34:51.569
<v Ricky Horton>The process right now is that submittal
travels with it, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35489-1
06:34:51.569 --> 06:34:56.571
<v Ricky Horton>So they reference to the actual submittal.
So I just wanna make sure we're not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35489-2
06:34:56.571 --> 06:34:58.597
<v Ricky Horton>possibly conflicting data, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35532-0
06:34:59.757 --> 06:35:05.489
<v Ricky Horton>No, we should be good there. None of that.
All those other ones we were just looking</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35532-1
06:35:05.489 --> 06:35:10.412
<v Ricky Horton>at are just on the estimate side.
So those are options you can pick when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35532-2
06:35:10.412 --> 06:35:13.514
<v Ricky Horton>you're starting a new job.
If you're in here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35532-3
06:35:13.514 --> 06:35:16.077
<v Ricky Horton>you can go into your paid systems and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35572-0
06:35:16.837 --> 06:35:22.221
<v Ricky Horton>And go in here and move over multiple
codes and do custom systems and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35572-1
06:35:22.221 --> 06:35:26.816
<v Ricky Horton>clean systems as well.
If you were doing an SP2 and an SP6 then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35572-2
06:35:26.816 --> 06:35:32.200
<v Ricky Horton>you can account for the layer for
multiple systems for singular systems on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35572-3
06:35:32.200 --> 06:35:33.277
<v Ricky Horton>your estimates.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35573-0
06:35:33.957 --> 06:35:34.917
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35611-0
06:35:41.757 --> 06:35:46.996
<v Ricky Horton>We got that redialed in yesterday and and
adjusted the labor in there so that it's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35611-1
06:35:46.996 --> 06:35:52.047
<v Ricky Horton>matching what Moe's been calculating out
for one man hour permanent square foot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35611-2
06:35:52.047 --> 06:35:56.277
<v Ricky Horton>and one man hour permanent square foot
for private and private so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35613-0
06:35:57.717 --> 06:35:59.957
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35660-0
06:36:03.917 --> 06:36:07.990
<v Ricky Horton>Today we've kind of been messing with
adjusting labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35660-1
06:36:07.990 --> 06:36:13.545
<v Ricky Horton>So we adjusted a couple of the well
deposition rates in there because they</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35660-2
06:36:13.545 --> 06:36:19.322
<v Ricky Horton>were some of the out-of-the-box rates.
So we increased some because the rates</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35660-3
06:36:19.322 --> 06:36:22.877
<v Ricky Horton>were really slow in there.
So we dialed up the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35695-0
06:36:22.877 --> 06:36:31.203
<v Ricky Horton>The feet feet per minute or feet per hour
in here for quarter range, 516 and 3/8,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35695-1
06:36:31.203 --> 06:36:38.920
<v Ricky Horton>our most basic movements and then also
learning and increase our fit time a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35695-2
06:36:38.920 --> 06:36:40.037
<v Ricky Horton>little bit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35741-0
06:36:40.437 --> 06:36:45.962
<v Ricky Horton>So our well time went down a little bit
time increased a little which is usually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35741-1
06:36:45.962 --> 06:36:50.873
<v Ricky Horton>what we notice maybe most of our
adjustments on our projects is that it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35741-2
06:36:50.873 --> 06:36:56.125
<v Ricky Horton>needs a little bit more involvement is
usually a little over so so and we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35741-3
06:36:56.125 --> 06:36:58.717
<v Ricky Horton>working to continue to fine tune that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35776-0
06:36:59.277 --> 06:37:04.292
<v Ricky Horton>Looking at historical projects,
we haven't gotten to a point where we've</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35776-1
06:37:04.292 --> 06:37:09.377
<v Ricky Horton>been able to identify specifically where
our issues are coming into play.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35776-2
06:37:09.377 --> 06:37:13.637
<v Ricky Horton>So it's been kind of like new adjustments
at this point, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35810-0
06:37:14.157 --> 06:37:19.451
<v Ricky Horton>Plan to continue to look at existing
projects and we see breakouts and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35810-1
06:37:19.451 --> 06:37:25.343
<v Ricky Horton>estimates and compare actuals versus
estimated versus supplied meaning we kind</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35810-2
06:37:25.343 --> 06:37:28.997
<v Ricky Horton>of get our numbers to all jive across the
board.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35818-0
06:37:30.117 --> 06:37:35.757
<v Ricky Horton>So so the actual back end right the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35836-0
06:37:38.077 --> 06:37:43.113
<v Ricky Horton>One of the issues has always been with
what you're, which is, right,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35836-1
06:37:43.113 --> 06:37:48.077
<v Ricky Horton>what you're actually will linear for the
what was done versus what.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35862-0
06:37:49.517 --> 06:37:54.829
<v Ricky Horton>What you've got to estimate, right?
And so it's hard to, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35862-1
06:37:54.829 --> 06:38:00.776
<v Ricky Horton>if you wait the hours done to what you
estimated was actually done, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35862-2
06:38:00.776 --> 06:38:02.917
<v Ricky Horton>And so you have to kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35864-0
06:38:04.157 --> 06:38:05.037
<v Ricky Horton>But the way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35886-0
06:38:06.717 --> 06:38:11.662
<v Ricky Horton>Unless we dig into everything and spend a
lot of time processing the PXT or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35886-1
06:38:11.662 --> 06:38:16.151
<v Ricky Horton>whatever the import is on it,
we're not gonna come up with an actual</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35886-2
06:38:16.151 --> 06:38:16.477
<v Ricky Horton>true.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35889-0
06:38:17.517 --> 06:38:20.117
<v Ricky Horton>What was detailed of what was done,
correct?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35939-0
06:38:20.957 --> 06:38:25.042
<v Ricky Horton>We talked about like if I have 500 hours
on the estimate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35939-1
06:38:25.042 --> 06:38:29.691
<v Ricky Horton>but with the work that flight sort of
record should be 600 hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35939-2
06:38:29.691 --> 06:38:34.833
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying 78 feet of Weld that was
estimated based on all the clips and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35939-3
06:38:34.833 --> 06:38:38.637
<v Ricky Horton>everything,
but in reality we did 87 feet of welding.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35986-0
06:38:41.317 --> 06:38:46.114
<v Ricky Horton>Because it was detailed different. Yeah,
it's any one of the estimated versus</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35986-1
06:38:46.114 --> 06:38:50.358
<v Ricky Horton>actions, right. Like, so it's,
it's I mean it's estimated versus you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35986-2
06:38:50.358 --> 06:38:53.372
<v Ricky Horton>know what was assumed, right.
And then you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/35986-3
06:38:53.372 --> 06:38:58.477
<v Ricky Horton>let's say it took about 10 month clips or
something like that, right. Or yeah, or.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36015-0
06:38:58.717 --> 06:39:03.098
<v Ricky Horton>Whatever happen in detail,
we didn't need as many connection links</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36015-1
06:39:03.098 --> 06:39:08.264
<v Ricky Horton>or something like that, right? So change.
So that's kinda so especially, well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36015-2
06:39:08.264 --> 06:39:11.206
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
I think going cuts very easy because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36015-3
06:39:11.206 --> 06:39:13.757
<v Ricky Horton>those are pretty close to always being.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36020-0
06:39:13.997 --> 06:39:18.797
<v Ricky Horton>Actually, but uh,
the wells have always been kind of uh.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36067-0
06:39:19.917 --> 06:39:24.705
<v Ricky Horton>You don't want to divide it back into
what was estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36067-1
06:39:24.705 --> 06:39:30.980
<v Ricky Horton>So one way you can account for somebody
in here, it's not an exact science,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36067-2
06:39:30.980 --> 06:39:36.677
<v Ricky Horton>but when you link the production control
down back to that estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36111-0
06:39:37.037 --> 06:39:44.125
<v Ricky Horton>It can bring those hours over and apply
it to the material that's in production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36111-1
06:39:44.125 --> 06:39:48.645
<v Ricky Horton>control.
Now what it does is it does it on a hours</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36111-2
06:39:48.645 --> 06:39:53.429
<v Ricky Horton>per ton basis.
So if if it's like OK they you know my</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36111-3
06:39:53.429 --> 06:39:56.797
<v Ricky Horton>base plate sizes have decreased my NA.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36157-0
06:39:56.797 --> 06:40:00.185
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, like you said,
a bunch of folks are going, well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36157-1
06:40:00.185 --> 06:40:05.052
<v Ricky Horton>then you get less hours in there because
that happened, but it's doing it off.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36157-2
06:40:05.052 --> 06:40:09.611
<v Ricky Horton>It's not looking at every nature well
because it doesn't know that on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36157-3
06:40:09.611 --> 06:40:13.677
<v Ricky Horton>production control side.
It does on this credit side, right? But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36208-0
06:40:13.757 --> 06:40:18.633
<v Ricky Horton>That that helps a lot of shots from the
standpoint of what the shots stream</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36208-1
06:40:18.633 --> 06:40:22.610
<v Ricky Horton>because they're like,
I'm always over on hours because you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36208-2
06:40:22.610 --> 06:40:27.550
<v Ricky Horton>judging me based off of the estimated
hours and things changed and there's a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36208-3
06:40:27.550 --> 06:40:30.950
<v Ricky Horton>lot more work,
plus all these change orders going in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36208-4
06:40:30.950 --> 06:40:33.517
<v Ricky Horton>there. You're not crediting me for that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-0
06:40:33.597 --> 06:40:36.450
<v Ricky Horton>Well, once that,
once it gets production control,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-1
06:40:36.450 --> 06:40:39.816
<v Ricky Horton>it calculates hours.
So it can't account for some of that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-2
06:40:39.816 --> 06:40:44.438
<v Ricky Horton>It's not an exact science at that stage.
So once it gets brought into production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-3
06:40:44.438 --> 06:40:47.063
<v Ricky Horton>control,
we're essentially reestablishing our</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-4
06:40:47.063 --> 06:40:50.714
<v Ricky Horton>labor budgets based off of the the
revenue series, right? Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36272-5
06:40:50.714 --> 06:40:52.997
<v Ricky Horton>that's actually what the base hours are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36302-0
06:40:53.277 --> 06:40:58.446
<v Ricky Horton>In that projects here is those hours
going to look for deduction trials and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36302-1
06:40:58.446 --> 06:41:04.023
<v Ricky Horton>what that does is there's estimated hours
in the schedule as well and it compares</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36302-2
06:41:04.023 --> 06:41:08.717
<v Ricky Horton>the estimated to the base hours.
Let's say we had 500 hours for one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36350-0
06:41:08.757 --> 06:41:14.842
<v Ricky Horton>For one sequence in the estimated hours
and but base hours was 575 and we used</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36350-1
06:41:14.842 --> 06:41:18.617
<v Ricky Horton>the 575 instead of the 500 because it
said yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36350-2
06:41:18.617 --> 06:41:24.240
<v Ricky Horton>you said 500 hours on the estimate,
but he really got 575 hours of work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36350-3
06:41:24.240 --> 06:41:28.477
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're using, right?
That's what this base.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36380-0
06:41:28.677 --> 06:41:33.977
<v Ricky Horton>So we're using adjusted adjustments
incorrectly. It will not do it that way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36380-1
06:41:33.977 --> 06:41:39.622
<v Ricky Horton>The way I described if you're using the
estimated hours in the adjustment column,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36380-2
06:41:39.622 --> 06:41:42.788
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
but right now they're using adjustment as</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36380-3
06:41:42.788 --> 06:41:43.477
<v Ricky Horton>estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36418-0
06:41:44.037 --> 06:41:47.861
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's what I was here.
Is that correct?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36418-1
06:41:47.861 --> 06:41:54.474
<v Ricky Horton>The adjustment is essentially we plug the
adjustment in based on whatever the base</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36418-2
06:41:54.474 --> 06:41:59.732
<v Ricky Horton>hours are showing to get it to match what
we have released to us.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36418-3
06:41:59.732 --> 06:42:03.477
<v Ricky Horton>So analyze it 50 and our base hours show
that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36450-0
06:42:03.757 --> 06:42:09.793
<v Ricky Horton>It's 39 and we'll plug the difference in
there so that our who is the source,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36450-1
06:42:09.793 --> 06:42:15.442
<v Ricky Horton>who's the source of base hours,
base hours is based upon production. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36450-2
06:42:15.442 --> 06:42:19.157
<v Ricky Horton>so estimated hours need to be shown so so
your.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36489-0
06:42:19.677 --> 06:42:25.242
<v Ricky Horton>You're constantly changing the adjustment
yet to keep it at the hours you want,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36489-1
06:42:25.242 --> 06:42:28.511
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yeah.
So if you would put the estimated</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36489-2
06:42:28.511 --> 06:42:32.129
<v Ricky Horton>estimate,
you won't have to do that because it's so</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36489-3
06:42:32.129 --> 06:42:37.277
<v Ricky Horton>like on let's see the one line that has
base size of 1614 and adjustment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36521-0
06:42:37.677 --> 06:42:43.295
<v Ricky Horton>So you got a total plan hours of 30.
See that one right there? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36521-1
06:42:43.295 --> 06:42:47.774
<v Ricky Horton>So that one,
if you had 30 hours and estimated with 16</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36521-2
06:42:47.774 --> 06:42:51.682
<v Ricky Horton>in base,
it assumes the other 14 are coming and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36521-3
06:42:51.682 --> 06:42:55.917
<v Ricky Horton>and your and your planned hours are going
to be 30.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36565-0
06:42:56.157 --> 06:43:03.407
<v Ricky Horton>Save hours is coming out of the actual
time work and how much they've done so</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36565-1
06:43:03.407 --> 06:43:07.776
<v Ricky Horton>far.
It's basically takes the hours the pieces</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36565-2
06:43:07.776 --> 06:43:15.212
<v Ricky Horton>that are in production control to get to
get those hours and complete them. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36565-3
06:43:15.212 --> 06:43:15.677
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-0
06:43:15.797 --> 06:43:18.311
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.
We're not manipulating data because we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-1
06:43:18.311 --> 06:43:20.826
<v Ricky Horton>want to.
We're manipulating it because we have to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-2
06:43:20.826 --> 06:43:23.439
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Well,
it's something that doesn't really we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-3
06:43:23.439 --> 06:43:26.496
<v Ricky Horton>not. We're not. Yeah.
We're not manipulating the data because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-4
06:43:26.496 --> 06:43:29.011
<v Ricky Horton>we want to.
We're manipulating the data because we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-5
06:43:29.011 --> 06:43:33.005
<v Ricky Horton>have to because like that's not pulling
anything over from an original estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36618-6
06:43:33.005 --> 06:43:35.717
<v Ricky Horton>But what I'm saying is you're you're
doing it because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-0
06:43:35.717 --> 06:43:38.146
<v Ricky Horton>You want that line to be 30 hours, right?
Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-1
06:43:38.146 --> 06:43:40.879
<v Ricky Horton>So if you put the 30 hours in the
original estimated,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-2
06:43:40.879 --> 06:43:44.625
<v Ricky Horton>can you can you add that's right?
Because that's got to say you can't add</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-3
06:43:44.625 --> 06:43:47.561
<v Ricky Horton>the hours today.
If you can add the hours in the original</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-4
06:43:47.561 --> 06:43:50.547
<v Ricky Horton>estimated, yeah,
put in 30 right there and then get rid of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36654-5
06:43:50.547 --> 06:43:51.357
<v Ricky Horton>your adjustment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-0
06:43:51.797 --> 06:43:55.024
<v Ricky Horton>So, so to summarize,
so the original estimate would be so from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-1
06:43:55.024 --> 06:43:59.071
<v Ricky Horton>the PC form, right. So we'd say, hey guys,
this is what we budgeted, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-2
06:43:59.071 --> 06:44:02.401
<v Ricky Horton>so that that's just so adjustment doesn't
even need to be there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-3
06:44:02.401 --> 06:44:06.295
<v Ricky Horton>We'll just throw in the original
estimated out there or the original, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-4
06:44:06.295 --> 06:44:09.983
<v Ricky Horton>into the estimated hour column.
It doesn't and then it'll take whatever</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36714-5
06:44:09.983 --> 06:44:10.957
<v Ricky Horton>the base hours are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36755-0
06:44:11.397 --> 06:44:15.094
<v Ricky Horton>And figure out where to find where it
should be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36755-1
06:44:15.094 --> 06:44:21.357
<v Ricky Horton>Now what you'll need to watch for though
is let's say that that was 100% that that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36755-2
06:44:21.357 --> 06:44:27.695
<v Ricky Horton>particular lot was 100% released and you
have this situation where original are 30,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36755-3
06:44:27.695 --> 06:44:31.317
<v Ricky Horton>but the base is saying you really only
have 69.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36793-0
06:44:31.517 --> 06:44:34.690
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, that's all that's coming, right?
Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36793-1
06:44:34.690 --> 06:44:39.377
<v Ricky Horton>it's still a plan 30 year because it's it
thinks more is coming.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36793-2
06:44:39.377 --> 06:44:45.290
<v Ricky Horton>So if you change the 100% release to 100%
then it would use the base hours of 16.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36793-3
06:44:45.290 --> 06:44:47.237
<v Ricky Horton>You follow what I'm saying?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36836-0
06:44:47.317 --> 06:44:52.810
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what we want to do. We want to,
we want to be managing to the actual to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36836-1
06:44:52.810 --> 06:44:57.641
<v Ricky Horton>what the work that we're saying can
happen and and using essentially the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36836-2
06:44:57.641 --> 06:45:03.200
<v Ricky Horton>knowledge of the original being at 30 to
know that you got 14 hours of contingency.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36836-3
06:45:03.200 --> 06:45:07.237
<v Ricky Horton>So I saw it show that it's 100% released
if we put 11 there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36846-0
06:45:07.237 --> 06:45:11.896
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
put it in below the area and get rid of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36846-1
06:45:11.896 --> 06:45:13.517
<v Ricky Horton>your adjustment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36850-0
06:45:15.157 --> 06:45:17.757
<v Ricky Horton>That's basically what we want to base
hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36893-0
06:45:22.677 --> 06:45:25.996
<v Ricky Horton>CS use them. Well,
it still thinks more is coming,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36893-1
06:45:25.996 --> 06:45:30.356
<v Ricky Horton>but if you change your percent release to
100, reasonable percent,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36893-2
06:45:30.356 --> 06:45:34.131
<v Ricky Horton>it calculates the percent release based
off of the hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36893-3
06:45:34.131 --> 06:45:39.077
<v Ricky Horton>So it changed with that because 54.
55% of the hours are actually released.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36904-0
06:45:39.637 --> 06:45:43.122
<v Ricky Horton>But if you change the percent release to
100,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36904-1
06:45:43.122 --> 06:45:46.077
<v Ricky Horton>it would put your planned hours at six.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36927-0
06:45:50.437 --> 06:45:52.759
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
it seems like it's adjusting it for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36927-1
06:45:52.759 --> 06:45:55.358
<v Ricky Horton>whatever we put in your original.
It is right,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36927-2
06:45:55.358 --> 06:45:57.957
<v Ricky Horton>but if you change it to 100 then it'll
adjust.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36932-0
06:46:00.157 --> 06:46:02.197
<v Ricky Horton>Who's the source of the original estimate?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36941-0
06:46:03.157 --> 06:46:09.477
<v Ricky Horton>We got a guy with a dartboard in Dilbert,
right? That's the that's the data, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36978-0
06:46:10.957 --> 06:46:16.822
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, so yeah, so I would,
I mean and I guess it's probably a hard</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36978-1
06:46:16.822 --> 06:46:23.525
<v Ricky Horton>decision, but to leverage this correctly,
I would say you would want to to take</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/36978-2
06:46:23.525 --> 06:46:26.877
<v Ricky Horton>whatever your base hours came out to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37018-0
06:46:27.317 --> 06:46:32.516
<v Ricky Horton>You would duplicate that into your
original estimate number so that you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37018-1
06:46:32.516 --> 06:46:38.437
<v Ricky Horton>could manage your percent released based
off of your base hours that your updated</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37018-2
06:46:38.437 --> 06:46:43.997
<v Ricky Horton>Rev zeros or can we check our percent
utilized because like look at this so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-0
06:46:44.837 --> 06:46:48.157
<v Ricky Horton>We're showing 16 hours and now I'm
showing that I went over,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-1
06:46:48.157 --> 06:46:51.423
<v Ricky Horton>but in reality on this line I don't think
I should do that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-2
06:46:51.423 --> 06:46:55.125
<v Ricky Horton>but that's what I'm saying.
So the base hours original estimate now</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-3
06:46:55.125 --> 06:46:58.881
<v Ricky Horton>should match and then Mark should just
know that his actual release.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-4
06:46:58.881 --> 06:47:01.984
<v Ricky Horton>So when he does,
when when we have our actual production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37073-5
06:47:01.984 --> 06:47:04.597
<v Ricky Horton>meetings and he brings us out,
he's gonna have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37119-0
06:47:04.717 --> 06:47:09.570
<v Ricky Horton>A separate column of what was actually
estimated on this side that's showing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37119-1
06:47:09.570 --> 06:47:13.163
<v Ricky Horton>that category.
You're saying base hours need to line up?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37119-2
06:47:13.163 --> 06:47:16.818
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, I think so.
So do we need to adjust all of it across</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37119-3
06:47:16.818 --> 06:47:20.474
<v Ricky Horton>the? I don't see you,
but base hours changes, doesn't it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37119-4
06:47:20.474 --> 06:47:23.437
<v Ricky Horton>Base hours will change based off based
off of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37175-0
06:47:23.797 --> 06:47:28.014
<v Ricky Horton>Imported more pieces, yes.
So if we bring in more pieces,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37175-1
06:47:28.014 --> 06:47:33.613
<v Ricky Horton>then it's going to change that base.
But then the estimate is there. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37175-2
06:47:33.613 --> 06:47:37.758
<v Ricky Horton>but if we leave,
if we if we bring in more pieces but we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37175-3
06:47:37.758 --> 06:47:43.357
<v Ricky Horton>sequence a lot into a separate sequence,
well, it's just that same sequence.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37214-0
06:47:43.917 --> 06:47:48.754
<v Ricky Horton>So we bring in more pieces, right? Yeah.
We do another thing for for this or no</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37214-1
06:47:48.754 --> 06:47:52.926
<v Ricky Horton>for a separate sequence. Yeah.
Will it affect this sequence? No. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37214-2
06:47:52.926 --> 06:47:57.642
<v Ricky Horton>so if we change it across the board, yeah.
So as long as base hours match the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37214-3
06:47:57.642 --> 06:47:59.517
<v Ricky Horton>original estimate, then you're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37258-0
06:47:59.877 --> 06:48:03.842
<v Ricky Horton>Percent release here,
percent completes are all flow through</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37258-1
06:48:03.842 --> 06:48:06.962
<v Ricky Horton>well.
So as long as as long as the PDS that are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37258-2
06:48:06.962 --> 06:48:12.292
<v Ricky Horton>releasing this stuff are giving you guys
the hours for that sequence and lot then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37258-3
06:48:12.292 --> 06:48:15.477
<v Ricky Horton>and you guys know that then that this
works but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37307-0
06:48:15.877 --> 06:48:18.863
<v Ricky Horton>In a situation where it's like a,
you know, hey,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37307-1
06:48:18.863 --> 06:48:23.069
<v Ricky Horton>this is one out of three canopies,
here's your guys' overall budget,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37307-2
06:48:23.069 --> 06:48:27.153
<v Ricky Horton>then we'll just have to,
we'll just have to make sure that we hold</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37307-3
06:48:27.153 --> 06:48:31.907
<v Ricky Horton>them accountable and then and then Mark
just needs to know that he's managing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37307-4
06:48:31.907 --> 06:48:33.797
<v Ricky Horton>those, those buckets are clear.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37343-0
06:48:33.877 --> 06:48:39.077
<v Ricky Horton>Well, what what Mark reestimates.
So let's say Mark gets something from</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37343-1
06:48:39.077 --> 06:48:44.423
<v Ricky Horton>Gilbert. He's like, well, yeah,
it's not this, he says. It's really this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37343-2
06:48:44.423 --> 06:48:48.757
<v Ricky Horton>Where does that? Where does that go?
It's technically what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37383-0
06:48:49.397 --> 06:48:54.356
<v Ricky Horton>Your base hours and Jesus, right,
'cause that's where it's being</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37383-1
06:48:54.356 --> 06:49:00.536
<v Ricky Horton>reestimated and that's your base hours.
So the idea of that by doing it this way</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37383-2
06:49:00.536 --> 06:49:06.717
<v Ricky Horton>through when we start a job or even touch
the shot, we can have a discussion of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37427-0
06:49:06.997 --> 06:49:11.327
<v Ricky Horton>We're planning to pay for a budget and we
can at least go into it saying OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37427-1
06:49:11.327 --> 06:49:14.363
<v Ricky Horton>what changed?
Can we get a change or ingest something</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37427-2
06:49:14.363 --> 06:49:19.087
<v Ricky Horton>or is it just something that we just know
that we just need to treat this as it has</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37427-3
06:49:19.087 --> 06:49:23.473
<v Ricky Horton>to be just production based so like
everything has to be perfect and only get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37427-4
06:49:23.473 --> 06:49:26.397
<v Ricky Horton>the guys who want the work doesn't really
get done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37461-0
06:49:26.597 --> 06:49:34.684
<v Ricky Horton>Four hours and that's it. So you're in.
I also think that as long as I'm</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37461-1
06:49:34.684 --> 06:49:42.439
<v Ricky Horton>searching where I think it's on the
subjective stuff, right? I'm not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37461-2
06:49:42.439 --> 06:49:46.317
<v Ricky Horton>That's not coming in with based on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37478-0
06:49:46.517 --> 06:49:55.397
<v Ricky Horton>I'm hearing two conversations here.
I'm having the hard time keeping track.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37514-0
06:49:57.477 --> 06:50:01.618
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's really important that we
agree on what this is because we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37514-1
06:50:01.618 --> 06:50:05.088
<v Ricky Horton>having two separate.
He and I are having a discussion and you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37514-2
06:50:05.088 --> 06:50:09.062
<v Ricky Horton>guys are having a discussion,
but I think it's what is the real answer</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37514-3
06:50:09.062 --> 06:50:10.517
<v Ricky Horton>of how to do this because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37556-0
06:50:11.597 --> 06:50:17.014
<v Ricky Horton>Alan is right that that 175 being
calculated between 2 numbers and you're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37556-1
06:50:17.014 --> 06:50:22.870
<v Ricky Horton>trying to avoid that from happening.
But you know what's your what's your goal?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37556-2
06:50:22.870 --> 06:50:28.653
<v Ricky Horton>So now so now what we really need to do
though right knowing this is it's just</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37556-3
06:50:28.653 --> 06:50:30.117
<v Ricky Horton>change the 16 to 30.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37562-0
06:50:31.397 --> 06:50:34.917
<v Ricky Horton>In the plan in our base.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37616-0
06:50:36.117 --> 06:50:39.092
<v Ricky Horton>Right. Well,
it's great if the estimator actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37616-1
06:50:39.092 --> 06:50:42.009
<v Ricky Horton>estimated 30,
but we've seen some jobs where the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37616-2
06:50:42.009 --> 06:50:45.580
<v Ricky Horton>estimator estimated 14,
but it it it will change based upon</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37616-3
06:50:45.580 --> 06:50:49.091
<v Ricky Horton>whatever we're given, right?
If we're only given 14 hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37616-4
06:50:49.091 --> 06:50:53.317
<v Ricky Horton>that's where we're we're adding these
original estimated hours, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37666-0
06:50:53.437 --> 06:50:56.062
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that's what looked like has been</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37666-1
06:50:56.062 --> 06:51:00.842
<v Ricky Horton>happening, right? Mark says,
I don't think so and he's making a so and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37666-2
06:51:00.842 --> 06:51:04.005
<v Ricky Horton>it seems like it's a slippery.
So on one side,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37666-3
06:51:04.005 --> 06:51:09.122
<v Ricky Horton>if base hours are coming in less than
original, right, that's great, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37666-4
06:51:09.122 --> 06:51:12.757
<v Ricky Horton>But you want Mark to plan his production
accordingly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37703-0
06:51:12.837 --> 06:51:15.526
<v Ricky Horton>And we're talking bigger intelligence,
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37703-1
06:51:15.526 --> 06:51:20.204
<v Ricky Horton>But you don't want Mark to to still on
budget his hours based off of, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37703-2
06:51:20.204 --> 06:51:24.941
<v Ricky Horton>having 10 guys busy versus the base hours
saying you're only going to keep three</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37703-3
06:51:24.941 --> 06:51:28.332
<v Ricky Horton>guys busy, right?
I think we need to show the data you've</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37703-4
06:51:28.332 --> 06:51:28.917
<v Ricky Horton>collected.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37753-0
06:51:29.157 --> 06:51:34.408
<v Ricky Horton>For the few jobs and show estimated base,
show what's really happening and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37753-1
06:51:34.408 --> 06:51:39.726
<v Ricky Horton>everybody kind of looks at what's really
going on and then have that discussion.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37753-2
06:51:39.726 --> 06:51:43.008
<v Ricky Horton>And it's yeah,
we've been like even pulling data,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37753-3
06:51:43.008 --> 06:51:46.422
<v Ricky Horton>we've been pulling data just to kind of
look at it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37753-4
06:51:46.422 --> 06:51:48.917
<v Ricky Horton>So and but I guess the base hours are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37795-0
06:51:48.917 --> 06:51:54.126
<v Ricky Horton>We're talking aren't pulling in true well
hours, right. So it's just a well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37795-1
06:51:54.126 --> 06:51:58.861
<v Ricky Horton>it's it depends on how you do it.
So theoretically original estimate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37795-2
06:51:58.861 --> 06:52:02.649
<v Ricky Horton>original estimate,
that's what we have on the estimate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37795-3
06:52:02.649 --> 06:52:05.694
<v Ricky Horton>right.
Base hours is saying this is what you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37795-4
06:52:05.694 --> 06:52:08.197
<v Ricky Horton>actually are going to be working for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37827-0
06:52:08.597 --> 06:52:14.299
<v Ricky Horton>For what's for what's out there.
So if base hours is accurate,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37827-1
06:52:14.299 --> 06:52:21.721
<v Ricky Horton>I want that utilization to show you that
way over because if I literally did have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37827-2
06:52:21.721 --> 06:52:26.157
<v Ricky Horton>16 hours of work in that at least instead
of 30.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37860-0
06:52:26.677 --> 06:52:31.471
<v Ricky Horton>Then I want it to be 16 and that's what
I'll be judged on. It's the 16,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37860-1
06:52:31.471 --> 06:52:35.067
<v Ricky Horton>not the 30.
Now it's good information that it's like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37860-2
06:52:35.067 --> 06:52:38.397
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool, good.
Even though I might be a 28, I'm.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37890-0
06:52:39.917 --> 06:52:43.780
<v Ricky Horton>Under this late hours. That's awesome.
That's great work under.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37890-1
06:52:43.780 --> 06:52:48.489
<v Ricky Horton>But did I actually be mad because it was
really 16 hours of work that took 28</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37890-2
06:52:48.489 --> 06:52:51.386
<v Ricky Horton>hours, right?
So if the base hours are correct,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37890-3
06:52:51.386 --> 06:52:53.077
<v Ricky Horton>then I want it to show that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37941-0
06:52:55.717 --> 06:53:00.017
<v Ricky Horton>You know what I'm saying, right?
So then it's a constant tweak to get the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37941-1
06:53:00.017 --> 06:53:04.142
<v Ricky Horton>base hours as close to what our hours
that we're actually producing it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37941-2
06:53:04.142 --> 06:53:07.455
<v Ricky Horton>correctly. Yeah,
it might be not there because let's say</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37941-3
06:53:07.455 --> 06:53:12.045
<v Ricky Horton>on the estimate there were there were
three columns in there and now I've only</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37941-4
06:53:12.045 --> 06:53:12.917
<v Ricky Horton>got one column.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-0
06:53:13.157 --> 06:53:16.263
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want the base hours to be 30
hours. No, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-1
06:53:16.263 --> 06:53:18.958
<v Ricky Horton>What I'm saying is,
is what I want is the base hours to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-2
06:53:18.958 --> 06:53:22.842
<v Ricky Horton>what what we're actually going to produce
it at. Yeah, yeah. So if it says 16 hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-3
06:53:22.842 --> 06:53:25.217
<v Ricky Horton>we should be producing it at 16 hours,
right? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-4
06:53:25.217 --> 06:53:28.461
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're we're shooting for.
It's regardless of the estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/37994-5
06:53:28.461 --> 06:53:30.197
<v Ricky Horton>If they gave us 30 hours, that's cool.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38037-0
06:53:30.477 --> 06:53:34.296
<v Ricky Horton>But we should only need 16. Yeah.
And that's what you should manage for is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38037-1
06:53:34.296 --> 06:53:38.522
<v Ricky Horton>what at the end of the day, I think the,
but then the biggest thing is making sure</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38037-2
06:53:38.522 --> 06:53:42.596
<v Ricky Horton>that we're getting good data back, right.
But then the way we've been utilizing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38037-3
06:53:42.596 --> 06:53:45.957
<v Ricky Horton>this is, is wrong, right.
If it's what it's going to look at now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38080-0
06:53:46.517 --> 06:53:52.805
<v Ricky Horton>Is the hours that were planned, right?
So the base hours of the plan are you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38080-1
06:53:52.805 --> 06:53:57.950
<v Ricky Horton>guys give the shot before they're done,
is that correct? Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38080-2
06:53:57.950 --> 06:54:03.993
<v Ricky Horton>originally it was the adjustment,
which is to adjust the hours to fit and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38080-3
06:54:03.993 --> 06:54:06.117
<v Ricky Horton>then that would bring the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38110-0
06:54:06.197 --> 06:54:09.785
<v Ricky Horton>Or so, right. So if it was 16 hours,
we have 30,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38110-1
06:54:09.785 --> 06:54:15.350
<v Ricky Horton>we would add to that 16 to get the 30 in
the planned hours. But base hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38110-2
06:54:15.350 --> 06:54:19.597
<v Ricky Horton>assuming 100% release, uh,
base hours should match plans.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38154-0
06:54:21.037 --> 06:54:24.247
<v Ricky Horton>If if all material is for apples to
apples, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38154-1
06:54:24.247 --> 06:54:29.385
<v Ricky Horton>So if he changes base hours right now
since it says at 100 like change which it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38154-2
06:54:29.385 --> 06:54:33.366
<v Ricky Horton>already shows 66 right?
But if final I guess that does if you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38154-3
06:54:33.366 --> 06:54:37.797
<v Ricky Horton>change it to 31, see if it changes,
but it should change it to plan.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38156-0
06:54:38.117 --> 06:54:39.117
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38197-0
06:54:40.717 --> 06:54:46.035
<v Ricky Horton>Now here's here's the game there. What?
If you do nothing but just connect the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38197-1
06:54:46.035 --> 06:54:48.795
<v Ricky Horton>two,
let's say that hours per ton of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38197-2
06:54:48.795 --> 06:54:52.835
<v Ricky Horton>estimate was 9 hours of time, right?
I got 9 hours of time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38197-3
06:54:52.835 --> 06:54:55.797
<v Ricky Horton>That's what it's going to apply over
there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38240-0
06:54:55.957 --> 06:55:01.922
<v Ricky Horton>But let's say that this release had some
stuff that was 25 hours a ton in in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38240-1
06:55:01.922 --> 06:55:06.415
<v Ricky Horton>reality, because it's higher.
Let's let's say it's rails.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38240-2
06:55:06.415 --> 06:55:09.978
<v Ricky Horton>They're gonna be higher hours per ton,
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38240-3
06:55:09.978 --> 06:55:14.317
<v Ricky Horton>And some of the stuff in the release was
4 hours a ton.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38279-0
06:55:15.557 --> 06:55:19.901
<v Ricky Horton>Because they're just filler beads and
there's given holes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38279-1
06:55:19.901 --> 06:55:25.571
<v Ricky Horton>So that base hours may be wacked out
because I'm applying none when I should</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38279-2
06:55:25.571 --> 06:55:31.094
<v Ricky Horton>be applying 25 hours a ton for that
particular type of work that's in that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38279-3
06:55:31.094 --> 06:55:31.757
<v Ricky Horton>sequence.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38326-0
06:55:31.957 --> 06:55:36.373
<v Ricky Horton>So there is a way to do it by this way.
It's going to create more work there</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38326-1
06:55:36.373 --> 06:55:40.789
<v Ricky Horton>because the estimate's going to have to
use predict what's called production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38326-2
06:55:40.789 --> 06:55:43.083
<v Ricky Horton>codes,
which says I'll just call this a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38326-3
06:55:43.083 --> 06:55:47.557
<v Ricky Horton>production code of rails and I'll call
this a production code of filler beam.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38370-0
06:55:47.597 --> 06:55:53.131
<v Ricky Horton>And so now pieces in the estimate are
going to have to be designated as part of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38370-1
06:55:53.131 --> 06:55:57.490
<v Ricky Horton>rails or Philippines,
and the pieces in production control are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38370-2
06:55:57.490 --> 06:56:02.402
<v Ricky Horton>going to be designated as rails or
Philippines in order to apply these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38370-3
06:56:02.402 --> 06:56:06.277
<v Ricky Horton>separately instead of just the overall
average of none.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38408-0
06:56:06.477 --> 06:56:13.820
<v Ricky Horton>So the same companies doing it that way.
A lot of companies go this route because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38408-1
06:56:13.820 --> 06:56:19.372
<v Ricky Horton>of this logic here.
What most of them end up coming back here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38408-2
06:56:19.372 --> 06:56:24.477
<v Ricky Horton>because this is that's a constant fight
back to do that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38421-0
06:56:24.957 --> 06:56:27.951
<v Ricky Horton>But your releases are very similar to
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38421-1
06:56:27.951 --> 06:56:31.477
<v Ricky Horton>Your releases are columns or you mix work
like that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38458-0
06:56:32.877 --> 06:56:37.098
<v Ricky Horton>Rails and beams. No,
the stairs will be with rails, but that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38458-1
06:56:37.098 --> 06:56:41.056
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, you know,
columns will be with beams, but it's not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38458-2
06:56:41.056 --> 06:56:45.146
<v Ricky Horton>But you're still talking about an overall
one project, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38458-3
06:56:45.146 --> 06:56:47.917
<v Ricky Horton>You're not talking about several releases.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38508-0
06:56:48.277 --> 06:56:51.468
<v Ricky Horton>But it doesn't,
but it it is talking about specific</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38508-1
06:56:51.468 --> 06:56:54.414
<v Ricky Horton>releases.
So if for now it's over the way we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38508-2
06:56:54.414 --> 06:56:58.955
<v Ricky Horton>doing it now, but if we detail,
if we just make sure we detail everything</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38508-3
06:56:58.955 --> 06:57:03.497
<v Ricky Horton>out based off of a full rail package,
yeah, being packaged, we don't mix,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38508-4
06:57:03.497 --> 06:57:05.277
<v Ricky Horton>we don't need to it changing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38552-0
06:57:05.477 --> 06:57:07.931
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but if we're if we're doing rails with</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38552-1
06:57:07.931 --> 06:57:11.966
<v Ricky Horton>beams, then we need to understand.
So technically we would need to detail</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38552-2
06:57:11.966 --> 06:57:14.693
<v Ricky Horton>them separately.
You guys can just assign them to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38552-3
06:57:14.693 --> 06:57:18.946
<v Ricky Horton>different sequence of plots from the
import and then you can bypass having to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38552-4
06:57:18.946 --> 06:57:20.037
<v Ricky Horton>keep them separated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38607-0
06:57:20.877 --> 06:57:25.609
<v Ricky Horton>So you guys are just organizing the way
that you actually would produce them in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38607-1
06:57:25.609 --> 06:57:29.809
<v Ricky Horton>the shop, right? So you say, OK,
like I want to mark when you go to to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38607-2
06:57:29.809 --> 06:57:32.884
<v Ricky Horton>actually manpower load the the project
and say, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38607-3
06:57:32.884 --> 06:57:37.794
<v Ricky Horton>we need to call them all out first, right?
So you break that columns into sequence</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38607-4
06:57:37.794 --> 06:57:40.397
<v Ricky Horton>mod and then he's gonna get his own
unique.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38643-0
06:57:40.477 --> 06:57:43.737
<v Ricky Horton>Hours per time for that set of calls,
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38643-1
06:57:43.737 --> 06:57:46.997
<v Ricky Horton>And then you can plan it working from
there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38643-2
06:57:46.997 --> 06:57:51.996
<v Ricky Horton>But where that's going to be hard to
manage into the overall budget,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38643-3
06:57:51.996 --> 06:57:56.995
<v Ricky Horton>the shovel was up last week.
They weren't going to try to fight that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38643-4
06:57:56.995 --> 06:57:58.517
<v Ricky Horton>panel too discreetly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38672-0
06:57:58.877 --> 06:58:04.927
<v Ricky Horton>Or two, what they ended up,
what they will start at with is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38672-1
06:58:04.927 --> 06:58:12.491
<v Ricky Horton>structural versus miscellaneous. Yeah,
two different ones, which would be,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38672-2
06:58:12.491 --> 06:58:13.197
<v Ricky Horton>I mean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38678-0
06:58:14.117 --> 06:58:14.997
<v Ricky Horton>It's not very well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38682-0
06:58:16.237 --> 06:58:18.677
<v Ricky Horton>One package, typically add X.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38739-0
06:58:19.837 --> 06:58:23.680
<v Ricky Horton>They've already been separated.
I mean it's not it's events.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38739-1
06:58:23.680 --> 06:58:27.964
<v Ricky Horton>It's in for 0758 we have.
I mean there's definitely there's there's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38739-2
06:58:27.964 --> 06:58:31.681
<v Ricky Horton>annual braces and then there were study
palms, but it was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38739-3
06:58:31.681 --> 06:58:35.839
<v Ricky Horton>So if we really go from stairs,
but if we real if we give it as a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38739-4
06:58:35.839 --> 06:58:39.557
<v Ricky Horton>sequence of and then block that out
though as far as like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38775-0
06:58:39.637 --> 06:58:44.701
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool. The the WTS are their own line,
but it's still within the same sequence.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38775-1
06:58:44.701 --> 06:58:47.813
<v Ricky Horton>It depends. Yeah,
all the correct hour paper time,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38775-2
06:58:47.813 --> 06:58:52.634
<v Ricky Horton>but the way that we if you don't use
production page is the way it's the same,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38775-3
06:58:52.634 --> 06:58:55.197
<v Ricky Horton>but it would do it per sequence and block.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38796-0
06:58:55.197 --> 06:58:58.608
<v Ricky Horton>Mm-hmm.
But based off of the way that we estimate</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38796-1
06:58:58.608 --> 06:59:01.611
<v Ricky Horton>LG,
we estimated it based off of it being a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38796-2
06:59:01.611 --> 06:59:04.477
<v Ricky Horton>structural job, right? So like, we're not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38838-0
06:59:06.237 --> 06:59:10.708
<v Ricky Horton>So that's at least. Yeah, we're, I mean,
they're rolled out to gut check your</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38838-1
06:59:10.708 --> 06:59:14.778
<v Ricky Horton>management on the overall project,
but the way prompts really, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38838-2
06:59:14.778 --> 06:59:17.415
<v Ricky Horton>he's taking it off as each one of the
pieces,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38838-3
06:59:17.415 --> 06:59:20.338
<v Ricky Horton>but you're not gonna manage everything
separately.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38838-4
06:59:20.338 --> 06:59:22.517
<v Ricky Horton>It's you're different hours like that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38877-0
06:59:22.717 --> 06:59:27.141
<v Ricky Horton>I would say this would be more like lucid
to where it's overall this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38877-1
06:59:27.141 --> 06:59:31.440
<v Ricky Horton>This would be best on miss smells.
I think it's the better you keep</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38877-2
06:59:31.440 --> 06:59:35.928
<v Ricky Horton>structural miss smells like you were
saying separate and then we could</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38877-3
06:59:35.928 --> 06:59:38.077
<v Ricky Horton>separate out miss smells based on.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38912-0
06:59:38.117 --> 06:59:41.348
<v Ricky Horton>Rails,
stairs and strainers and we might have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38912-1
06:59:41.348 --> 06:59:46.475
<v Ricky Horton>seen it on this one by two because not
necessarily there may not be less</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38912-2
06:59:46.475 --> 06:59:49.987
<v Ricky Horton>material,
but it or for that disparity like I was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38912-3
06:59:49.987 --> 06:59:52.797
<v Ricky Horton>talking about, but it could be that the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38966-0
06:59:53.277 --> 06:59:56.880
<v Ricky Horton>Estimate just getting that right stuff in,
right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38966-1
06:59:56.880 --> 07:00:01.275
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe it wasn't leaving out properly or
something like that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38966-2
07:00:01.275 --> 07:00:04.662
<v Ricky Horton>So most stops that get into the overall
hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38966-3
07:00:04.662 --> 07:00:09.850
<v Ricky Horton>but then in most cases for structural in
general, they're pretty close.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/38966-4
07:00:09.850 --> 07:00:12.517
<v Ricky Horton>Now you know it's fine, you know, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39002-0
07:00:12.877 --> 07:00:17.768
<v Ricky Horton>Based on hours instead of adjusted.
That's what we need to be putting this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39002-1
07:00:17.768 --> 07:00:22.594
<v Ricky Horton>right more than putting them under
adjusted out of adjusted, right. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39002-2
07:00:22.594 --> 07:00:26.050
<v Ricky Horton>we spoke up.
So I didn't have this column activated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39002-3
07:00:26.050 --> 07:00:29.637
<v Ricky Horton>So originally it was, yeah,
based on hours adjustment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39010-0
07:00:29.757 --> 07:00:32.997
<v Ricky Horton>And then it should be original and base
hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39051-0
07:00:33.837 --> 07:00:36.809
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
what would the adjusted be used for in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39051-1
07:00:36.809 --> 07:00:40.574
<v Ricky Horton>the long run then if it was just used
original and base.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39051-2
07:00:40.574 --> 07:00:45.395
<v Ricky Horton>So we use base hours and adjustment and
then worked out the final hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39051-3
07:00:45.395 --> 07:00:49.557
<v Ricky Horton>So our PC form would have these total
quantities of hours and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39086-0
07:00:49.917 --> 07:00:56.532
<v Ricky Horton>And then this is our utilization with the
utilization is coming so close and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39086-1
07:00:56.532 --> 07:01:03.319
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments up to regular hours and you
you that will give a new flavor to the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39086-2
07:01:03.319 --> 07:01:07.357
<v Ricky Horton>utilization per se for sure,
but it will also.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39128-0
07:01:07.637 --> 07:01:10.826
<v Ricky Horton>Help you on the opposite scenario where
the hours act,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39128-1
07:01:10.826 --> 07:01:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>the base hours actually come out more
than the original estimated. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39128-2
07:01:15.060 --> 07:01:18.539
<v Ricky Horton>that's going to make you look better
because it's like, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39128-3
07:01:18.539 --> 07:01:22.715
<v Ricky Horton>well we should that utilization should be
based off of a higher number,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39128-4
07:01:22.715 --> 07:01:24.397
<v Ricky Horton>not the estimated number, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39144-0
07:01:24.477 --> 07:01:27.336
<v Ricky Horton>It just makes it look bad when that when
that number splits.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39144-1
07:01:27.336 --> 07:01:30.477
<v Ricky Horton>Were you guys getting beat up because
those numbers were going on?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39185-0
07:01:31.997 --> 07:01:40.507
<v Ricky Horton>That'd probably be more question for Mark
for specifically for LG or in general.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39185-1
07:01:40.507 --> 07:01:47.756
<v Ricky Horton>So I wouldn't say beat up,
it's just the it's the common fight of of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39185-2
07:01:47.756 --> 07:01:49.437
<v Ricky Horton>estimate versus.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39239-0
07:01:50.237 --> 07:01:54.241
<v Ricky Horton>Production, right.
Estimators always trying to do things one</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39239-1
07:01:54.241 --> 07:01:59.493
<v Ricky Horton>way and production always sharing them.
So it's the it's making sure that we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39239-2
07:01:59.493 --> 07:02:04.417
<v Ricky Horton>on the same page to me on when the
project's kicked off so that we know do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39239-3
07:02:04.417 --> 07:02:09.734
<v Ricky Horton>we need to really pay attention to this
and come up with a way to make this into</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39239-4
07:02:09.734 --> 07:02:09.997
<v Ricky Horton>a a.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39280-0
07:02:10.157 --> 07:02:14.284
<v Ricky Horton>We can or did we miss something?
At least establish what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39280-1
07:02:14.284 --> 07:02:20.262
<v Ricky Horton>Is your main is angle main goal is a goal
to make sure the Gilbert guys are getting</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39280-2
07:02:20.262 --> 07:02:24.532
<v Ricky Horton>the Gilbert estimators are hitting the
numbers really well?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39280-3
07:02:24.532 --> 07:02:27.237
<v Ricky Horton>Or is it your goal that Mark fixes it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39339-0
07:02:27.797 --> 07:02:32.974
<v Ricky Horton>And Mark's numbers are really good.
I think the the the main goal here to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39339-1
07:02:32.974 --> 07:02:38.291
<v Ricky Horton>make a lot is OK, well, I get that.
The main goal is to if everyone's using</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39339-2
07:02:38.291 --> 07:02:43.049
<v Ricky Horton>the estimate in techo, right.
So all the hours are based off of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39339-3
07:02:43.049 --> 07:02:46.477
<v Ricky Horton>unit rates and and the the math that's
designed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39392-0
07:02:47.277 --> 07:02:51.152
<v Ricky Horton>Into this, right.
So I think the main goal is to get that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39392-1
07:02:51.152 --> 07:02:54.694
<v Ricky Horton>as accurate as possible to where we are
established,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39392-2
07:02:54.694 --> 07:03:00.039
<v Ricky Horton>is it a bad take off or is it or is it a
unit rate of something that we need to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39392-3
07:03:00.039 --> 07:03:03.380
<v Ricky Horton>fix, right.
And I think that's where the argument</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39392-4
07:03:03.380 --> 07:03:04.717
<v Ricky Horton>needs to come in is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39436-0
07:03:05.037 --> 07:03:09.584
<v Ricky Horton>Is is it it's a take off thing then
that's I mean that's a simple thing to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39436-1
07:03:09.584 --> 07:03:14.192
<v Ricky Horton>say OK you it's clearly there's four
columns and you know you only have two</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39436-2
07:03:14.192 --> 07:03:17.042
<v Ricky Horton>right.
But if we're trending constantly like I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39436-3
07:03:17.042 --> 07:03:21.711
<v Ricky Horton>saw is producing at half the rate that
we're actually estimating to that's a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39436-4
07:03:21.711 --> 07:03:24.197
<v Ricky Horton>global thing that makes you address with.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39479-0
07:03:24.597 --> 07:03:28.913
<v Ricky Horton>New equipment maintenance.
When you guys first get a job and you go</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39479-1
07:03:28.913 --> 07:03:33.611
<v Ricky Horton>and you know what the original estimate
is before you put it in the show,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39479-2
07:03:33.611 --> 07:03:38.118
<v Ricky Horton>somebody looks at it and says no,
this estimate over here is 12 hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39479-3
07:03:38.118 --> 07:03:42.117
<v Ricky Horton>It's supposed to be 16 and maybe the next
time out of balance.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39493-0
07:03:42.317 --> 07:03:47.203
<v Ricky Horton>Supposed to be 16 and we really only
think it's going to be 12 and that's what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39493-1
07:03:47.203 --> 07:03:49.677
<v Ricky Horton>base column should be used for, correct?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39550-0
07:03:51.957 --> 07:03:55.542
<v Ricky Horton>No, it it it basically does.
It basically does that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39550-1
07:03:55.542 --> 07:04:00.682
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody has to look at it and do it.
It calculates it automatically based on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39550-2
07:04:00.682 --> 07:04:06.026
<v Ricky Horton>the times that we have set up in for
welding and cutting and all that it it it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39550-3
07:04:06.026 --> 07:04:08.934
<v Ricky Horton>does,
but it it takes the average from the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39550-4
07:04:08.934 --> 07:04:11.437
<v Ricky Horton>estimate. It takes the, it takes the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39603-0
07:04:11.437 --> 07:04:15.469
<v Ricky Horton>Total hours have to have to go to the
base for a time, the total.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39603-1
07:04:15.469 --> 07:04:20.417
<v Ricky Horton>But another's working out too whether so
you don't have to enter everything into</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39603-2
07:04:20.417 --> 07:04:25.427
<v Ricky Horton>the base that's can be documented already.
If you enter something into the guest,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39603-3
07:04:25.427 --> 07:04:27.749
<v Ricky Horton>right.
So I would say to even another</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39603-4
07:04:27.749 --> 07:04:30.437
<v Ricky Horton>perspective of what we're talking about
is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39666-0
07:04:30.557 --> 07:04:34.149
<v Ricky Horton>This is going to get us,
let's just say to a 90% mark, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39666-1
07:04:34.149 --> 07:04:38.785
<v Ricky Horton>And within that estimate you're doing
frame versus the structural and this base</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39666-2
07:04:38.785 --> 07:04:43.247
<v Ricky Horton>hours here is going to look at it and
generalize it as if it's the same main</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39666-3
07:04:43.247 --> 07:04:47.477
<v Ricky Horton>hours per time as the structural.
But you know it's a more complex frame</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39666-4
07:04:47.477 --> 07:04:50.317
<v Ricky Horton>system that's going to need more hours.
So Mark.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39696-0
07:04:50.437 --> 07:04:54.917
<v Ricky Horton>From the estimates and say,
I think we need to put a factor on top of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39696-1
07:04:54.917 --> 07:04:57.733
<v Ricky Horton>that.
Let's just add another 20 nanometers,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39696-2
07:04:57.733 --> 07:05:02.213
<v Ricky Horton>right. And I think that's it.
I think that's where you would add that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39696-3
07:05:02.213 --> 07:05:05.477
<v Ricky Horton>back end adjustment because the original
estimate.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39744-0
07:05:05.757 --> 07:05:09.662
<v Ricky Horton>Even though we have more hours,
Mark's actually saying that even though</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39744-1
07:05:09.662 --> 07:05:12.319
<v Ricky Horton>the base gets re-imported in as the lower
hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39744-2
07:05:12.319 --> 07:05:16.766
<v Ricky Horton>he's still thinking that we're going to
need the additional hours to be allocated</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39744-3
07:05:16.766 --> 07:05:19.315
<v Ricky Horton>to get it back up to there.
That's what we do,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39744-4
07:05:19.315 --> 07:05:20.997
<v Ricky Horton>which I think that's the point.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-0
07:05:21.197 --> 07:05:25.865
<v Ricky Horton>Let the program go from the original the
base hours and then if we think there's a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-1
07:05:25.865 --> 07:05:29.803
<v Ricky Horton>necessity to put in the adjustment,
that's what Mark would put in the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-2
07:05:29.803 --> 07:05:33.122
<v Ricky Horton>adjustment just like unit rates in a man
hour book, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-3
07:05:33.122 --> 07:05:37.847
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's saying that you know you're at
an 80% efficiency, but you add in and say,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-4
07:05:37.847 --> 07:05:40.209
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
I know the pipes 30 feet in air we're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39818-5
07:05:40.209 --> 07:05:40.997
<v Ricky Horton>going to need.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-0
07:05:41.037 --> 07:05:43.960
<v Ricky Horton>This, this and this,
you're gonna bring the guys back down.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-1
07:05:43.960 --> 07:05:46.541
<v Ricky Horton>And I think that's kind of what we're
talking about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-2
07:05:46.541 --> 07:05:50.293
<v Ricky Horton>The adjustment is to adjust our main
hours for time based off the complexity</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-3
07:05:50.293 --> 07:05:52.826
<v Ricky Horton>of the system that yeah,
technically it's in. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-4
07:05:52.826 --> 07:05:56.528
<v Ricky Horton>let's see what we have to do, right.
People use that adjustment for kind of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39872-5
07:05:56.528 --> 07:05:58.477
<v Ricky Horton>similar to what you're talking about or.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39914-0
07:05:58.517 --> 07:06:03.144
<v Ricky Horton>It's we had 75 hours of rework,
so I'll put that on there or there's a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39914-1
07:06:03.144 --> 07:06:08.163
<v Ricky Horton>change order and there's more hours.
Usually the adjustment is the exception</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39914-2
07:06:08.163 --> 07:06:13.311
<v Ricky Horton>and it's if there's anything adjustment,
there's always a question of why do I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39914-3
07:06:13.311 --> 07:06:17.157
<v Ricky Horton>have this year, but in my mind,
if there's a change order.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39962-0
07:06:17.557 --> 07:06:23.159
<v Ricky Horton>The original estimate is going to be
updated as well because you've estimated</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39962-1
07:06:23.159 --> 07:06:27.109
<v Ricky Horton>the change order and your base contract
has increased.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39962-2
07:06:27.109 --> 07:06:32.855
<v Ricky Horton>Some people want to keep that original
estimate here and that's why they put it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/39962-3
07:06:32.855 --> 07:06:37.237
<v Ricky Horton>in the sample. I get it.
I call it change order one January.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40004-0
07:06:37.237 --> 07:06:43.274
<v Ricky Horton>Or two, but they're still linked together.
But I think the factors that we were</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40004-1
07:06:43.274 --> 07:06:48.934
<v Ricky Horton>messing with in the global system,
we're trying to make the numbers mostly</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40004-2
07:06:48.934 --> 07:06:54.443
<v Ricky Horton>match what production was doing.
The problem that we're seeing is across</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40004-3
07:06:54.443 --> 07:06:55.877
<v Ricky Horton>three or four jobs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40037-0
07:06:56.757 --> 07:06:59.966
<v Ricky Horton>It wasn't. What's the right word? Linear,
right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40037-1
07:06:59.966 --> 07:07:04.813
<v Ricky Horton>So you'd think that it would be this
factor. Well, that matched this job,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40037-2
07:07:04.813 --> 07:07:08.678
<v Ricky Horton>but not that job.
So there's more going on here that meets</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40037-3
07:07:08.678 --> 07:07:11.757
<v Ricky Horton>the eye.
We probably need a bigger sample set.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40065-0
07:07:11.957 --> 07:07:17.826
<v Ricky Horton>Got to really figure out, you know,
what a 40 hour or 150 hour job is very</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40065-1
07:07:17.826 --> 07:07:23.148
<v Ricky Horton>different than a 4000 hour job.
There's some things happening here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40065-2
07:07:23.148 --> 07:07:28.157
<v Ricky Horton>but getting the global factors closer
will only help everybody.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40100-0
07:07:28.837 --> 07:07:34.522
<v Ricky Horton>I think honestly at this point you've got
to really take a look at what the actual</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40100-1
07:07:34.522 --> 07:07:40.140
<v Ricky Horton>is in order to adjust the rest of what's
in there because we're trying to compare</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40100-2
07:07:40.140 --> 07:07:45.140
<v Ricky Horton>it to what we said the budget was,
but I don't know that that's based on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40100-3
07:07:45.140 --> 07:07:45.757
<v Ricky Horton>anything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40107-0
07:07:47.077 --> 07:07:52.557
<v Ricky Horton>Um, dad driven is more gut driven,
which maybe.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40137-0
07:07:53.717 --> 07:07:58.889
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want, but I want,
I want to change that and that's where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40137-1
07:07:58.889 --> 07:08:02.391
<v Ricky Horton>the idea was that it's hard to take.
To me,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40137-2
07:08:02.391 --> 07:08:08.917
<v Ricky Horton>it's hard to take some of this production
control stuff that we're talking about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40193-0
07:08:08.917 --> 07:08:12.536
<v Ricky Horton>And really globally,
like you're saying sample setting to a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40193-1
07:08:12.536 --> 07:08:15.914
<v Ricky Horton>larger chunk,
there's that aspect or just go out and do</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40193-2
07:08:15.914 --> 07:08:19.111
<v Ricky Horton>time studies, right?
Actually just basically saying,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40193-3
07:08:19.111 --> 07:08:23.816
<v Ricky Horton>but then we have to be cognizant about
the time study sample that we're doing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40193-4
07:08:23.816 --> 07:08:27.677
<v Ricky Horton>based off of the rules that we've created
on how that you know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40202-0
07:08:27.797 --> 07:08:31.597
<v Ricky Horton>So the way I the way I perceived it
before is that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40240-0
07:08:32.557 --> 07:08:38.546
<v Ricky Horton>We know that for cuts, for example,
it's we should get the same cut time for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40240-1
07:08:38.546 --> 07:08:44.068
<v Ricky Horton>everything from a, you know,
a W8 that's you know 13 lbs up to 40 lbs.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40240-2
07:08:44.068 --> 07:08:47.957
<v Ricky Horton>So to do it through time sample,
we make sure we.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40301-0
07:08:48.157 --> 07:08:51.862
<v Ricky Horton>Take a cut list,
combine all those like sizes that match a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40301-1
07:08:51.862 --> 07:08:56.886
<v Ricky Horton>rule that we have and then apply that
time step to that specific chunk and then</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40301-2
07:08:56.886 --> 07:09:02.099
<v Ricky Horton>you validate back to what that portion is.
And then you can compare it to the next</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40301-3
07:09:02.099 --> 07:09:05.679
<v Ricky Horton>step up of you know everything from a 40
pounder and up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40301-4
07:09:05.679 --> 07:09:07.877
<v Ricky Horton>Now apply to check that section up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40347-0
07:09:07.877 --> 07:09:10.876
<v Ricky Horton>Of it,
but I don't target because I don't think</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40347-1
07:09:10.876 --> 07:09:15.687
<v Ricky Horton>you can get true data that you want to
manipulate your rule set based off of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40347-2
07:09:15.687 --> 07:09:20.498
<v Ricky Horton>just even large samples because it's
you're averaging across angles of where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40347-3
07:09:20.498 --> 07:09:25.622
<v Ricky Horton>you know that's wrong things we were told
the other day before because somebody's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40347-4
07:09:25.622 --> 07:09:26.997
<v Ricky Horton>basically fudging the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40387-0
07:09:27.477 --> 07:09:30.917
<v Ricky Horton>They say, well,
we got a guy we want to keep in the shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40387-1
07:09:30.917 --> 07:09:33.646
<v Ricky Horton>We want to lay him off.
We finished this job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40387-2
07:09:33.646 --> 07:09:36.315
<v Ricky Horton>The estimated hours was 100.
We only use 60.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40387-3
07:09:36.315 --> 07:09:41.002
<v Ricky Horton>So now we keep this guy out here working
for the other 40 hours and we post it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40387-4
07:09:41.002 --> 07:09:43.197
<v Ricky Horton>against that job. So we already know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40431-0
07:09:43.477 --> 07:09:47.446
<v Ricky Horton>The history, what you're saying,
all that history is ******** because we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40431-1
07:09:47.446 --> 07:09:51.851
<v Ricky Horton>didn't really back it properly, right.
And that's where that's where I think you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40431-2
07:09:51.851 --> 07:09:54.678
<v Ricky Horton>validate our rules based off of true time.
I agree.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40431-3
07:09:54.678 --> 07:09:58.757
<v Ricky Horton>And then and then you have the factors
and everyone agrees saying OK like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40467-0
07:09:58.997 --> 07:10:03.979
<v Ricky Horton>We did it. The guy was,
he was 100% off point, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40467-1
07:10:03.979 --> 07:10:11.322
<v Ricky Horton>and then we back it into the 80% of of of
he had to always be at his time test here</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40467-2
07:10:11.322 --> 07:10:14.557
<v Ricky Horton>when you extrapolate the data across.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40478-0
07:10:14.997 --> 07:10:21.277
<v Ricky Horton>Wide flanges because in both directions
or just up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-0
07:10:22.717 --> 07:10:26.397
<v Ricky Horton>What do you mean?
So let's say I set a factor for a W8 by</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-1
07:10:26.397 --> 07:10:29.696
<v Ricky Horton>whatever.
Is it that goes all the way up through to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-2
07:10:29.696 --> 07:10:33.250
<v Ricky Horton>a W 44? Yeah,
it was a cross-sectional area piece if if</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-3
07:10:33.250 --> 07:10:36.676
<v Ricky Horton>I'm looking at the cut.
So if I'm looking at the cut,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-4
07:10:36.676 --> 07:10:40.483
<v Ricky Horton>if it's only the cross-sectional area
that can single size,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40526-5
07:10:40.483 --> 07:10:42.197
<v Ricky Horton>then they can go or shrink.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40562-0
07:10:42.477 --> 07:10:47.420
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say my numbers work.
Jimmy was saying for this range.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40562-1
07:10:47.420 --> 07:10:52.364
<v Ricky Horton>Now when I get to that range, yeah,
my number is different.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40562-2
07:10:52.364 --> 07:10:57.637
<v Ricky Horton>Now let's say I decide and AW24.
I put a new factor as it goes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40594-0
07:10:57.957 --> 07:11:02.740
<v Ricky Horton>That direction too.
You can tell it which way you want to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40594-1
07:11:02.740 --> 07:11:06.974
<v Ricky Horton>there. So when when I did it,
I I took one one piece.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40594-2
07:11:06.974 --> 07:11:12.227
<v Ricky Horton>Here's the we cut and exactly how long it
took. I put it on there,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40594-3
07:11:12.227 --> 07:11:13.717
<v Ricky Horton>pass it everything.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40637-0
07:11:13.797 --> 07:11:21.098
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. And what I found was that it was,
it was generally OK within a range and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40637-1
07:11:21.098 --> 07:11:28.676
<v Ricky Horton>then I had to get a new range felt like
like you were talking about it was like 8</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40637-2
07:11:28.676 --> 07:11:31.357
<v Ricky Horton>and 10 inch means I was good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40684-0
07:11:31.717 --> 07:11:36.201
<v Ricky Horton>But and I wanted to get some kind in the
middle there, right? And but 2014,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40684-1
07:11:36.201 --> 07:11:39.682
<v Ricky Horton>I had made a new,
a new one that I outlined it to and it's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40684-2
07:11:39.682 --> 07:11:44.107
<v Ricky Horton>probably want to be on your machinery
today or how you sure as long as you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40684-3
07:11:44.107 --> 07:11:49.064
<v Ricky Horton>don't have to keep throwing them all in,
but you know that it's range driven, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40684-4
07:11:49.064 --> 07:11:49.477
<v Ricky Horton>I mean.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40714-0
07:11:49.877 --> 07:11:53.779
<v Ricky Horton>Wait,
you're gonna have to create rules in your</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40714-1
07:11:53.779 --> 07:11:59.957
<v Ricky Horton>process that say these are our ranges and
then when your equipment changes,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40714-2
07:11:59.957 --> 07:12:04.997
<v Ricky Horton>you have to realize you have to go fix
that I I I really got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40768-0
07:12:05.757 --> 07:12:10.248
<v Ricky Horton>Got multiple different samples from
different sizes and all up and down</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40768-1
07:12:10.248 --> 07:12:13.429
<v Ricky Horton>through there and then I would take one,
apply it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40768-2
07:12:13.429 --> 07:12:18.420
<v Ricky Horton>see how far that got me when I hit the
next size that I did that I measured and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40768-3
07:12:18.420 --> 07:12:22.973
<v Ricky Horton>it was like how close am I there? OK,
that's really really close enough,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40768-4
07:12:22.973 --> 07:12:25.157
<v Ricky Horton>good enough, but then the next one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40801-0
07:12:25.397 --> 07:12:29.207
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll use that one to move up to the
next one. So yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40801-1
07:12:29.207 --> 07:12:32.229
<v Ricky Horton>you you you can pick whatever range you
want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40801-2
07:12:32.229 --> 07:12:37.353
<v Ricky Horton>Now that that was cutting and then you
got other stuff that's it extrapolates</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40801-3
07:12:37.353 --> 07:12:42.477
<v Ricky Horton>based off of length or about weight.
That could be a totally different story.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40834-0
07:12:42.917 --> 07:12:48.641
<v Ricky Horton>But just you can send it whatever range
you want. So got a question.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40834-1
07:12:48.641 --> 07:12:53.535
<v Ricky Horton>So we've created these for you said
whatever your channel,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40834-2
07:12:53.535 --> 07:12:59.757
<v Ricky Horton>whatever we're cutting on here,
the guys are telling us how long it takes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40866-0
07:13:00.037 --> 07:13:05.360
<v Ricky Horton>Got it. Correct. They're signing it off.
If they're doing the start slot on the on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40866-1
07:13:05.360 --> 07:13:10.426
<v Ricky Horton>the cap list then, yeah. So if we were,
but we haven't been doing that, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40866-2
07:13:10.426 --> 07:13:14.595
<v Ricky Horton>Right. But if we were,
would it then take that data and apply it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40866-3
07:13:14.595 --> 07:13:15.557
<v Ricky Horton>to? Yeah, that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40909-0
07:13:16.397 --> 07:13:20.224
<v Ricky Horton>If I understand what you're asking,
if they didn't start,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40909-1
07:13:20.224 --> 07:13:25.107
<v Ricky Horton>stop on there and the contracting,
both of those would hit your schedule.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40909-2
07:13:25.107 --> 07:13:29.660
<v Ricky Horton>So you might duplicate that one out,
but it's still going to have to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40909-3
07:13:29.660 --> 07:13:34.477
<v Ricky Horton>somebody's going to have to actually
interpret and manipulate that data.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40951-0
07:13:34.677 --> 07:13:37.896
<v Ricky Horton>And yeah,
to be able to do anything back on a date</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40951-1
07:13:37.896 --> 07:13:40.925
<v Ricky Horton>change,
it's not gonna look at the next job and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40951-2
07:13:40.925 --> 07:13:45.785
<v Ricky Horton>go Nope, helping us. Yeah, no, no.
But you would want to. You wouldn't want,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40951-3
07:13:45.785 --> 07:13:50.203
<v Ricky Horton>you want to capture it. Yeah,
and you would want to trend the haywork</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40951-4
07:13:50.203 --> 07:13:54.117
<v Ricky Horton>consistently in this size and
consistently not hitting hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40992-0
07:13:54.197 --> 07:13:59.103
<v Ricky Horton>Let's figure out why. And then it's yeah,
because maybe one guy's buying 60s and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40992-1
07:13:59.103 --> 07:14:03.828
<v Ricky Horton>another guy's buying 20s and he's out in
the low three times as much and it's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40992-2
07:14:03.828 --> 07:14:08.552
<v Ricky Horton>being captured in the bed zone. Yeah,
and make sure your average measure too,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/40992-3
07:14:08.552 --> 07:14:09.037
<v Ricky Horton>because.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41021-0
07:14:09.397 --> 07:14:14.248
<v Ricky Horton>When you if you say tell me how long it
takes to cut this, well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41021-1
07:14:14.248 --> 07:14:19.772
<v Ricky Horton>are we talking just bladed like running
time or are we talking about, OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41021-2
07:14:19.772 --> 07:14:23.877
<v Ricky Horton>I've got to put it in feed up, roll it up,
get it set.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41057-0
07:14:24.597 --> 07:14:30.252
<v Ricky Horton>Now cut it and it goes out and that's
good. Make sure you know what you're.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41057-1
07:14:30.252 --> 07:14:34.344
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, my brain, yeah,
my brain is here's a cut list.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41057-2
07:14:34.344 --> 07:14:37.619
<v Ricky Horton>There's 23 pieces on it. Yeah. Start,
stop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41057-3
07:14:37.619 --> 07:14:41.637
<v Ricky Horton>How many cuts did I get that picks all
that up? Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41104-0
07:14:41.757 --> 07:14:46.882
<v Ricky Horton>But it needs to that start stop needs to
correlate to how the moves actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41104-1
07:14:46.882 --> 07:14:50.743
<v Ricky Horton>written, right?
So it's because technically I believe the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41104-2
07:14:50.743 --> 07:14:55.935
<v Ricky Horton>way we assumed it originally was that the
the starting is when he gets there,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41104-3
07:14:55.935 --> 07:14:59.197
<v Ricky Horton>pull starts pulling tape right across
does this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41159-0
07:14:59.397 --> 07:15:03.673
<v Ricky Horton>Check gets it bit up,
gets the clamps in and starts because</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41159-1
07:15:03.673 --> 07:15:06.809
<v Ricky Horton>rising you know on it and indexing it
over.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41159-2
07:15:06.809 --> 07:15:12.511
<v Ricky Horton>That's your start stop on what one cut
would be OK and and one of the things we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41159-3
07:15:12.511 --> 07:15:18.141
<v Ricky Horton>have a long long time ago was we just
have like a basic Excel spreadsheet that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41159-4
07:15:18.141 --> 07:15:18.997
<v Ricky Horton>just showed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-0
07:15:19.117 --> 07:15:22.452
<v Ricky Horton>What the process was,
what the rule was and then just had a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-1
07:15:22.452 --> 07:15:26.899
<v Ricky Horton>narrative of kind of where we assumed
that that number kind of was coming from,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-2
07:15:26.899 --> 07:15:29.234
<v Ricky Horton>right.
And then so the it's two different</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-3
07:15:29.234 --> 07:15:32.458
<v Ricky Horton>numbers, right.
It's just that he said it's just off time</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-4
07:15:32.458 --> 07:15:36.738
<v Ricky Horton>versus what the operator is doing to
complete an overall where's the rest of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41202-5
07:15:36.738 --> 07:15:37.517
<v Ricky Horton>the classroom.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41240-0
07:15:37.717 --> 07:15:42.169
<v Ricky Horton>It would go handling is so OK,
there's a lot of overlap and I think you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41240-1
07:15:42.169 --> 07:15:46.559
<v Ricky Horton>guys, right? Correct me wrong,
but there's a lot of overlap of what is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41240-2
07:15:46.559 --> 07:15:51.443
<v Ricky Horton>considered the handling time and where
the time's allocated there and how that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41240-3
07:15:51.443 --> 07:15:53.917
<v Ricky Horton>goes to cut time and then how that goes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41275-0
07:15:54.117 --> 07:15:59.407
<v Ricky Horton>Clean up or handling to go to the next,
the next station and does every got new.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41275-1
07:15:59.407 --> 07:16:02.672
<v Ricky Horton>It started last week.
Does everybody in the shop,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41275-2
07:16:02.672 --> 07:16:07.505
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure there's some turnover there.
Does everybody know those rules and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41275-3
07:16:07.505 --> 07:16:08.877
<v Ricky Horton>that's where I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41314-0
07:16:08.917 --> 07:16:14.005
<v Ricky Horton>I think, I think getting estimators,
understanding exactly what the numbers</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41314-1
07:16:14.005 --> 07:16:17.687
<v Ricky Horton>really mean,
getting them on board with how things are</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41314-2
07:16:17.687 --> 07:16:21.437
<v Ricky Horton>actually going.
So you can look for the outliers of OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41314-3
07:16:21.437 --> 07:16:24.517
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, so we're assuming it's this, this,
but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41357-0
07:16:24.877 --> 07:16:27.227
<v Ricky Horton>I'm estimating something that's 80 foot
long,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41357-1
07:16:27.227 --> 07:16:31.262
<v Ricky Horton>so the guy's gonna have to give him some
extra time because he's gonna have to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41357-2
07:16:31.262 --> 07:16:35.042
<v Ricky Horton>walk all the way over there and then walk
all the way back kind of thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41357-3
07:16:35.042 --> 07:16:38.823
<v Ricky Horton>But understanding where those your
parameters live or 100% efficiency and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41357-4
07:16:38.823 --> 07:16:41.837
<v Ricky Horton>where you should manipulate something
going into the next.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41389-0
07:16:42.037 --> 07:16:48.038
<v Ricky Horton>Sage fitness is another big one on where
we draw the line on fitting a standard</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41389-1
07:16:48.038 --> 07:16:53.665
<v Ricky Horton>stiffener in a beam or a base plate
versus A-frame section or above 3 inch</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41389-2
07:16:53.665 --> 07:16:58.917
<v Ricky Horton>base plate kind of understanding or
estimating side of where to take.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41428-0
07:16:58.957 --> 07:17:03.989
<v Ricky Horton>What we're talking about base hours and
where you actually are a true estimator</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41428-1
07:17:03.989 --> 07:17:08.833
<v Ricky Horton>and really adjust your hours to what the
complexity is and maybe you do that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41428-2
07:17:08.833 --> 07:17:14.117
<v Ricky Horton>within just the overall efficiency factor
is that the beginning estimate part, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41449-0
07:17:14.437 --> 07:17:19.714
<v Ricky Horton>Do you wanna globally do that across an
entire 1000 ton project or you just do it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41449-1
07:17:19.714 --> 07:17:24.091
<v Ricky Horton>on a couple of parts? Who?
Who's the master of that domain of those</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41449-2
07:17:24.091 --> 07:17:24.477
<v Ricky Horton>rules?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41470-0
07:17:25.557 --> 07:17:32.543
<v Ricky Horton>Gavin, that's your hand.
I it's either the estimators don't really</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41470-1
07:17:32.543 --> 07:17:39.111
<v Ricky Horton>listen to you. Well,
and so the hard part is we haven't really</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41470-2
07:17:39.111 --> 07:17:41.197
<v Ricky Horton>defined how we want.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41517-0
07:17:41.717 --> 07:17:44.722
<v Ricky Horton>Like what what process we want for time
studies,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41517-1
07:17:44.722 --> 07:17:49.568
<v Ricky Horton>because I can take time out of what I'm
doing to put time study stuff together</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41517-2
07:17:49.568 --> 07:17:54.660
<v Ricky Horton>and we can make the adjustments to this.
We just need to put a plan together on on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41517-3
07:17:54.660 --> 07:17:59.567
<v Ricky Horton>how frequently we want to do that and
then make sure we're all on the same page</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41517-4
07:17:59.567 --> 07:18:00.917
<v Ricky Horton>for how I am doing it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41575-0
07:18:01.597 --> 07:18:06.246
<v Ricky Horton>And so most of what we have in here,
we haven't done too much crazy</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41575-1
07:18:06.246 --> 07:18:10.143
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments since the first time studies
were performed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41575-2
07:18:10.143 --> 07:18:14.177
<v Ricky Horton>We've never adjusted for the first time
studies, but this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41575-3
07:18:14.177 --> 07:18:19.237
<v Ricky Horton>this was set up once and never touched it
after that. So and and we just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41612-0
07:18:19.277 --> 07:18:23.206
<v Ricky Horton>Five new investments to to Weld
deposition rates. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41612-1
07:18:23.206 --> 07:18:27.486
<v Ricky Horton>'cause they were super slow. Yeah, so,
but anyway, but yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41612-2
07:18:27.486 --> 07:18:33.100
<v Ricky Horton>a lot of that stuff's either fascinating.
It's is that and that's where I think</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41612-3
07:18:33.100 --> 07:18:35.837
<v Ricky Horton>goes into the trending aspect of it of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41665-0
07:18:35.917 --> 07:18:38.448
<v Ricky Horton>Really,
if we can get a true understanding,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41665-1
07:18:38.448 --> 07:18:43.107
<v Ricky Horton>make sure everyone's on the same page
where the start and stop somewhere, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41665-2
07:18:43.107 --> 07:18:45.983
<v Ricky Horton>And then then when Mark we have to say,
hey guys,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41665-3
07:18:45.983 --> 07:18:49.895
<v Ricky Horton>the the budget's not good because of this
assembly is this or that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41665-4
07:18:49.895 --> 07:18:54.037
<v Ricky Horton>we can at least have a baseline of what
was established on what it was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41706-0
07:18:54.277 --> 07:18:58.089
<v Ricky Horton>Base powers are and why?
Because a lot of times it's between the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41706-1
07:18:58.089 --> 07:19:01.609
<v Ricky Horton>estimator and it's uh.
Are you guys sure that it's actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41706-2
07:19:01.609 --> 07:19:05.011
<v Ricky Horton>gonna take the much time?
It's just one more time, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41706-3
07:19:05.011 --> 07:19:09.117
<v Ricky Horton>It's their argument on the back side,
so that's when it doesn't work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41735-0
07:19:09.517 --> 07:19:13.703
<v Ricky Horton>And and put as much time as possible.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41735-1
07:19:13.703 --> 07:19:21.123
<v Ricky Horton>when you guys are trying to make some of
the kit, but it's always rely on it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41735-2
07:19:21.123 --> 07:19:27.117
<v Ricky Horton>but it's always 100% always solid.
I'll speak to that and one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41778-0
07:19:27.197 --> 07:19:35.003
<v Ricky Horton>But one adjustment today with the
categories is I we used to have a lot of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41778-1
07:19:35.003 --> 07:19:40.520
<v Ricky Horton>categories later.
So now if the estimator estimates,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41778-2
07:19:40.520 --> 07:19:46.557
<v Ricky Horton>we get it the way our PC funnel right now,
yes, they can.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41809-0
07:19:46.637 --> 07:19:50.776
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So with the exception of,
I mean there's a few special exceptions</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41809-1
07:19:50.776 --> 07:19:55.330
<v Ricky Horton>and then as me and Ricky were talking,
this is going to muddy some stuff up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41809-2
07:19:55.330 --> 07:19:57.637
<v Ricky Horton>So we're probably going to go here and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41860-0
07:19:58.957 --> 07:20:04.522
<v Ricky Horton>Eliminate that other category and so that
we have that because then when we link an</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41860-1
07:20:04.522 --> 07:20:08.895
<v Ricky Horton>estimate going forward,
this will tie into each of our categories</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41860-2
07:20:08.895 --> 07:20:13.931
<v Ricky Horton>that we have in our our production
schedule and then jive with our PC forms</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41860-3
07:20:13.931 --> 07:20:18.437
<v Ricky Horton>and those look like when you link an
estimate from the estimate to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41867-0
07:20:18.957 --> 07:20:22.557
<v Ricky Horton>The Uh prediction control is that in the
main towers then?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41921-0
07:20:24.437 --> 07:20:27.628
<v Ricky Horton>Does that hold into the original
estimated hours?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41921-1
07:20:27.628 --> 07:20:31.650
<v Ricky Horton>It it nothing holds in the original
estimate. You you have to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41921-2
07:20:31.650 --> 07:20:36.821
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you would work with. Yeah,
because usually on the estimate you don't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41921-3
07:20:36.821 --> 07:20:41.225
<v Ricky Horton>know what a sequence is or what a lot is.
You don't know great deal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41921-4
07:20:41.225 --> 07:20:43.077
<v Ricky Horton>So it can't interpolate that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41962-0
07:20:43.277 --> 07:20:48.528
<v Ricky Horton>So you have to put that in.
The late hours are if you did start stop</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41962-1
07:20:48.528 --> 07:20:54.312
<v Ricky Horton>on the station or when you're coming,
that would be the actual hours coming</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/41962-2
07:20:54.312 --> 07:20:58.117
<v Ricky Horton>back in from that start stop on that
station, so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-0
07:20:59.117 --> 07:21:01.462
<v Ricky Horton>That that's what I was going to say
before.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-1
07:21:01.462 --> 07:21:05.033
<v Ricky Horton>If you were to do time studies with the
star stop on the stations,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-2
07:21:05.033 --> 07:21:08.923
<v Ricky Horton>which is an awesome way to do it,
you just got to watch on your schedule</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-3
07:21:08.923 --> 07:21:12.921
<v Ricky Horton>because then you're right on double up
and you guys go to the star stop on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-4
07:21:12.921 --> 07:21:17.024
<v Ricky Horton>tongue tracking and then you would be on
the star stop on a station as well.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42040-5
07:21:17.024 --> 07:21:18.677
<v Ricky Horton>So if it would double up hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42087-0
07:21:18.717 --> 07:21:22.931
<v Ricky Horton>To come back to your your your sample
approach of how you do it is you don't</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42087-1
07:21:22.931 --> 07:21:26.324
<v Ricky Horton>want to go out there and then time study
just one cut, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42087-2
07:21:26.324 --> 07:21:30.976
<v Ricky Horton>But if we can group them based off of the
rule and you say OK, here's your cut list,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42087-3
07:21:30.976 --> 07:21:33.877
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
let's say it's two hours with the cutting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42155-0
07:21:34.237 --> 07:21:38.828
<v Ricky Horton>Right. We can now backtrack that into,
well, OK, he actually took two hours,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42155-1
07:21:38.828 --> 07:21:43.361
<v Ricky Horton>he was like 30 cuts and we can back that
into an average based off of that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42155-2
07:21:43.361 --> 07:21:46.581
<v Ricky Horton>So some's gonna be,
he's gonna hit it the first time,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42155-3
07:21:46.581 --> 07:21:51.113
<v Ricky Horton>some he's gonna have to double check
because you know he burned an inch and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42155-4
07:21:51.113 --> 07:21:53.797
<v Ricky Horton>forgot about it or whatever is right.
So if.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42197-0
07:21:53.997 --> 07:21:58.603
<v Ricky Horton>It's creating a big enough sample,
but that sample has to match the rule or</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42197-1
07:21:58.603 --> 07:22:02.059
<v Ricky Horton>else it it just blends.
And so I think we need to really</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42197-2
07:22:02.059 --> 07:22:06.787
<v Ricky Horton>establish what those rules are and then
we can spot check and what we've done</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42197-3
07:22:06.787 --> 07:22:09.757
<v Ricky Horton>before too is we get into these bigger
packages.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42238-0
07:22:10.637 --> 07:22:14.320
<v Ricky Horton>We can then take those rules and we want
to get competitive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42238-1
07:22:14.320 --> 07:22:19.391
<v Ricky Horton>We can go do a couple samples and say, OK,
we know that we're going to be running a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42238-2
07:22:19.391 --> 07:22:22.470
<v Ricky Horton>bunch of 40 LB beeps, right?
So let's go take one,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42238-3
07:22:22.470 --> 07:22:26.757
<v Ricky Horton>let's just run it through and then OK,
we can actually fine tune that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42280-0
07:22:27.117 --> 07:22:30.387
<v Ricky Horton>A little bit and get get competitive or
something.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42280-1
07:22:30.387 --> 07:22:33.914
<v Ricky Horton>That's where you could have used that
efficiency back.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42280-2
07:22:33.914 --> 07:22:38.660
<v Ricky Horton>I think we're going to get enough
efficiency on this. I'm on three. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42280-3
07:22:38.660 --> 07:22:42.957
<v Ricky Horton>like the the mark disappeared with me,
but the vanish is right we.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42333-0
07:22:43.037 --> 07:22:48.103
<v Ricky Horton>We should have ran that at higher
efficiency than whatever the standard 75%</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42333-1
07:22:48.103 --> 07:22:51.437
<v Ricky Horton>is in there because there are 12
identical skits.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42333-2
07:22:51.437 --> 07:22:56.703
<v Ricky Horton>So you should be able to fixture up gear
up of that much volume of them if you</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42333-3
07:22:56.703 --> 07:22:59.037
<v Ricky Horton>have a reframe, but we should have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42385-0
07:22:59.277 --> 07:23:03.419
<v Ricky Horton>We should get more efficient as we do
that because they're 12 or something</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42385-1
07:23:03.419 --> 07:23:07.008
<v Ricky Horton>that's repetitive, right?
I'll use argument that if you're doing</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42385-2
07:23:07.008 --> 07:23:11.316
<v Ricky Horton>1000 different beans that you have to
treat each one of the things you're not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42385-3
07:23:11.316 --> 07:23:15.403
<v Ricky Horton>gearing up because they're all different,
right? There's no cheap set up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42385-4
07:23:15.403 --> 07:23:17.557
<v Ricky Horton>There's things exactly. So in terms of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42423-0
07:23:18.117 --> 07:23:21.911
<v Ricky Horton>Quantity efficiency.
You should actually bring your hours down</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42423-1
07:23:21.911 --> 07:23:26.851
<v Ricky Horton>based off of what your base is and not
add approach to it in terms of quantities.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42423-2
07:23:26.851 --> 07:23:31.609
<v Ricky Horton>But you got to kind of get these base
samples based on the rules to know where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42423-3
07:23:31.609 --> 07:23:33.597
<v Ricky Horton>to actually where the rules live.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42470-0
07:23:35.037 --> 07:23:38.013
<v Ricky Horton>That's being right.
Like that's where the that's where all</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42470-1
07:23:38.013 --> 07:23:41.342
<v Ricky Horton>the rules are applying.
But there's some there is somebody's head</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42470-2
07:23:41.342 --> 07:23:44.671
<v Ricky Horton>or in somebody's paper.
That's why we need to get it out of this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42470-3
07:23:44.671 --> 07:23:47.798
<v Ricky Horton>We need to get out of the system.
So if you just go on, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42470-4
07:23:47.798 --> 07:23:51.077
<v Ricky Horton>it's in maintenance, right?
It's where we have them established.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42499-0
07:23:52.437 --> 07:23:58.643
<v Ricky Horton>It's been it's been a while.
It's essentially an if then statements,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42499-1
07:23:58.643 --> 07:24:02.330
<v Ricky Horton>right?
We've been thinking these numbers</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42499-2
07:24:02.330 --> 07:24:06.378
<v Ricky Horton>yesterday and today,
so if there were rules,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42499-3
07:24:06.378 --> 07:24:08.357
<v Ricky Horton>they're now different.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42513-0
07:24:09.917 --> 07:24:15.548
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we've made minute adjustments to to cut</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42513-1
07:24:15.548 --> 07:24:20.077
<v Ricky Horton>and it's different. Let's just go to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42535-0
07:24:21.037 --> 07:24:25.287
<v Ricky Horton>And what you're saying,
just just click on beans,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42535-1
07:24:25.287 --> 07:24:29.877
<v Ricky Horton>don't filter on down like that and then
sort by code.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42603-0
07:24:31.357 --> 07:24:36.109
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if this is what you're
referring to, but up at the top. So this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42603-1
07:24:36.109 --> 07:24:39.034
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know this is what you're talking
about.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42603-2
07:24:39.034 --> 07:24:43.542
<v Ricky Horton>There's an unload which is get it off the
truck, lay it down in the yard.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42603-3
07:24:43.542 --> 07:24:48.112
<v Ricky Horton>There's a get piece which you get out of
the yard, take it to the machine.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42603-4
07:24:48.112 --> 07:24:51.037
<v Ricky Horton>I think you should talk about the if
statement.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42641-0
07:24:51.037 --> 07:24:55.507
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna end up with end if, yeah,
so varies directly by weight, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42641-1
07:24:55.507 --> 07:24:59.132
<v Ricky Horton>So where do we really,
where do we really vary by weight on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42641-2
07:24:59.132 --> 07:25:02.757
<v Ricky Horton>those sections, right?
But not actually if then statements,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42641-3
07:25:02.757 --> 07:25:05.597
<v Ricky Horton>right? Like if it's if it's this weight,
then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42650-0
07:25:06.157 --> 07:25:11.011
<v Ricky Horton>If it's this way to this way,
then you're gonna so where can you do the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42650-1
07:25:11.011 --> 07:25:12.157
<v Ricky Horton>labor factor for?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42684-0
07:25:13.117 --> 07:25:17.178
<v Ricky Horton>We must move both of them.
So getting right there very directly on</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42684-1
07:25:17.178 --> 07:25:20.149
<v Ricky Horton>cross-section. I know,
but we're in the segment.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42684-2
07:25:20.149 --> 07:25:24.150
<v Ricky Horton>We were deeper in it than that.
Like where the time is, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42684-3
07:25:24.150 --> 07:25:28.150
<v Ricky Horton>the maintenance, estimating,
labor maintenance and labor standard</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42684-4
07:25:28.150 --> 07:25:28.757
<v Ricky Horton>standards.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42712-0
07:25:34.917 --> 07:25:41.765
<v Ricky Horton>Specific size that is good, right?
So right here we looked at some some</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42712-1
07:25:41.765 --> 07:25:46.997
<v Ricky Horton>other jobs and we made an adjustment to
these minutes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42752-0
07:25:48.237 --> 07:25:55.106
<v Ricky Horton>And then ran the job to see if it could
match the job. On job A, it's like, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42752-1
07:25:55.106 --> 07:26:00.970
<v Ricky Horton>we're great. On job B, not so much.
On job C, it was a little closer,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42752-2
07:26:00.970 --> 07:26:04.237
<v Ricky Horton>but we were messing with it right here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42795-0
07:26:04.277 --> 07:26:11.456
<v Ricky Horton>So what my question to you is are there
actually rules currently for these times?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42795-1
07:26:11.456 --> 07:26:18.198
<v Ricky Horton>So that that one minute 39 seconds is
based off of the cross-sectional area,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42795-2
07:26:18.198 --> 07:26:20.037
<v Ricky Horton>right? But then it's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42836-0
07:26:20.197 --> 07:26:23.527
<v Ricky Horton>But then it's the cut.
It's really the unload.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42836-1
07:26:23.527 --> 07:26:29.338
<v Ricky Horton>See how that's just a generic 12 minutes?
Can't tell me that that three by five's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42836-2
07:26:29.338 --> 07:26:34.086
<v Ricky Horton>gonna actually take 12 minutes. OK,
but what? What defines 3 by 5?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42836-3
07:26:34.086 --> 07:26:38.197
<v Ricky Horton>What defines 12 minutes?
And when I remember it's saying.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42888-0
07:26:38.317 --> 07:26:41.215
<v Ricky Horton>Any number from 0 lbs to 30 lbs is 12
minutes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42888-1
07:26:41.215 --> 07:26:45.717
<v Ricky Horton>So I think it's 40 feet takes 12 minutes,
right? And yeah, so that's it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42888-2
07:26:45.717 --> 07:26:49.602
<v Ricky Horton>So the 40 foot mark,
but it's and that's where the easiest way</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42888-3
07:26:49.602 --> 07:26:54.350
<v Ricky Horton>I could ever look at it was in Excel.
So spreadsheet of cuts and you kind of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42888-4
07:26:54.350 --> 07:26:57.557
<v Ricky Horton>start grouping all the if then statements
together.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42923-0
07:26:58.157 --> 07:27:04.100
<v Ricky Horton>And you start defining the table,
why is it the 14 counter takes or a 40</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42923-1
07:27:04.100 --> 07:27:09.066
<v Ricky Horton>footer takes 15 minutes versus a 39
footer takes like where?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42923-2
07:27:09.066 --> 07:27:14.277
<v Ricky Horton>Why is that that range right?
And then you start justifying it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42979-0
07:27:14.557 --> 07:27:17.707
<v Ricky Horton>From there,
because if you just had a load of three</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42979-1
07:27:17.707 --> 07:27:21.645
<v Ricky Horton>by fives that are like,
let's say you have the exact same length</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42979-2
07:27:21.645 --> 07:27:26.491
<v Ricky Horton>on three by fives bundle cutting, right?
And you're gonna bundle cut 20 of them</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42979-3
07:27:26.491 --> 07:27:29.278
<v Ricky Horton>together. You don't want to put it,
you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/42979-4
07:27:29.278 --> 07:27:33.277
<v Ricky Horton>because it would be it would be labeled
exactly and that's where.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43021-0
07:27:33.277 --> 07:27:37.904
<v Ricky Horton>Understanding really where these times
are really kind of compiled from a just a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43021-1
07:27:37.904 --> 07:27:40.931
<v Ricky Horton>global management standpoint,
estimating standpoint,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43021-2
07:27:40.931 --> 07:27:44.301
<v Ricky Horton>everything like that.
That's where you want to be able to,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43021-3
07:27:44.301 --> 07:27:48.071
<v Ricky Horton>I think go in the full picture,
go into where we're talking about</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43021-4
07:27:48.071 --> 07:27:49.157
<v Ricky Horton>tweaking our hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43068-0
07:27:49.517 --> 07:27:52.057
<v Ricky Horton>And really going from a base hour
standpoint,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43068-1
07:27:52.057 --> 07:27:56.530
<v Ricky Horton>knowing that there's no way where it can
actually take us about hours and adjust</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43068-2
07:27:56.530 --> 07:27:59.622
<v Ricky Horton>again from there.
But you have to have the knowledge of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43068-3
07:27:59.622 --> 07:28:03.322
<v Ricky Horton>where the hours are coming from to be
able to make that, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43068-4
07:28:03.322 --> 07:28:07.077
<v Ricky Horton>and that's I wouldn't go down through
your line by line either and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43113-0
07:28:07.557 --> 07:28:12.385
<v Ricky Horton>Say, well, how long to move?
How long to do both the clips like you'll</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43113-1
07:28:12.385 --> 07:28:15.921
<v Ricky Horton>drive yourself?
That's because there's all of these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43113-2
07:28:15.921 --> 07:28:20.749
<v Ricky Horton>extraneous factors that are the
exceptions as well, right? So cutting,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43113-3
07:28:20.749 --> 07:28:24.829
<v Ricky Horton>sure, good measurement. That's easy.
That's empirical data.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43113-4
07:28:24.829 --> 07:28:27.277
<v Ricky Horton>That's just it is what it is, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43159-0
07:28:27.357 --> 07:28:31.644
<v Ricky Horton>You got to get that,
but all the handling and layout and stuff,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43159-1
07:28:31.644 --> 07:28:34.993
<v Ricky Horton>I'll probably look at it on the Mac for
your job,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43159-2
07:28:34.993 --> 07:28:39.615
<v Ricky Horton>the job place is kind of like we did and
tweak all of it up or down,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43159-3
07:28:39.615 --> 07:28:44.973
<v Ricky Horton>because otherwise I'll just be down the
road and you're going to drive yourself</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43159-4
07:28:44.973 --> 07:28:47.117
<v Ricky Horton>nuts trying to do it one by one.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43214-0
07:28:47.117 --> 07:28:52.500
<v Ricky Horton>So in other words,
let's go see about Bolta and we're going</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43214-1
07:28:52.500 --> 07:28:59.229
<v Ricky Horton>to change that one line and I think
that's knowing where the groupings go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43214-2
07:28:59.229 --> 07:29:06.317
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's going to help define how you
break those signals and blocks down.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43258-0
07:29:06.357 --> 07:29:11.759
<v Ricky Horton>It's a lock down so that you can actually
come up with a good sample size that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43258-1
07:29:11.759 --> 07:29:17.435
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't have a lot of other factors into
it to give yourself good and careful data</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43258-2
07:29:17.435 --> 07:29:23.317
<v Ricky Horton>on if you're hitting your your average 25,
but if and but just understanding kind of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43293-0
07:29:23.837 --> 07:29:26.985
<v Ricky Horton>Where your give and take are in the
little section,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43293-1
07:29:26.985 --> 07:29:31.769
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's really where getting good
data back because at the end of the day</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43293-2
07:29:31.769 --> 07:29:36.734
<v Ricky Horton>that's I think I mean take estimating out
of it if you have a good set of data in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43293-3
07:29:36.734 --> 07:29:39.277
<v Ricky Horton>here that we really trust and really know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43330-0
07:29:39.477 --> 07:29:44.639
<v Ricky Horton>Where we can push and where we can give.
Everything else is just a take off food,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43330-1
07:29:44.639 --> 07:29:47.472
<v Ricky Horton>right?
It's just you just have your funds to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43330-2
07:29:47.472 --> 07:29:52.508
<v Ricky Horton>take off food. You can rely on this data,
but if we don't know where we can and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43330-3
07:29:52.508 --> 07:29:54.397
<v Ricky Horton>can't rely on this data, it's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43365-0
07:29:54.677 --> 07:30:01.615
<v Ricky Horton>Might just go back to the dark thing.
It's gotta be you gotta get really good</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43365-1
07:30:01.615 --> 07:30:08.465
<v Ricky Horton>actual data back and I I don't think
anybody here really kind of trusted the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43365-2
07:30:08.465 --> 07:30:11.757
<v Ricky Horton>actual numbers we were looking at so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43402-0
07:30:12.437 --> 07:30:17.327
<v Ricky Horton>It's really got to be.
You got to make sure there's hours on the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43402-1
07:30:17.327 --> 07:30:21.992
<v Ricky Horton>jet motor and the DDS unit.
And I maybe they weren't the jet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43402-2
07:30:21.992 --> 07:30:26.356
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. Well,
they're so perfect that I'm just not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43402-3
07:30:26.356 --> 07:30:28.237
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't trust them, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43437-0
07:30:28.717 --> 07:30:32.737
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, job started really good last. Well,
I think that's the goal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43437-1
07:30:32.737 --> 07:30:37.177
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's what they were trying to
share that they were really good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43437-2
07:30:37.177 --> 07:30:42.097
<v Ricky Horton>But it's, I mean at the end of the day,
I mean let's just take the the management</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43437-3
07:30:42.097 --> 07:30:43.597
<v Ricky Horton>profitability side of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43488-0
07:30:43.797 --> 07:30:49.170
<v Ricky Horton>We want good data back to start getting
this accurate to where we can trust it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43488-1
07:30:49.170 --> 07:30:52.435
<v Ricky Horton>and we can do it.
There's the sales side of it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43488-2
07:30:52.435 --> 07:30:57.060
<v Ricky Horton>knowing when you can get more money and
when we can be competitive.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43488-3
07:30:57.060 --> 07:31:00.597
<v Ricky Horton>And then there's the management side
where I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43522-0
07:31:01.117 --> 07:31:06.830
<v Ricky Horton>Mark really he wants to go is being able
to accurately know how many meeting hours</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43522-1
07:31:06.830 --> 07:31:10.685
<v Ricky Horton>he needs to do something so he can really
say customer,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43522-2
07:31:10.685 --> 07:31:15.917
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna have this to you on Tuesday.
Yeah, and really plan out to know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43570-0
07:31:16.277 --> 07:31:21.546
<v Ricky Horton>I'm overloaded on a saw for the next six
months, right? I need to get another saw.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43570-1
07:31:21.546 --> 07:31:25.989
<v Ricky Horton>I need to get 2 ships going,
another operator instead of just kind of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43570-2
07:31:25.989 --> 07:31:30.814
<v Ricky Horton>winging it, right? I mean, to me,
there's a lot of the being in a job shop,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43570-3
07:31:30.814 --> 07:31:34.877
<v Ricky Horton>take out the subject stuff that we do,
right, being a job shop.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43608-0
07:31:35.157 --> 07:31:40.995
<v Ricky Horton>Supporting the field and getting stuff on
time is is a huge failure because those</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43608-1
07:31:40.995 --> 07:31:45.552
<v Ricky Horton>guys, I mean, we're burning cranes,
we're burning fire watches,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43608-2
07:31:45.552 --> 07:31:51.320
<v Ricky Horton>like all sorts of hours go into delaying
some of the stuff because of production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43608-3
07:31:51.320 --> 07:31:52.317
<v Ricky Horton>and Mark gets.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43663-0
07:31:53.557 --> 07:31:58.640
<v Ricky Horton>The buzzing the lollipop a lot of times
because we're finishing up the design,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43663-1
07:31:58.640 --> 07:32:03.788
<v Ricky Horton>design's always behind and the labor and
execution is always getting pushed up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43663-2
07:32:03.788 --> 07:32:08.871
<v Ricky Horton>So he's trying to really fit things in a
narrow window while juggling 12 other</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43663-3
07:32:08.871 --> 07:32:11.317
<v Ricky Horton>ones and being able to accurately say.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43684-0
07:32:11.677 --> 07:32:15.318
<v Ricky Horton>Like this is really what it's gonna take
us. I can plan this out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43684-1
07:32:15.318 --> 07:32:19.677
<v Ricky Horton>You know you're gonna get it on on the
states. There's a big schedule to push.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43706-0
07:32:20.997 --> 07:32:25.562
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, on the profitability side,
I mean that's even better because that's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43706-1
07:32:25.562 --> 07:32:29.881
<v Ricky Horton>kind of what you can help to,
but 9 * 10 from a global perspective of</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43706-2
07:32:29.881 --> 07:32:31.917
<v Ricky Horton>project is hitting the needs for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43740-0
07:32:34.357 --> 07:32:38.613
<v Ricky Horton>I doubt, I mean,
that's like the biggest frustration a lot</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43740-1
07:32:38.613 --> 07:32:44.457
<v Ricky Horton>of times in the field is not as well as
my knowledge because there's budgets and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43740-2
07:32:44.457 --> 07:32:50.157
<v Ricky Horton>and bigger things when it comes to this,
but hitting dates like that's a huge.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43780-0
07:32:50.397 --> 07:32:53.058
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I mean and being able to forecast that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43780-1
07:32:53.058 --> 07:32:57.730
<v Ricky Horton>stuff out with our production schedule
that we have in here is going to be way</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43780-2
07:32:57.730 --> 07:33:01.397
<v Ricky Horton>helpful of this is the amount we have for
this variable work.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43780-3
07:33:01.397 --> 07:33:06.306
<v Ricky Horton>We can plan these out accordingly and and
make sure that we're able to hit what we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43780-4
07:33:06.306 --> 07:33:06.957
<v Ricky Horton>got to hit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43786-0
07:33:07.237 --> 07:33:10.957
<v Ricky Horton>Is open. So how do we?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43808-0
07:33:11.957 --> 07:33:16.488
<v Ricky Horton>How do we take some of this stuff in and
and and again,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43808-1
07:33:16.488 --> 07:33:22.477
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just thinking out loud here on how do
we come up with ways to reduce?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43858-0
07:33:23.837 --> 07:33:29.828
<v Ricky Horton>What our should be to know what we can go
and check, right? Like how do we,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43858-1
07:33:29.828 --> 07:33:36.293
<v Ricky Horton>where do we really just find some of this
stuff to break it into rails and pillar</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43858-2
07:33:36.293 --> 07:33:40.077
<v Ricky Horton>beams or cutlets that are up to all
channel to?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43894-0
07:33:40.317 --> 07:33:44.983
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
10 lbs to really start getting some true,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43894-1
07:33:44.983 --> 07:33:50.458
<v Ricky Horton>true. Yeah, well,
let me just say this from looking at what?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43894-2
07:33:50.458 --> 07:33:55.933
<v Ricky Horton>If I look at the data that we were
looking at on this, what,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43894-3
07:33:55.933 --> 07:33:57.997
<v Ricky Horton>five jobs and whatever.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43930-0
07:33:58.597 --> 07:34:01.257
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
this is like two days ago we looked at</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43930-1
07:34:01.257 --> 07:34:06.045
<v Ricky Horton>those three to five jobs and these are
the jobs that I believe were manipulated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43930-2
07:34:06.045 --> 07:34:11.011
<v Ricky Horton>The house. Somebody manipulated the house.
That's why they came in right now. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43930-3
07:34:11.011 --> 07:34:13.317
<v Ricky Horton>what job for them though? I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43972-0
07:34:14.437 --> 07:34:20.000
<v Ricky Horton>And then so you split out,
you split out two different trust rules,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43972-1
07:34:20.000 --> 07:34:26.055
<v Ricky Horton>right, two different trust rules.
So we did what was released on our shop</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/43972-2
07:34:26.055 --> 07:34:30.637
<v Ricky Horton>package and what was in the estimate in
Tekla and then.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44006-0
07:34:31.197 --> 07:34:38.592
<v Ricky Horton>What we had for a screenshot after making
our tweaks in there to try and fine tune</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44006-1
07:34:38.592 --> 07:34:44.116
<v Ricky Horton>it a little bit. And uh,
we did that for two weeks and then I</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44006-2
07:34:44.116 --> 07:34:46.077
<v Ricky Horton>think two or three of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44053-0
07:34:46.517 --> 07:34:50.490
<v Ricky Horton>But even before that,
the day before you were here on Monday,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44053-1
07:34:50.490 --> 07:34:55.361
<v Ricky Horton>isn't that the day we had Mark sitting
here and he went over three jobs and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44053-2
07:34:55.361 --> 07:34:58.950
<v Ricky Horton>those ones came out within an hour. Yeah,
yeah, it was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44053-3
07:34:58.950 --> 07:35:03.757
<v Ricky Horton>That's the ones that I saw and that's
because those have been manipulated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44087-0
07:35:04.157 --> 07:35:09.668
<v Ricky Horton>So what what I what I was comparing this
to was the budget to what Tekla is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44087-1
07:35:09.668 --> 07:35:14.817
<v Ricky Horton>because the the total the actual hours
just were too perfect. I don't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44087-2
07:35:14.817 --> 07:35:20.837
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that I would trust them but
the budget split out as opposed to Tekla.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44138-0
07:35:21.397 --> 07:35:27.224
<v Ricky Horton>Is really what I was comparing it to.
You know, going forward, I would be like,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44138-1
07:35:27.224 --> 07:35:32.323
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I won't. I'll tell you what I'll do.
You go even going backwards.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44138-2
07:35:32.323 --> 07:35:37.860
<v Ricky Horton>I'd look at everybody's total hours
compared to the hours that were applied</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44138-3
07:35:37.860 --> 07:35:39.317
<v Ricky Horton>to the job received.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44179-0
07:35:39.717 --> 07:35:42.266
<v Ricky Horton>If that,
if that that actually allows it up.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44179-1
07:35:42.266 --> 07:35:45.834
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I was running against payroll.
Yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44179-2
07:35:45.834 --> 07:35:50.026
<v Ricky Horton>I just know it gets payroll. It truly,
it truly worked hours. Yeah. Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44179-3
07:35:50.026 --> 07:35:54.274
<v Ricky Horton>that's what it makes. So the 75 agents,
if you looked at what was what was</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44179-4
07:35:54.274 --> 07:35:55.237
<v Ricky Horton>budgeted on that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44190-0
07:35:55.717 --> 07:35:58.827
<v Ricky Horton>That project,
every time a customer did a chain order,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44190-1
07:35:58.827 --> 07:36:00.637
<v Ricky Horton>we added money regardless of of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44251-0
07:36:01.957 --> 07:36:06.742
<v Ricky Horton>He, you know, did he last week, right.
Every time he had a good exercise, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44251-1
07:36:06.742 --> 07:36:10.810
<v Ricky Horton>he came on the way to sell them on this
section. That's good. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44251-2
07:36:10.810 --> 07:36:15.116
<v Ricky Horton>that's a sales perspective. Yeah,
but that shouldn't matter to to this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44251-3
07:36:15.116 --> 07:36:20.021
<v Ricky Horton>I think that we're the the block on the
budget code session on that specific job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44251-4
07:36:20.021 --> 07:36:21.517
<v Ricky Horton>I know that that one got.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44297-0
07:36:21.797 --> 07:36:26.154
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that one got sacked,
especially because the way that we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44297-1
07:36:26.154 --> 07:36:29.669
<v Ricky Horton>redesigned a lot of the connections.
But I think.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44297-2
07:36:29.669 --> 07:36:34.097
<v Ricky Horton>So there were changes for messing with
the actual. Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44297-3
07:36:34.097 --> 07:36:39.368
<v Ricky Horton>they've been around for a while. Yeah,
but what does Mark estimate off of?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44297-4
07:36:39.368 --> 07:36:41.477
<v Ricky Horton>He estimates against the shot.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44299-0
07:36:41.717 --> 07:36:42.797
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's great.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44334-0
07:36:43.877 --> 07:36:47.713
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas the estimator, well,
Mark's checking it, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44334-1
07:36:47.713 --> 07:36:51.411
<v Ricky Horton>Like you're the one that's actually doing
the damage.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44334-2
07:36:51.411 --> 07:36:57.097
<v Ricky Horton>I need to do an estimate and then me and
him are reviewing that it's good with the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44334-3
07:36:57.097 --> 07:36:59.837
<v Ricky Horton>labor or I didn't estimate enough labor.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44404-0
07:37:00.237 --> 07:37:04.030
<v Ricky Horton>And then once we're on the same page,
we then take that back.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44404-1
07:37:04.030 --> 07:37:08.313
<v Ricky Horton>And if it's within the budgets that we've
received, then that's good.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44404-2
07:37:08.313 --> 07:37:11.494
<v Ricky Horton>We push it through.
If it's outside of the budgets,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44404-3
07:37:11.494 --> 07:37:15.655
<v Ricky Horton>then then we raise a flag. Hey,
we think we're going to have a toll</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44404-4
07:37:15.655 --> 07:37:19.877
<v Ricky Horton>bridge on this one and that's when we can
get back to the estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44417-0
07:37:19.957 --> 07:37:24.213
<v Ricky Horton>And say, hey,
how is this in the estimate was something</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44417-1
07:37:24.213 --> 07:37:27.557
<v Ricky Horton>missed or are we are we high on our end
or?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44463-0
07:37:28.597 --> 07:37:33.194
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially just pre-planning so that if
if we're going to go over a certain</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44463-1
07:37:33.194 --> 07:37:37.433
<v Ricky Horton>dollar amount on the project,
at least letting the team know what over</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44463-2
07:37:37.433 --> 07:37:40.657
<v Ricky Horton>anticipated,
then obviously shooting for the original</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44463-3
07:37:40.657 --> 07:37:44.717
<v Ricky Horton>goal and pushing the guys to maintain the
original hours estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44480-0
07:37:45.037 --> 07:37:49.838
<v Ricky Horton>We can't change ordering and make up what
we're anticipating our own words to be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44480-1
07:37:49.838 --> 07:37:53.117
<v Ricky Horton>Are you on the estimator looking with the
same drawing?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44520-0
07:37:55.157 --> 07:37:58.226
<v Ricky Horton>So it it depends.
It depends on the project I know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44520-1
07:37:58.226 --> 07:38:01.296
<v Ricky Horton>Probably not.
Normally we have to be looking at the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44520-2
07:38:01.296 --> 07:38:04.602
<v Ricky Horton>design drawings and these guys are
looking at the shop,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44520-3
07:38:04.602 --> 07:38:07.672
<v Ricky Horton>'cause that's where the other difference
is, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44520-4
07:38:07.672 --> 07:38:09.797
<v Ricky Horton>This design may have made it easier.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44521-0
07:38:10.957 --> 07:38:13.517
<v Ricky Horton>These are all.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44544-0
07:38:14.997 --> 07:38:19.921
<v Ricky Horton>Anyway, it's different. Tell about that.
Yeah, well, it is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44544-1
07:38:19.921 --> 07:38:24.517
<v Ricky Horton>And that's them fascinating. That's right.
The idea is.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44608-0
07:38:25.557 --> 07:38:28.980
<v Ricky Horton>That is,
is the real big exercise is identifying</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44608-1
07:38:28.980 --> 07:38:33.451
<v Ricky Horton>up front, right? It's the idea here.
It's identifying up front.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44608-2
07:38:33.451 --> 07:38:38.411
<v Ricky Horton>We have an issue to where we can,
you know, it's not at the end of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44608-3
07:38:38.411 --> 07:38:42.043
<v Ricky Horton>We're forecasting. That's the big thing.
We fix it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44608-4
07:38:42.043 --> 07:38:45.397
<v Ricky Horton>do something different to save the job
exactly.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44659-0
07:38:45.597 --> 07:38:48.703
<v Ricky Horton>Or or like them,
like what they're saying is it comes in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44659-1
07:38:48.703 --> 07:38:52.735
<v Ricky Horton>under is actually only until you know
it's only planned from a production</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44659-2
07:38:52.735 --> 07:38:56.603
<v Ricky Horton>standpoint that we're only gonna need
three days worth of work, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44659-3
07:38:56.603 --> 07:39:01.017
<v Ricky Horton>And that's where like really forecasting
that aspect of it and not going into it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44659-4
07:39:01.017 --> 07:39:03.197
<v Ricky Horton>thinking and getting played hours where.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44694-0
07:39:03.637 --> 07:39:07.532
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I, you know,
the guys want to now have, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44694-1
07:39:07.532 --> 07:39:12.436
<v Ricky Horton>five days to do it and they should
actually be pushing still get 3,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44694-2
07:39:12.436 --> 07:39:17.197
<v Ricky Horton>but I don't want to work on two guys in
the back. So here you go.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44727-0
07:39:18.197 --> 07:39:23.553
<v Ricky Horton>I'd almost not to.
I'd almost not want to tell the shop how</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44727-1
07:39:23.553 --> 07:39:30.784
<v Ricky Horton>many budgeted hours we have for the next
three to six months and then run it and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44727-2
07:39:30.784 --> 07:39:37.837
<v Ricky Horton>see what it comes out to be and then
compare it to the estimated and adjusted.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44729-0
07:39:38.117 --> 07:39:42.877
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44773-0
07:39:43.717 --> 07:39:47.841
<v Ricky Horton>Yep. When you give them hours,
people are going to come up with a way to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44773-1
07:39:47.841 --> 07:39:51.965
<v Ricky Horton>cheat. They're going to say, oh, yeah,
I'm going to go over on this job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44773-2
07:39:51.965 --> 07:39:56.202
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm going to take some of those.
I mean for the job because I think I'm</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44773-3
07:39:56.202 --> 07:40:00.157
<v Ricky Horton>going to do that because I can see it in
the system too easily. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44776-0
07:40:00.677 --> 07:40:02.517
<v Ricky Horton>But I bet they can go to here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44783-0
07:40:03.477 --> 07:40:08.317
<v Ricky Horton>I just think templates you could make
changes, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44785-0
07:40:09.797 --> 07:40:10.677
<v Ricky Horton>I don't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44787-0
07:40:13.597 --> 07:40:14.157
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44824-0
07:40:17.597 --> 07:40:23.876
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think you're you're you're you're
terrible.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44824-1
07:40:23.876 --> 07:40:31.242
<v Ricky Horton>I don't like the swings I'm I'm seeing
with what I had here,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44824-2
07:40:31.242 --> 07:40:36.677
<v Ricky Horton>but I don't know that I trusted that
enough.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44881-0
07:40:36.717 --> 07:40:42.017
<v Ricky Horton>I mean a couple years worth of jobs.
I mean just three or four of the five.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44881-1
07:40:42.017 --> 07:40:47.666
<v Ricky Horton>So the the the hours haven't really been
changed. We not oath have been changed.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44881-2
07:40:47.666 --> 07:40:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>I think what we did was fine,
but like the e-mail and stuff is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44881-3
07:40:52.060 --> 07:40:53.037
<v Ricky Horton>generally not.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44908-0
07:40:53.117 --> 07:41:00.505
<v Ricky Horton>It's true, not too far out in left field.
So if it felt like it was OK, good to me,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44908-1
07:41:00.505 --> 07:41:06.926
<v Ricky Horton>I would just keep running with it,
but get some really good data to come</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44908-2
07:41:06.926 --> 07:41:09.917
<v Ricky Horton>back and change it. Yeah, I agree.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44927-0
07:41:10.157 --> 07:41:13.607
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I'm not scared of being.
I'll I'll try.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44927-1
07:41:13.607 --> 07:41:19.724
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't be scared to run with it,
but let me why don't you just call check</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44927-2
07:41:19.724 --> 07:41:24.037
<v Ricky Horton>and see if I can use it and then but you
but you have.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44935-0
07:41:24.757 --> 07:41:29.297
<v Ricky Horton>But there's just, OK,
so I you know the consistency was what we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44935-1
07:41:29.297 --> 07:41:32.277
<v Ricky Horton>got there so far making decisions on that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44955-0
07:41:41.797 --> 07:41:50.277
<v Ricky Horton>With the change to our versus plan hours
or base hours with production.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44986-0
07:41:52.677 --> 07:41:58.588
<v Ricky Horton>We can inform our leads on base hours
instead of originally estimated and give</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44986-1
07:41:58.588 --> 07:42:04.200
<v Ricky Horton>them a goal below what was actually
estimated and see if they can hit that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/44986-2
07:42:04.200 --> 07:42:07.717
<v Ricky Horton>goal and if they can't then because right
now.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45032-0
07:42:07.797 --> 07:42:12.313
<v Ricky Horton>We're plastering a big board of the shop.
This is how many hours you have for this,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45032-1
07:42:12.313 --> 07:42:16.830
<v Ricky Horton>this is how many hours you have for this,
this is how many hours you have for this.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45032-2
07:42:16.830 --> 07:42:21.346
<v Ricky Horton>So we undercut that goal and we're always
shooting for something slightly less than</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45032-3
07:42:21.346 --> 07:42:25.379
<v Ricky Horton>what we have as long as we know that
we're covered budget wise with what's</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45032-4
07:42:25.379 --> 07:42:25.917
<v Ricky Horton>estimated.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45071-0
07:42:26.117 --> 07:42:30.789
<v Ricky Horton>Then it don't matter what we're telling
them they have to do it in. Yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45071-1
07:42:30.789 --> 07:42:34.514
<v Ricky Horton>And then maybe pushing them to what they
have to do it in.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45071-2
07:42:34.514 --> 07:42:39.438
<v Ricky Horton>And then from there it's it's either
unachievable or it's or you can actually</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45071-3
07:42:39.438 --> 07:42:43.037
<v Ricky Horton>buzz to get it done. Yeah.
So because that's definitely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45102-0
07:42:43.237 --> 07:42:47.475
<v Ricky Horton>And then and we can do that in work
packages too,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45102-1
07:42:47.475 --> 07:42:53.407
<v Ricky Horton>but I think at the end of the day take
out the the motivation factor,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45102-2
07:42:53.407 --> 07:42:58.917
<v Ricky Horton>right this we as as from a a management
standpoint have to know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45150-0
07:42:58.917 --> 07:43:03.563
<v Ricky Horton>What actions are, right? Mm-hmm.
There's so many times that estimators</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45150-1
07:43:03.563 --> 07:43:09.060
<v Ricky Horton>they just get and you start going through
this like I have no idea of all the where</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45150-2
07:43:09.060 --> 07:43:14.295
<v Ricky Horton>like you start plugging stuff in and you
have no idea of what your true actions</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45150-3
07:43:14.295 --> 07:43:14.557
<v Ricky Horton>was.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45183-0
07:43:14.837 --> 07:43:20.297
<v Ricky Horton>Or we have to we have to get some sort of
comfortability of what can the shop</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45183-1
07:43:20.297 --> 07:43:24.637
<v Ricky Horton>actually do, right?
And that's a few of the date when we self</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45183-2
07:43:24.637 --> 07:43:29.607
<v Ricky Horton>motivate for like what it is,
but we have to get comfortable with what</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45183-3
07:43:29.607 --> 07:43:31.357
<v Ricky Horton>can the shop actually do.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45216-0
07:43:31.557 --> 07:43:37.331
<v Ricky Horton>Right then it just goes into,
I mean it's it's a big picture of when</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45216-1
07:43:37.331 --> 07:43:42.687
<v Ricky Horton>you know we're bidding at 16,
000 times so W 44 version, right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45216-2
07:43:42.687 --> 07:43:48.797
<v Ricky Horton>So I what can we actually do, right?
Can we do 1000, you know, times of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45249-0
07:43:49.557 --> 07:43:52.173
<v Ricky Horton>Month like what?
But after everybody's gotta get</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45249-1
07:43:52.173 --> 07:43:55.590
<v Ricky Horton>comfortable, I think the sales side,
I mean everything. I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45249-2
07:43:55.590 --> 07:43:58.579
<v Ricky Horton>that's the easy side.
But then we want to deal with it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45249-3
07:43:58.579 --> 07:44:02.477
<v Ricky Horton>But we need to get comfortable with what
can we actually do, right? Yep.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45279-0
07:44:03.797 --> 07:44:08.879
<v Ricky Horton>And then as soon as you start,
you start budgeting things and getting</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45279-1
07:44:08.879 --> 07:44:14.978
<v Ricky Horton>away from, you know, what we can sell for,
it gets very confusing here and you lose</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45279-2
07:44:14.978 --> 07:44:19.117
<v Ricky Horton>sight of like what our main actual
production goals are.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45292-0
07:44:21.397 --> 07:44:27.677
<v Ricky Horton>So that's 16,000 W 44, I think so. Yeah,
calls were W four.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45330-0
07:44:28.557 --> 07:44:33.390
<v Ricky Horton>Don't remember. They're big.
Did we didn't see Boulder,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45330-1
07:44:33.390 --> 07:44:39.950
<v Ricky Horton>but I just over and saw them and it was
the, yeah, they're W 44 by team 17,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45330-2
07:44:39.950 --> 07:44:43.317
<v Ricky Horton>that production theme that you can get.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45368-0
07:44:43.717 --> 07:44:47.811
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
And then we and then we side one inch</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45368-1
07:44:47.811 --> 07:44:51.511
<v Ricky Horton>breaks here here and then we had field
slices,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45368-2
07:44:51.511 --> 07:44:56.865
<v Ricky Horton>multiple field slices because they were
maybe we were like 74 feet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45368-3
07:44:56.865 --> 07:45:03.086
<v Ricky Horton>So we have a we have like a 50 something
footer to level 2 and then we have 16</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45368-4
07:45:03.086 --> 07:45:03.637
<v Ricky Horton>footer.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45371-0
07:45:03.717 --> 07:45:07.517
<v Ricky Horton>On top of it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45374-0
07:45:09.117 --> 07:45:10.797
<v Ricky Horton>Read the schedule.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45417-0
07:45:12.037 --> 07:45:15.952
<v Ricky Horton>Barely looked at the schedule as you get
drawings in November,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45417-1
07:45:15.952 --> 07:45:20.490
<v Ricky Horton>you get them delivered in March.
You have to deliver 7000 tons in March.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45417-2
07:45:20.490 --> 07:45:24.219
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I don't even know if they're coded.
If they're coded,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45417-3
07:45:24.219 --> 07:45:28.197
<v Ricky Horton>they probably need the coding. Yeah,
that would be interesting.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45422-0
07:45:28.437 --> 07:45:32.197
<v Ricky Horton>Something that they probably just fired
for that point.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45425-0
07:45:33.077 --> 07:45:35.117
<v Ricky Horton>Who owns the last one?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45445-0
07:45:36.317 --> 07:45:44.273
<v Ricky Horton>The estimator or the GC? The estimator?
I think it's probably usually the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45445-1
07:45:44.273 --> 07:45:51.477
<v Ricky Horton>structure and stuff smart. I don't know.
She's probably here, but.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45457-0
07:45:52.077 --> 07:45:58.666
<v Ricky Horton>So are you going to start using the Um
original estimated hours instead of the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45457-1
07:45:58.666 --> 07:45:58.917
<v Ricky Horton>Um?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-0
07:45:59.877 --> 07:46:03.338
<v Ricky Horton>Adjustment. That makes sense. Yeah,
we'll make that change. Jimmy,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-1
07:46:03.338 --> 07:46:05.869
<v Ricky Horton>what are you leaving here?
What am I doing here?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-2
07:46:05.869 --> 07:46:09.485
<v Ricky Horton>What are you leaving here?
I need to get going here in a few minutes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-3
07:46:09.485 --> 07:46:12.688
<v Ricky Horton>I figured you might.
You and I should have a quick talk about</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-4
07:46:12.688 --> 07:46:15.839
<v Ricky Horton>that 22 o'clock job.
There's too many people saying it's not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-5
07:46:15.839 --> 07:46:18.628
<v Ricky Horton>my job. Oh yeah,
I have a feeling you're the decision</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45505-6
07:46:18.628 --> 07:46:19.197
<v Ricky Horton>maker here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45532-0
07:46:19.717 --> 07:46:24.174
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to see.
I was the person that's gonna ask some</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45532-1
07:46:24.174 --> 07:46:30.414
<v Ricky Horton>questions. Anyway, Jeff has the coupons,
just so you know, right? So he's got them.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45532-2
07:46:30.414 --> 07:46:34.277
<v Ricky Horton>He just doesn't know what to do with them.
So yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45571-0
07:46:34.837 --> 07:46:37.494
<v Ricky Horton>I would say if if no one's gonna make a
decision,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45571-1
07:46:37.494 --> 07:46:41.320
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say we we match the prep of the
actual fitment that we're gonna do,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45571-2
07:46:41.320 --> 07:46:45.412
<v Ricky Horton>which is just a single edge, right?
And then running as a TG and calling it,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45571-3
07:46:45.412 --> 07:46:49.557
<v Ricky Horton>that's what you guys are gonna do in the
field, right? Are they gonna get it?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45577-0
07:46:50.197 --> 07:46:54.224
<v Ricky Horton>I don't wanna. Are we done with this?
Maybe you and I have a little side</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45577-1
07:46:54.224 --> 07:46:54.997
<v Ricky Horton>sidebar, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45634-0
07:46:55.877 --> 07:47:01.939
<v Ricky Horton>What's global actions for tomorrow is I'm
gonna take. I have the Excel spreadsheet.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45634-1
07:47:01.939 --> 07:47:06.558
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna take and manipulate that to
match what we have. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45634-2
07:47:06.558 --> 07:47:09.806
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna figure out how to once we can
fix.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45634-3
07:47:09.806 --> 07:47:15.436
<v Ricky Horton>So I will do practice any work on that.
Then I would say another action items</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45634-4
07:47:15.436 --> 07:47:15.797
<v Ricky Horton>like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45669-0
07:47:15.877 --> 07:47:21.269
<v Ricky Horton>I said coming up with some some metric
and some way to start grouping these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45669-1
07:47:21.269 --> 07:47:27.088
<v Ricky Horton>things to get bigger because when we long
long time with one of the approaches we</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45669-2
07:47:27.088 --> 07:47:32.197
<v Ricky Horton>had is is you group a cut list on and and
even if you group a cut list.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45672-0
07:47:32.637 --> 07:47:33.717
<v Ricky Horton>And you say, OK.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-0
07:47:34.677 --> 07:47:37.509
<v Ricky Horton>From here,
it's enough parts that it's a good sample</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-1
07:47:37.509 --> 07:47:41.838
<v Ricky Horton>that we're going to keep talking about.
Just have them get it right on the paper</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-2
07:47:41.838 --> 07:47:45.045
<v Ricky Horton>and just say, hey,
I started at I started at 8:03 and I got</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-3
07:47:45.045 --> 07:47:48.412
<v Ricky Horton>done at 10:15, right?
And then it something that can come back</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-4
07:47:48.412 --> 07:47:52.420
<v Ricky Horton>and release some stacks of paper,
something can come back and you can have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45731-5
07:47:52.420 --> 07:47:54.077
<v Ricky Horton>some, you know you guys report.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45762-0
07:47:54.197 --> 07:47:58.625
<v Ricky Horton>I've done this the whole time.
Then you can take you to buy that out and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45762-1
07:47:58.625 --> 07:48:01.537
<v Ricky Horton>say, OK,
on this tell list there are 75 pieces.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45762-2
07:48:01.537 --> 07:48:05.723
<v Ricky Horton>The guy took 94 minutes. You can check it.
So the basic fetch. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45762-3
07:48:05.723 --> 07:48:08.757
<v Ricky Horton>well and and tomorrow too,
whenever you get that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45799-0
07:48:09.797 --> 07:48:13.716
<v Ricky Horton>We'll import it in.
I think it would be kind of critical for</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45799-1
07:48:13.716 --> 07:48:18.342
<v Ricky Horton>us to run it through, purchase it,
do a cut list, process the cut list,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45799-2
07:48:18.342 --> 07:48:23.160
<v Ricky Horton>do the receiving just to make sure
there's no other hiccups somewhere else</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45799-3
07:48:23.160 --> 07:48:26.437
<v Ricky Horton>that are income or just something lasting
another.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45827-0
07:48:26.677 --> 07:48:30.343
<v Ricky Horton>We can run through that pretty quickly
though,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45827-1
07:48:30.343 --> 07:48:34.244
<v Ricky Horton>but that's what I would expect to be.
Yeah, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45827-2
07:48:34.244 --> 07:48:39.080
<v Ricky Horton>everything I've got was since the start
of the stop planning.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45827-3
07:48:39.080 --> 07:48:42.357
<v Ricky Horton>It's all all the EPMU. You have to see it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45852-0
07:48:42.917 --> 07:48:49.843
<v Ricky Horton>I like that. Well, this is maybe, I think,
I think too. I mean, yeah, get a fire.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45852-1
07:48:49.843 --> 07:48:56.094
<v Ricky Horton>If your projects are in there,
I don't know. I'm sorry, stop and I can't.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45852-2
07:48:56.094 --> 07:48:58.797
<v Ricky Horton>We're just never able to really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45873-0
07:48:59.077 --> 07:49:05.390
<v Ricky Horton>We put more on a good job.
We can only help you. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45873-1
07:49:05.390 --> 07:49:14.917
<v Ricky Horton>that's not the single back release they
have. They have. We've been jobs. Details.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45873-2
07:49:14.917 --> 07:49:17.557
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45909-0
07:49:17.677 --> 07:49:23.386
<v Ricky Horton>We'll do it on the 40th plan.
So we're we're doing two piece of stack,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45909-1
07:49:23.386 --> 07:49:27.246
<v Ricky Horton>right?
And so they're going to listen to a back</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45909-2
07:49:27.246 --> 07:49:33.197
<v Ricky Horton>in bar. Let's assume, yes, they did.
They are actually. They're going to.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45947-0
07:49:33.237 --> 07:49:38.720
<v Ricky Horton>So I think that's easy.
While the outside there's going to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45947-1
07:49:38.720 --> 07:49:44.381
<v Ricky Horton>guys. We're just doing on that one.
We're going to pre-install.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45947-2
07:49:44.381 --> 07:49:49.157
<v Ricky Horton>Is it pre-installed?
I think it's coming to this job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45968-0
07:49:49.277 --> 07:50:03.871
<v Ricky Horton>Bars 29 sections, you know,
we just continue to share.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/45968-1
07:50:03.871 --> 07:50:08.117
<v Ricky Horton>I think the way.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46016-0
07:50:08.997 --> 07:50:13.820
<v Ricky Horton>Because they put the Alaska that on the
inside or to have to reassize this</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46016-1
07:50:13.820 --> 07:50:19.223
<v Ricky Horton>process to Jeff, because it's been true.
Remember what I was saying at the meeting?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46016-2
07:50:19.223 --> 07:50:24.304
<v Ricky Horton>Hopefully they would use it to keep that
at home and the biggest thing like it</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46016-3
07:50:24.304 --> 07:50:26.877
<v Ricky Horton>would just slide in to be a perfect fit.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46065-0
07:50:27.237 --> 07:50:31.916
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, then you gotta come off at the end.
You got a back end part there.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46065-1
07:50:31.916 --> 07:50:36.661
<v Ricky Horton>It's all that one is good to actually
release today. That's connection.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46065-2
07:50:36.661 --> 07:50:40.022
<v Ricky Horton>I don't get it the because like these
hours. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46065-3
07:50:40.022 --> 07:50:44.240
<v Ricky Horton>I was giving you a text together because
see what's the inside.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46065-4
07:50:44.240 --> 07:50:46.877
<v Ricky Horton>I wonder all this stuff that's gonna be.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46096-0
07:50:47.117 --> 07:50:51.094
<v Ricky Horton>OK, the I gotta wait 48 hours.
So it's better.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46096-1
07:50:51.094 --> 07:50:57.780
<v Ricky Horton>So we reached out to the customer. Yeah,
that's one way now we had some rooms.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46096-2
07:50:57.780 --> 07:51:03.197
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that you want to.
I guess it was within two hours.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46131-0
07:51:03.837 --> 07:51:09.922
<v Ricky Horton>So we have two pieces.
We'll take out a huge lifts and the guy</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46131-1
07:51:09.922 --> 07:51:17.262
<v Ricky Horton>just walks here and the development
understood it and then it's done. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46131-2
07:51:17.262 --> 07:51:23.637
<v Ricky Horton>so I guess what you want me to take,
why don't you say it's done.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46167-0
07:51:24.197 --> 07:51:39.050
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to have an actual perspective,
Kenya, because right here with the shop,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46167-1
07:51:39.050 --> 07:51:43.117
<v Ricky Horton>I grew up in the shops.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46195-0
07:51:44.197 --> 07:52:02.397
<v Ricky Horton>That's all I've done is 45 years, right?
So I can estimate, right?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46221-0
07:52:03.397 --> 07:52:08.062
<v Ricky Horton>So then all this, yeah, you can.
If you see it every day out there,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46221-1
07:52:08.062 --> 07:52:11.630
<v Ricky Horton>it's right.
It's so they have just most of you have</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46221-2
07:52:11.630 --> 07:52:15.541
<v Ricky Horton>to have it in fact,
because there's just another crunch.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46221-3
07:52:15.541 --> 07:52:20.824
<v Ricky Horton>There's recounts. I just put that back.
We just give a good day to work out.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46221-4
07:52:20.824 --> 07:52:23.157
<v Ricky Horton>We'll think that here that that's.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46254-0
07:52:23.237 --> 07:52:32.982
<v Ricky Horton>So that's one of the thing that if not
time studies and all that side load in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46254-1
07:52:32.982 --> 07:52:42.477
<v Ricky Horton>there essentially need to have getting
some has to be started getting some.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46266-0
07:52:43.037 --> 07:52:52.173
<v Ricky Horton>It's a good clearance, like having a shot.
I don't sure it's it's on. OK,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46266-1
07:52:52.173 --> 07:52:58.717
<v Ricky Horton>that's great.
I don't know the program you're using.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46289-0
07:52:59.197 --> 07:53:15.397
<v Ricky Horton>It's hot. We really do that.
I'll have that. I'll have that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46330-0
07:53:16.637 --> 07:53:21.591
<v Ricky Horton>But I think it would also be he's have
the view for the next, yeah. And I think,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46330-1
07:53:21.591 --> 07:53:25.261
<v Ricky Horton>you know, I think we have that.
I'm actually about another.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46330-2
07:53:25.261 --> 07:53:28.870
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't really shot something,
but the other ones, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46330-3
07:53:28.870 --> 07:53:33.030
<v Ricky Horton>I think I'll get the screen,
but then how do you find that the wall</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46330-4
07:53:33.030 --> 07:53:34.437
<v Ricky Horton>last chair is one that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46370-0
07:53:34.837 --> 07:53:38.334
<v Ricky Horton>The ones that they're not to be scout the
whole way up,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46370-1
07:53:38.334 --> 07:53:43.204
<v Ricky Horton>trying to get their others direction side
of the business. Yeah, all of that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46370-2
07:53:43.204 --> 07:53:48.450
<v Ricky Horton>They believe it's still all the cost that
we learned something about the same site.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46370-3
07:53:48.450 --> 07:53:53.320
<v Ricky Horton>They really like it except for you guys
to feed on this stuff so that they're</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46370-4
07:53:53.320 --> 07:53:54.757
<v Ricky Horton>always put on that the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46391-0
07:53:54.757 --> 07:54:02.071
<v Ricky Horton>All the structural grounds,
that's what we actually call the three</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46391-1
07:54:02.071 --> 07:54:09.386
<v Ricky Horton>direction that we have six.
We're all in the same program to exile</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46391-2
07:54:09.386 --> 07:54:13.317
<v Ricky Horton>and then actually start applying it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46421-0
07:54:13.757 --> 07:54:32.997
<v Ricky Horton>Shaw was all in the. We actually, well,
and then you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46453-0
07:54:33.077 --> 07:54:39.593
<v Ricky Horton>So he's never different. I'm excited.
You're not going to be waiting,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46453-1
07:54:39.593 --> 07:54:45.643
<v Ricky Horton>especially the operation.
Who screwed it up? You know, I'm I am.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46453-2
07:54:45.643 --> 07:54:52.997
<v Ricky Horton>So they're not just fall into this.
I think 3 sixteens and there's our recent.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46460-0
07:54:53.077 --> 07:54:59.962
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's going to be contracting with the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46460-1
07:54:59.962 --> 07:55:12.637
<v Ricky Horton>shop lines, but you've got to fix the,
you know, I mean, if you, if you, if you.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46495-0
07:55:12.837 --> 07:55:24.514
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's all. I think that's all.
All these savings,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46495-1
07:55:24.514 --> 07:55:31.837
<v Ricky Horton>they're going to install a structure.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46530-0
07:55:32.517 --> 07:55:37.211
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, New York Times. Oh,
these things today. But it's balance.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46530-1
07:55:37.211 --> 07:55:41.602
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure archives put up, put up, right?
New York Times.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46530-2
07:55:41.602 --> 07:55:45.009
<v Ricky Horton>So we're putting up 50 minutes a day.
Great.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46530-3
07:55:45.009 --> 07:55:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>So we know that we have a system that can
use that, right? It's a seal.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46530-4
07:55:50.460 --> 07:55:52.277
<v Ricky Horton>It's a little different.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46559-0
07:55:52.357 --> 07:55:59.894
<v Ricky Horton>The way we do, yeah,
they're gonna hang him in last time. I,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46559-1
07:55:59.894 --> 07:56:07.555
<v Ricky Horton>you know, talking to Andre.
I think that they're gonna, yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46559-2
07:56:07.555 --> 07:56:10.397
<v Ricky Horton>it's gonna run the job.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46576-0
07:56:10.677 --> 07:56:19.957
<v Ricky Horton>Our skills, the new.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46600-0
07:56:30.197 --> 07:56:37.066
<v Ricky Horton>I guess the department will get enough
penetration to do it and this department</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46600-1
07:56:37.066 --> 07:56:41.015
<v Ricky Horton>it's hanging apart.
Did the exact same thing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46600-2
07:56:41.015 --> 07:56:45.223
<v Ricky Horton>We are consulted.
I think we have two guys to be</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46600-3
07:56:45.223 --> 07:56:50.117
<v Ricky Horton>responsible and then that's what happens
if not if like.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46637-0
07:56:50.157 --> 07:57:00.521
<v Ricky Horton>If we don't have to do any justifications,
why the exterior? Well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46637-1
07:57:00.521 --> 07:57:09.957
<v Ricky Horton>I think we should stick with what the
environment condition.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46661-0
07:57:10.037 --> 07:57:12.406
<v Ricky Horton>So I haven't listened to the schedule.
Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46661-1
07:57:12.406 --> 07:57:16.512
<v Ricky Horton>it's still maybe having similar like a
question. We start reading everywhere.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46661-2
07:57:16.512 --> 07:57:19.881
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see everything else here.
Let's do it in here. Well then,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46661-3
07:57:19.881 --> 07:57:23.566
<v Ricky Horton>where we're looking at now,
we're supposed to stay. Let's do it. Yep.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46661-4
07:57:23.566 --> 07:57:26.357
<v Ricky Horton>You can't really see the permanent place
to involve.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46670-0
07:57:26.437 --> 07:57:42.517
<v Ricky Horton>So I think we're just going to end up
wasting. Yeah. So nice. OK, I'll take it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46716-0
07:57:42.837 --> 07:57:45.988
<v Ricky Horton>I want to tell you both 77.
We have really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46716-1
07:57:45.988 --> 07:57:51.503
<v Ricky Horton>I'm 64 and I haven't been here to figure
out the process, but we may end up,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46716-2
07:57:51.503 --> 07:57:56.230
<v Ricky Horton>you know, you're better than me.
That's what I said last morning.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46716-3
07:57:56.230 --> 07:58:01.889
<v Ricky Horton>I wish I knew we could just go see.
So on the on the interior, the same. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46716-4
07:58:01.889 --> 07:58:02.677
<v Ricky Horton>definitely.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46742-0
07:58:02.837 --> 07:58:06.784
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, guys,
I'll but you need a lot of people got fat</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46742-1
07:58:06.784 --> 07:58:11.664
<v Ricky Horton>and that's a couple of days.
I'm a lot of staff to say that this is</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46742-2
07:58:11.664 --> 07:58:16.759
<v Ricky Horton>what we have to do is just what the guys
can do and that's where yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46742-3
07:58:16.759 --> 07:58:22.357
<v Ricky Horton>my my opinion on this and I probably
won't pessimism everybody. That's right.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46775-0
07:58:22.597 --> 07:58:22.757
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46789-0
07:58:23.157 --> 07:58:26.432
<v Ricky Horton>I see. I see.
Let's get eyes on the portions and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46789-1
07:58:26.432 --> 07:58:30.376
<v Ricky Horton>understand the portion of the really look
I lost a lot of.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46789-2
07:58:30.376 --> 07:58:35.657
<v Ricky Horton>I like hearing the media doing this on
the and I think that maybe we've looked</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46789-3
07:58:35.657 --> 07:58:39.266
<v Ricky Horton>at what's possible.
I think it's currently analyzing.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46789-4
07:58:39.266 --> 07:58:43.077
<v Ricky Horton>It's something that's, yeah,
and ultimately we need the.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46830-0
07:58:43.597 --> 07:58:48.011
<v Ricky Horton>Design it to say that that's a lot
possible. There's a lot of,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46830-1
07:58:48.011 --> 07:58:52.566
<v Ricky Horton>there's a lot of stress on this one.
That's right. Well, I mean,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46830-2
07:58:52.566 --> 07:58:56.840
<v Ricky Horton>the steel weld is so much as I have.
I think it's with that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46830-3
07:58:56.840 --> 07:59:01.325
<v Ricky Horton>They got to think about the throws into
this bolt. Just got it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46830-4
07:59:01.325 --> 07:59:03.077
<v Ricky Horton>This is sort of the same.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46862-0
07:59:03.157 --> 07:59:17.974
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, oh, we have. Yeah,
it works in there. I don't know.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46862-1
07:59:17.974 --> 07:59:22.317
<v Ricky Horton>I'm doing it for.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46910-0
07:59:22.997 --> 07:59:27.056
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I still,
I've lost my spend hours and I've seen</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46910-1
07:59:27.056 --> 07:59:31.791
<v Ricky Horton>this and I still take something just by
that. But I can still,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46910-2
07:59:31.791 --> 07:59:37.203
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get that one day. I can get me ID,
whatever the hell I want. Yeah,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46910-3
07:59:37.203 --> 07:59:41.037
<v Ricky Horton>here it is next week, I think.
It's basically bad.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46923-0
07:59:41.117 --> 07:59:45.762
<v Ricky Horton>But I think regardless,
I'm a fan of take one of all these</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46923-1
07:59:45.762 --> 07:59:51.116
<v Ricky Horton>lunches we've had here this night.
I have to sit here and have that</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46923-2
07:59:51.116 --> 07:59:57.573
<v Ricky Horton>environment and then we can dive in it,
you know, but next weekend we'll make it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46923-3
07:59:57.573 --> 07:59:58.597
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46948-0
07:59:58.837 --> 08:00:10.402
<v Ricky Horton>I usually, I don't, I don't,
but it's a different you are in</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46948-1
08:00:10.402 --> 08:00:17.797
<v Ricky Horton>particularly. So my opinion is is that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46974-0
08:00:18.797 --> 08:00:26.805
<v Ricky Horton>And the loan process is not I'm weeks
right now because how do we go into the</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46974-1
08:00:26.805 --> 08:00:34.197
<v Ricky Horton>one and I think we're in your point to do
this on the ground versus not</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/46974-2
08:00:34.197 --> 08:00:37.277
<v Ricky Horton>understanding how we actually.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47003-0
08:00:37.717 --> 08:00:44.883
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I think that I think we need
to understand. Now I've started working.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47003-1
08:00:44.883 --> 08:00:51.875
<v Ricky Horton>I switched over to the pickleball out
here in my wife and then we say I'm going</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47003-2
08:00:51.875 --> 08:00:55.197
<v Ricky Horton>to call you pick them up to last year.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47045-0
08:00:55.957 --> 08:01:00.052
<v Ricky Horton>It's not very good.
I've been playing basketball for it.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47045-1
08:01:00.052 --> 08:01:04.651
<v Ricky Horton>That's what 5040 years.
I started when I was 10 and I'd like to</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47045-2
08:01:04.651 --> 08:01:09.321
<v Ricky Horton>see you got the pros here.
They got a leach and then I think I'm</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47045-3
08:01:09.321 --> 08:01:14.854
<v Ricky Horton>going to have between the lead days.
My son and I asked to play and love can</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47045-4
08:01:14.854 --> 08:01:15.357
<v Ricky Horton>really.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47079-0
08:01:15.437 --> 08:01:20.652
<v Ricky Horton>We have at least documents to talk about
just like second and we were looking at a</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47079-1
08:01:20.652 --> 08:01:25.491
<v Ricky Horton>little bit last year to like third or
four events and I and this is the leap</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47079-2
08:01:25.491 --> 08:01:30.141
<v Ricky Horton>level just for the pro, the pro level.
I don't know these guys know that,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47079-3
08:01:30.141 --> 08:01:34.917
<v Ricky Horton>but then I brought them all to pick a
ball and have a hell of a time trend.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47106-0
08:01:34.997 --> 08:01:41.169
<v Ricky Horton>I've not used my wrist. I mean, yeah,
yeah, I mean it's. Yeah, pick a ball.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47106-1
08:01:41.169 --> 08:01:47.260
<v Ricky Horton>You can't use your wrist very much.
You have to get the back end for that.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47106-2
08:01:47.260 --> 08:01:51.077
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, you have to flick. Yeah,
so it goes.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47140-0
08:01:51.077 --> 08:01:56.261
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's been bowling. That's fun too.
That's I think when I was younger and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47140-1
08:01:56.261 --> 08:02:00.677
<v Ricky Horton>then I moved out here and and have I
don't have any family out here.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47140-2
08:02:00.677 --> 08:02:05.797
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't have a lot of friends like that
was work here. So I joined the league.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47184-0
08:02:06.517 --> 08:02:11.829
<v Ricky Horton>And sell it on a team and sell it on
another team. Oh, there you go. See,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47184-1
08:02:11.829 --> 08:02:17.501
<v Ricky Horton>I used to ride a motorcycle here too.
And and I ended up selling my motorcycle</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47184-2
08:02:17.501 --> 08:02:23.317
<v Ricky Horton>because both of my parents said go get a
500 horsepower car. I don't care. Just.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47219-0
08:02:23.437 --> 08:02:28.464
<v Ricky Horton>Don't have a motorcycle. Oh, well,
I don't ride. I don't ride. I ride both.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47219-1
08:02:28.464 --> 08:02:33.094
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I ride little 250 on the river.
Nice single track. I'm a *****.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47219-2
08:02:33.094 --> 08:02:37.129
<v Ricky Horton>So I ride actually the double track or
Forest Service roads.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47219-3
08:02:37.129 --> 08:02:40.437
<v Ricky Horton>I got to give the single track.
That's not gonna.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47254-0
08:02:40.757 --> 08:02:46.263
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I did single check back home. I was,
I used that all the time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47254-1
08:02:46.263 --> 08:02:52.567
<v Ricky Horton>That was back when I was in the shop.
I was a welder and I'd do a single check</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47254-2
08:02:52.567 --> 08:02:56.477
<v Ricky Horton>back in the morning and then also dirt
bike and.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47296-0
08:02:56.917 --> 08:03:01.923
<v Ricky Horton>And then the workout and that's my beans
and early 20s.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47296-1
08:03:01.923 --> 08:03:08.092
<v Ricky Horton>So now it's now it's all the man sports,
not even bowling. How many?</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47296-2
08:03:08.092 --> 08:03:13.277
<v Ricky Horton>I think that was the fitness I was in for
like in my 30s.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47301-0
08:03:14.477 --> 08:03:18.325
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah, I mean,
I I raced bicycles for all through</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47301-1
08:03:18.325 --> 08:03:18.917
<v Ricky Horton>college.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47344-0
08:03:19.877 --> 08:03:24.830
<v Ricky Horton>I got pretty sick and you can't give it
up otherwise you die. Yeah, well,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47344-1
08:03:24.830 --> 08:03:28.713
<v Ricky Horton>in like bowling,
I guess bowling is the only things work,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47344-2
08:03:28.713 --> 08:03:32.930
<v Ricky Horton>but when I'm bowling,
like majority of my friends and majority</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47344-3
08:03:32.930 --> 08:03:36.077
<v Ricky Horton>of the people I bowl with are my parents'
age.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47383-0
08:03:36.357 --> 08:03:40.516
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like hanging out with a bunch of old
people and I don't,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47383-1
08:03:40.516 --> 08:03:44.334
<v Ricky Horton>so I like hanging out with them and
having a good time.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47383-2
08:03:44.334 --> 08:03:48.152
<v Ricky Horton>I don't mind there by any means.
But like my teammates,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47383-3
08:03:48.152 --> 08:03:53.333
<v Ricky Horton>I got a picture of my teammates in there
when we go to Vegas every year and</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47383-4
08:03:53.333 --> 08:03:56.197
<v Ricky Horton>they're always like, yeah, your son is so.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47392-0
08:03:56.277 --> 08:04:02.277
<v Ricky Horton>So awesome. We my parents, but yeah,
I'll get it. They could be, you know,</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47392-1
08:04:02.277 --> 08:04:06.917
<v Ricky Horton>'cause they're,
I think I need to get some. That's funny.</v>

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47392-2
08:04:06.917 --> 08:04:11.957

cbbac12a-3fd8-4b47-ab8a-87383a37549e/47397-0
08:04:13.477 --> 08:04:17.637
<v Ricky Horton>A little bit about this field job.</v>
