<v Ricky Horton>John and Jack this morning.
They're asking how's we've been working.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/49-0
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.251
<v Ricky Horton>No,
that's all I'm saying from the person to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/49-1
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Ricky Horton>the chair, John. John's now Jerry Jerry,
Jerry is the way to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/50-0
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.332
<v Ricky Horton>I do.
You know how you mentioned you can use it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/50-1
00:07:32.332 --> 00:07:36.928
<v Ricky Horton>I'm actually writing them up. He said.
Oh yeah, he said.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/50-2
00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Ricky Horton>What we'll initiate it early is he posted
it to the job, but don't post it under.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/51-0
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.901
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, well,
we need a special code built in that we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/51-1
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:51.294
<v Ricky Horton>can use on each job. So we can say, OK,
standby time or whatever you want to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/51-2
00:07:51.294 --> 00:07:54.546
<v Ricky Horton>think about this.
And so I left again and we said, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/51-3
00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:58.083
<v Ricky Horton>we can do that. Yeah.
So that's what I'm writing in the front</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/51-4
00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Ricky Horton>now because I talked to Jim to clear,
Jimmy and Jerry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/52-0
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.004
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we need to just adjust the government</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/52-1
00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:10.179
<v Ricky Horton>funding to go together.
I got to Jimmy and that's what we should</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/52-2
00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:15.195
<v Ricky Horton>do. Yeah, you know,
to keep the people paid, but let's try to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/52-3
00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Ricky Horton>And that way it would affect all of our.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/53-0
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.009
<v Ricky Horton>Training, welding, layout,
and all the other stuff that we can still,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/53-1
00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, absolutely separate,
put it in and be creative.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/54-0
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Ricky Horton>That makes perfect change.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/55-0
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.266
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. Um, if there's any files,
I can give you some runtime if anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/55-1
00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, but if it's just those, let me know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/56-0
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/59-0
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:09.460
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, for every set of screeners, uh,
we we're at 4545 minutes to present.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/60-0
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, 20 foot sections.
And that's what we think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/60-1
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.820
<v Ricky Horton>And that's how she like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/61-0
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.140
<v Ricky Horton>Just if you get that sort of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/62-0
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:36.818
<v Ricky Horton>Or 20/30 section. OK, great.
So that's a good error in 20-3 Cortana</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/62-1
00:09:36.818 --> 00:09:39.980

<v Ricky Horton>Been doing it for quite a few years. So,
so, yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/71-2

<v Ricky Horton>we got some good context in the valley.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/72-0

<v Ricky Horton>Most kind of the stuff is already seen
before the Jerry's talking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/74-1
00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:12.020
<v Ricky Horton>I mostly they will have prices done there
and then that's what they're saying.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/75-0
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.647

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/75-1
00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:25.273
<v Ricky Horton>the time distribution or you don't build

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/80-1
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.140

00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:24.874
<v Ricky Horton>So there's there's talk about we're going
to have a procurement department and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/97-3
00:18:24.874 --> 00:18:29.980
<v Ricky Horton>it's just like, oh, you do procurement,
OK, I will speak to you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/98-0
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:36.380
<v Ricky Horton>Event site this this one established.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/99-0
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Ricky Horton>Do we have people will be buying stuff in
the negotiation,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/99-1
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.557
<v Ricky Horton>but they're not true purchasing people.
You know those bad stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/99-2
00:18:47.557 --> 00:18:52.611
<v Ricky Horton>What are you talking about, man?
I pulled out a true purchasing person in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/99-3
00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:53.020
<v Ricky Horton>there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/100-0
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.632
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I was wondering, you know,
there's the right amount of controls,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/100-1
00:18:58.632 --> 00:19:03.040
<v Ricky Horton>not too much, not too little. Yeah,
because otherwise you end up blocking the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/100-2
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.300
<v Ricky Horton>system up. What we were trying to do is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/101-0
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:14.140
<v Ricky Horton>Pool all of our purchasing for all the
different shops together so that we could.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/102-0
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.846
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, take advantage of, you know,
purchasing power. It is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/102-1
00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:22.687
<v Ricky Horton>They define power around the country.
Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/102-2
00:19:22.687 --> 00:19:27.466
<v Ricky Horton>we're we're trying to deal with our
consumables. We're working on a deal.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/102-3
00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:31.340
<v Ricky Horton>We're talking to air gas.
That's just something over there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/103-0
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, like, I don't know. I mean, we.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/104-0
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.975
<v Ricky Horton>They gave us the veterinarian system,
so we basically put the local building</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/104-1
00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:44.927
<v Ricky Horton>shops out of business because all we were
a huge buyer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/104-2
00:19:44.927 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Ricky Horton>It was Sunday with master agreements and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/105-0
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.260
<v Ricky Horton>Getting stuff like that,
things slowly going down.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/106-0
00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:01.576
<v Ricky Horton>The thing is that they're dealing with
local sales members and they didn't want</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/106-1
00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:02.300
<v Ricky Horton>it to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/107-0
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/108-0
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Ricky Horton>This town.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/109-0
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.860
<v Ricky Horton>Must be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/110-0
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:23.049
<v Ricky Horton>It is. Yeah, there it is. Yeah,
I woke it up at 4:00 from the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/110-1
00:20:23.049 --> 00:20:26.860
<v Ricky Horton>notification for PPL. Thanks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/111-0
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.452
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, yeah,
maybe the early Saturday or the late</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/111-1
00:20:31.452 --> 00:20:32.140
<v Ricky Horton>Saturday.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/113-0
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.650
<v Ricky Horton>All right.
I have a question about the we're making</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/113-1
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:43.973
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments like you guys were doing
yesterday, the parameters you asked me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/113-2
00:20:43.973 --> 00:20:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>Is there any part of log or saying, hey,
we're increasing the change recently?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/114-0
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.438
<v Ricky Horton>No, there's not any law, so we're sure.
Here's what it was. Here's what it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/114-1
00:20:56.438 --> 00:21:00.683
<v Ricky Horton>But then you can lock the estimates up so
they don't change.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/114-2
00:21:00.683 --> 00:21:05.555
<v Ricky Horton>There's not a law that tells me what what
changes. Can you dump them?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/114-3
00:21:05.555 --> 00:21:08.060
<v Ricky Horton>Can you dump the old settings? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/115-0
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:14.089
<v Ricky Horton>So without the old settings, yeah, yeah,
you can set up,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/115-1
00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:20.559
<v Ricky Horton>you can set up a different shop and it
will well some some things are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/115-2
00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:27.860
<v Ricky Horton>differentiate by shop like the hours and
stuff differentiate by shop we built.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/116-0
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:43.253
<v Ricky Horton>New shopping here,
but some structure that would that would</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/116-1
00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Ricky Horton>not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/117-0
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.260
<v Ricky Horton>Stay the same in one work. In other words,
they're the same across all shops.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/117-1
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.465
<v Ricky Horton>But yes,
you could export out all of the settings</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/117-2
00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:55.414
<v Ricky Horton>if you wanted to and then when you have
them,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/117-3
00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Ricky Horton>if you need bring them back in later,
what you do, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/118-0
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:06.036
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, luckily only Gavin can do it,
right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/118-1
00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:16.461
<v Ricky Horton>So he's he's the master of that domain.
You know, we start changing a lot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/118-2
00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:19.380
<v Ricky Horton>Absolutely. We start.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/119-0
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:34.100
<v Ricky Horton>Last week or something?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/120-0
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.355
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.
So with the lighting changes they made,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/120-1
00:22:40.355 --> 00:22:48.788
<v Ricky Horton>the only thing that was meeting some
adjustment or discussion where it finds</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/120-2
00:22:48.788 --> 00:22:50.540
<v Ricky Horton>something to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/121-0
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.998
<v Ricky Horton>I need to fit in the well the size of it.
Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/121-1
00:22:55.998 --> 00:23:04.069
<v Ricky Horton>because we are at least and even the the
size of the rates, we increase it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/121-2
00:23:04.069 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Ricky Horton>We're all in this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/122-0
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.328
<v Ricky Horton>Um, but well,
that should be that way anyways.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/122-1
00:23:10.328 --> 00:23:15.182
<v Ricky Horton>And then the changes are made to the
plate processing,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/122-2
00:23:15.182 --> 00:23:22.242
<v Ricky Horton>adjusting the speed and then also putting
the parameters full parameters in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/122-3
00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:25.860
<v Ricky Horton>plates. I was told that that should have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/123-0
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.151
<v Ricky Horton>Through main estimated one day when we
did it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/123-1
00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:34.478
<v Ricky Horton>So that side of things and that's some of
the changes to they think that they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/123-2
00:23:34.478 --> 00:23:39.871
<v Ricky Horton>using that how the buckets roll up 60 to
7% of the time we're using all that data</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/123-3
00:23:39.871 --> 00:23:44.540
<v Ricky Horton>is the same as it was before. OK,
it shouldn't have you in a different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/123-4
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.460
<v Ricky Horton>visual format.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/124-0
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.725
<v Ricky Horton>All right,
so and and if I can even table that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/124-1
00:23:48.725 --> 00:23:53.759
<v Ricky Horton>I think they should give it 100.
They know that also these guys use their</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/124-2
00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:57.023
<v Ricky Horton>efforts. It's not up here, right?
It's not too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/124-3
00:23:57.023 --> 00:24:00.220
<v Ricky Horton>And then as Ricky is saying what you have,
so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/125-0
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:08.020
<v Ricky Horton>And we really needed to get back so we
can all the time. You know, you can only.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/126-0
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.500
<v Ricky Horton>It would be nice.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/127-0
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:14.700
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/128-0
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.627
<v Ricky Horton>My guess is the electrical portion of it
again is going to be in the afternoon</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/128-1
00:24:26.627 --> 00:24:31.615
<v Ricky Horton>since Julie's not here this morning,
probably in some stuff to take care of it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/128-2
00:24:31.615 --> 00:24:35.045
<v Ricky Horton>But looking at our agenda,
we have meeting development</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/128-3
00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:35.980
<v Ricky Horton>implementation.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/129-0
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/130-0
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:48.826
<v Ricky Horton>It isn't for this one of the outside of
the outside of the of this area.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/130-1
00:24:48.826 --> 00:24:58.974
<v Ricky Horton>However with Part B in that section with
coatings shipping receiving fully adopted</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/130-2
00:24:58.974 --> 00:24:59.340
<v Ricky Horton>go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/131-0
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:07.273
<v Ricky Horton>So we we could call in Paul Perez or
Angelo get them here and then also I'm</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/131-1
00:25:07.273 --> 00:25:14.879
<v Ricky Horton>gonna record this so I don't think you
can so I can watch this back after</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/131-2
00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:17.860
<v Ricky Horton>because technically he's the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/132-0
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.798
<v Ricky Horton>Codings coordinator as well.
So I'm guessing he'll be facilitating</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/132-1
00:25:21.798 --> 00:25:26.559
<v Ricky Horton>some of the coding stuff that bringing
Chris Pena in here so that we can kind of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/132-2
00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:31.379
<v Ricky Horton>go over the process of go what these guys
are going to be seeing when they're out</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/132-3
00:25:31.379 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Ricky Horton>there with the shippers and then the
codings aspect to kind of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/133-0
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.375
<v Ricky Horton>At least cover this task.
I think that's really all we can do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/133-1
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:44.106
<v Ricky Horton>because those set up and it's a fully
functioning system at this point.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/133-2
00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:49.429
<v Ricky Horton>The implementation side of it's just us
getting equipment in the guy's hands and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/133-3
00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Ricky Horton>saying this is the law, follow it or.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/134-0
00:25:52.180 --> 00:26:01.063
<v Ricky Horton>The questions, you know what is go?
What software's go? That's part of it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/134-1
00:26:01.063 --> 00:26:07.340
<v Ricky Horton>So it's just the right version of it.
So you can do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/135-0
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:13.845
<v Ricky Horton>So it's just a module PowerPoint. Yeah,
I'm looking at it like a template version.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/135-1
00:26:13.845 --> 00:26:17.145
<v Ricky Horton>I'm looking at it like the input. Yeah,
no,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/135-2
00:26:17.145 --> 00:26:20.220
<v Ricky Horton>that's where you're getting this further.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/136-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/139-0
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:20.107
<v Ricky Horton>We have to go through each tablet.
I got 17 tablets or something to go there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/139-1
00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:25.280
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I mean it should be.
I've got a big charging station off the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/139-2
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.940

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/140-0
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.919
<v Ricky Horton>But I'll I'll share that.
I don't know if you have the volume.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/140-1
00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:39.775
<v Ricky Horton>It's not fast to account, but you know,
Martin's regular, I open weeks, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/140-2
00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:44.060
<v Ricky Horton>where he looks like they're having some
issues back to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/141-0
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.100
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's good to copy right there.
You definitely have two phones before us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/142-0
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Ricky Horton>I I usually don't go much more to 100,
but yeah, I try to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/142-1
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:04.604
<v Ricky Horton>Usually it's about a month,
month and a half. So last time,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/142-2
00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Ricky Horton>three days, I'm sorry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/143-0
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.264
<v Ricky Horton>It's a 24 up there. Oh,
that's good snacks. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/143-1
00:28:11.264 --> 00:28:17.526
<v Ricky Horton>And then you go and you open one guy's
door and he's got like a freaking grain</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/143-2
00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:22.679
<v Ricky Horton>of friction snacks in there.
So I think we're doing pretty good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/143-3
00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, the shop doesn't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/144-0
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.660
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/145-0
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.803
<v Ricky Horton>That's my stuff.
You're going to get my ability to order</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/145-1
00:28:31.803 --> 00:28:34.420
<v Ricky Horton>this stuff taken away from you, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/146-0
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:42.785
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's so of these guys in here.
I'm gonna take a quick look at my</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/146-1
00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Ricky Horton>invoices.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/147-0
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.020
<v Ricky Horton>Because I've got a weather.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/150-0
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.220
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, nice.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/151-0
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.018
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks so much.
I can't expect this next week,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/151-1
00:29:07.018 --> 00:29:09.500
<v Ricky Horton>always going to be down to, but we were.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/152-0
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:23.572
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to pull that vacuum and
replaced two type top teeth. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/152-1
00:29:23.572 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Ricky Horton>and then we got to continue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/153-0
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.886
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.
I guess we probably have to get it next</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/153-1
00:29:34.886 --> 00:29:39.970
<v Ricky Horton>week. Um,
we have to run the work that I will do,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/153-2
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:45.868
<v Ricky Horton>which week this week.
So I think that was starting today.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/153-3
00:29:45.868 --> 00:29:49.020
<v Ricky Horton>So I must say that's the issue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/154-0
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.277
<v Ricky Horton>Speed live. Do we have light bulbs coming?
Oh, no,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/154-1
00:29:53.277 --> 00:29:58.747
<v Ricky Horton>not the ones that you're familiar with.
The local workshop for the expansion.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/154-2
00:29:58.747 --> 00:30:01.763
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we're going to give Kate a credit of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/154-3
00:30:01.763 --> 00:30:05.900
<v Ricky Horton>coupons they gave us for a field job
through a light bulb.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-0
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.982
<v Ricky Horton>It was such a pain in the *** to get,
you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-1
00:30:08.982 --> 00:30:11.801
<v Ricky Horton>they just gave it to us for free and I
was like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-2
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:15.195
<v Ricky Horton>what's the issue with credit sometime in
the future? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-3
00:30:15.195 --> 00:30:19.164
<v Ricky Horton>we we had some things that we were
painting for them. So we kind of,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-4
00:30:19.164 --> 00:30:23.479
<v Ricky Horton>I went through, we took pictures,
we're seeing all the caveats to it and I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/155-5
00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Ricky Horton>hope it's something that we can look at.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/156-0
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Ricky Horton>This coming year. Oh,
I think Jeff's gonna take.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/157-0
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.620
<v Ricky Horton>That'd be. That'd be awesome.
I think it's probably fits this a lot</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/157-1
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.866
<v Ricky Horton>better.
Anyone wants to get out of everything</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/157-2
00:30:37.866 --> 00:30:42.171
<v Ricky Horton>that's not the pressure. Oh, really? OK,
they're not trying.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/157-3
00:30:42.171 --> 00:30:44.500
<v Ricky Horton>They're doing it without feeling.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/158-0
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Ricky Horton>They're just ******* all their customers
off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/159-0
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.620
<v Ricky Horton>That's why most of us here later.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/161-0
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Ricky Horton>There's lessons, you know,
satisfy your customers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/166-0
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.277
<v Ricky Horton>I forgot it. Yeah,
it went through the whole structure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/166-1
00:31:36.277 --> 00:31:38.580
<v Ricky Horton>It's Andy's gonna show you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/167-0
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:52.812
<v Ricky Horton>We should have found a fast way to search
it. What is it like to search it?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/167-1
00:31:52.812 --> 00:32:01.020
<v Ricky Horton>I would leave it.
I have somebody to get the results.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/168-0
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:09.075
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's definitely.
I don't think it's on the it's actually</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/168-1
00:32:09.075 --> 00:32:10.340
<v Ricky Horton>Microsoft.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/169-0
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.260
<v Ricky Horton>You know the number,
but it seems like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/170-0
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.020
<v Ricky Horton>It's fine, but fast.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/171-0
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:35.791
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you for joining us. Chris, Chris,
I know we've run into each other a couple</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/171-1
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:38.820
<v Ricky Horton>of times. What's that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/172-0
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:47.460
<v Ricky Horton>And then it's gonna be in the PDF,
so you can do one for the columns.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/177-0
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:14.559
<v Ricky Horton>But then it's still loading.
I don't want to keep down on my computer</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/177-1
00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Ricky Horton>if you want to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/180-0
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.425
<v Ricky Horton>Third,
I was pulling up a couple of our reports</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/180-1
00:33:26.425 --> 00:33:32.033
<v Ricky Horton>from with that statement show kind of
some of the reports that we pull where we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/180-2
00:33:32.033 --> 00:33:37.079
<v Ricky Horton>should be projects. What's this?
I hear you guys using the term like or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/180-3
00:33:37.079 --> 00:33:37.780
<v Ricky Horton>something?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/181-0
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.149
<v Ricky Horton>HoloLens. Yes,
and this is our this is our HoloLens.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/181-1
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:48.226
<v Ricky Horton>So essentially we load up an IT model in
the new fast station and then we overlay</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/181-2
00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:52.822
<v Ricky Horton>the model over our built assemblies to
see if anything's off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/181-3
00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:55.860
<v Ricky Horton>We've got our lines where it needs to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/182-0
00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.461
<v Ricky Horton>And and is that a visual check or does
like a program like Navisworks do a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/182-1
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:05.292
<v Ricky Horton>comparison?
This is the visual check and when you use</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/182-2
00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:08.484
<v Ricky Horton>the HoloLens,
it's within a 60th of an inch,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/182-3
00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Ricky Horton>but you have to pick it up or it picks it
up and warns you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/183-0
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.105
<v Ricky Horton>It picks it up so so identification
markers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/183-1
00:34:16.105 --> 00:34:21.513
<v Ricky Horton>We put these magnets that will pull it as
a reference point and then we pull the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/183-2
00:34:21.513 --> 00:34:25.519
<v Ricky Horton>correct model correspondence for this and
we'll overlay it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/183-3
00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:30.727
<v Ricky Horton>make sure it's still and then it takes
about 5 minutes to do a very intricate</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/183-4
00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.060
<v Ricky Horton>beam.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/184-0
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.916
<v Ricky Horton>And this is just one of our quality
checks that we are now encompassing over</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/184-1
00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:40.255
<v Ricky Horton>the last really heavy last year and a
half. Do you have the layout? Yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/184-2
00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:42.929
<v Ricky Horton>you can. Yes.
So do you need layout with it?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/184-3
00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:45.900
<v Ricky Horton>We have not gotten that far yet.
We do have some.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/185-0
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.986
<v Ricky Horton>Restriction, I would say,
with us being open shop because sometimes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/185-1
00:34:51.986 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Ricky Horton>one of these the sun is in your way,
you know, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/186-0
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:02.816
<v Ricky Horton>We we use this before we call our our QC
guy just to do a our QA you know on our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/186-1
00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:06.623
<v Ricky Horton>side for our leads.
That's part of our our process in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/186-2
00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:09.708
<v Ricky Horton>show.
I've seen some people using it in videos</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/186-3
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:11.020
<v Ricky Horton>as layout tool, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/187-0
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:19.560
<v Ricky Horton>But the holidays was discontinued. Yeah,
Microsoft discontinued. Um, they're 26,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/187-1
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:26.494
<v Ricky Horton>but they no longer manufacture those,
but they are trying to incorporate either</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/187-2
00:35:26.494 --> 00:35:28.140
<v Ricky Horton>Meta or another uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/188-0
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.957
<v Ricky Horton>Provider. Yeah, like,
I know Apple's gonna be coming out with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/188-1
00:35:31.957 --> 00:35:36.021
<v Ricky Horton>their own version. Yeah,
so we're working with that station on in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/188-2
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:39.037
<v Ricky Horton>that regard.
So do I think this is the last one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/188-3
00:35:39.037 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Ricky Horton>but I think there's some third party
people that do this as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/189-0
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Ricky Horton>Is it common to use it? Yes.
Oh no people that do like optical layout.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/190-0
00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.630
<v Ricky Horton>I am not not for layout.
That's that's not common.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/190-1
00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:03.462
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that I've ever seen it for
layout versus just you see personally,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/190-2
00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:07.872
<v Ricky Horton>but I'll see it again.
Eventually it will come on,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/190-3
00:36:07.872 --> 00:36:09.860
<v Ricky Horton>so I see something. OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/191-0
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.522
<v Ricky Horton>I think,
I think it was there to have that $2500</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/191-1
00:36:14.522 --> 00:36:21.078
<v Ricky Horton>license to get involved or pull the
trigger on whatever. So yeah, I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/191-2
00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:27.634
<v Ricky Horton>I think the HoloLens was almost toward
him. Yeah, it's pretty wild. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/191-3
00:36:27.634 --> 00:36:29.140
<v Ricky Horton>that one was the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/192-0
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.460
<v Ricky Horton>Very,
very trusting of us to put that hourly</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/192-1
00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.740
<v Ricky Horton>employee in the shop, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/193-0
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:42.580
<v Ricky Horton>The process has done pretty good and
we've we've gotten to the point where.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/194-0
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.592
<v Ricky Horton>We're getting the IFCS we need from all
our internal, internal detailers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/194-1
00:36:49.592 --> 00:36:54.890
<v Ricky Horton>So we want to send them inside the file
here so so that we can find that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/194-2
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Ricky Horton>definitely is nice to have when the
customer requests it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/195-0
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:00.500
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/196-0
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:07.300
<v Ricky Horton>I will get this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/197-0
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.100
<v Ricky Horton>I I thought so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/198-0
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:18.142
<v Ricky Horton>And the cell honesty chart.
This is what EPM Go looks like when you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/198-1
00:37:18.142 --> 00:37:22.953
<v Ricky Horton>pull it up in your tablet.
Also be your sign in screen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/198-2
00:37:22.953 --> 00:37:27.420
<v Ricky Horton>You'll end up coming in here.
Sign in with your ID.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/199-0
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna ask you to do a pass key and
so let me skip this one more time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/200-0
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:45.912
<v Ricky Horton>So this is what the mainstream is going
to look like with us using a format that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/200-1
00:37:45.912 --> 00:37:51.528
<v Ricky Horton>we're using at this point.
Most of everything you need will be in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/200-2
00:37:51.528 --> 00:37:53.740
<v Ricky Horton>the word packages portion.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/201-0
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.455
<v Ricky Horton>We just need to make sure codings is on
the same page with their codings only</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/201-1
00:37:59.455 --> 00:38:04.543
<v Ricky Horton>projects of creating the work package for
what they have going to the floor.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/201-2
00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:10.027
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see any reason why they wouldn't
use the exact same process flow that that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/201-3
00:38:10.027 --> 00:38:10.820
<v Ricky Horton>we're doing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/202-0
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.827
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
I also got the experiment here at the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/202-1
00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:18.020
<v Ricky Horton>time you'll see to get.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/207-0
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Ricky Horton>Spill.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/208-0
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.748
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
so you can go into the work packages,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/208-1
00:39:02.748 --> 00:39:09.236
<v Ricky Horton>just so you can see what this looks like.
So as it sits right now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/208-2
00:39:09.236 --> 00:39:12.140
<v Ricky Horton>you'll have your work package.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/209-0
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.392
<v Ricky Horton>Per project,
per area of work and then also sometimes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/209-1
00:39:17.392 --> 00:39:21.843
<v Ricky Horton>you'll see per project, per area of work,
per facility.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/209-2
00:39:21.843 --> 00:39:28.361
<v Ricky Horton>This is where we can really get down to
the nitty gritty of this is what needs to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/209-3
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:31.460
<v Ricky Horton>be come from first, this is the middle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/210-0
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.918
<v Ricky Horton>This is the follow and we can schedule
those kind of things out and assign</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/210-1
00:39:36.918 --> 00:39:42.106
<v Ricky Horton>priority based upon what should be
addressed first. With that being said,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/210-2
00:39:42.106 --> 00:39:47.575
<v Ricky Horton>when you go into this work package,
you can access all of the assemblies that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/210-3
00:39:47.575 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Ricky Horton>are associated in there.
You can get your drawings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/211-0
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.662
<v Ricky Horton>This information isn't going to be
practical for you guys,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/211-1
00:39:55.662 --> 00:40:01.126
<v Ricky Horton>but this piece tracking is what's going
to be relevant for you guys because</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/211-2
00:40:01.126 --> 00:40:06.590
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to be using the piece
tracking system in this to mark off your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/211-3
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Ricky Horton>guys stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/212-0
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.890
<v Ricky Horton>We didn't set up any inspections that are
tied to the project,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/212-1
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:17.430
<v Ricky Horton>so you would need to be able to see the
inspection that the current can't set up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/212-2
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:22.697
<v Ricky Horton>enough for service truck in that module.
You'd have to go back onto the home</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/212-3
00:40:22.697 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Ricky Horton>screen and go to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/213-0
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:30.612
<v Ricky Horton>Company line inspections and then do a
surface front inspection from that module</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/213-1
00:40:30.612 --> 00:40:34.636
<v Ricky Horton>in the future.
I'm guessing potentially we will be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/213-2
00:40:34.636 --> 00:40:38.424
<v Ricky Horton>adding coatings inspections on a project
basis.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/213-3
00:40:38.424 --> 00:40:41.580
<v Ricky Horton>So in that instance you would then need.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/214-0
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.358
<v Ricky Horton>Be able to access them from this specific
check box production status.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/214-1
00:40:46.358 --> 00:40:51.362
<v Ricky Horton>This is where if you guys have an
appointees only project, if it's simple,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/214-2
00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to have prep and prime.
If it's complex, it's going to have prep,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/214-3
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:56.900
<v Ricky Horton>prime.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/216-0
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.702
<v Ricky Horton>Intermediate code,
finished code and then we can expand on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/216-1
00:41:01.702 --> 00:41:07.185
<v Ricky Horton>that further as you guys do get on a more
complex system of tracking the the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/216-2
00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:10.460
<v Ricky Horton>inbetweens.
I I I don't know what the extent.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/216-3
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:14.448
<v Ricky Horton>I mean not not too pretty for the coding
set of things.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/216-4
00:41:14.448 --> 00:41:16.940
<v Ricky Horton>I mean you have a five code system.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/217-0
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:23.759
<v Ricky Horton>I can go in here and quickly create a
route that additional stations and adjust</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/217-1
00:41:23.759 --> 00:41:30.211
<v Ricky Horton>and get you guys the ability to piece
track each section of what you're going</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/217-2
00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:31.700
<v Ricky Horton>for and then also.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/218-0
00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:37.157
<v Ricky Horton>The ability to create load lists and in
the shipping side of lists.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/218-1
00:41:37.157 --> 00:41:43.012
<v Ricky Horton>So work packages are going to be super
helpful for keeping one guy in one place</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/218-2
00:41:43.012 --> 00:41:48.867
<v Ricky Horton>with all the data where it needs to be
having full visibility, your job number,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/218-3
00:41:48.867 --> 00:41:51.940
<v Ricky Horton>your area, work start date, due dates and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/219-0
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.540
<v Ricky Horton>Where it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/220-0
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.493
<v Ricky Horton>So this project doesn't have the piece
tracking associated with it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/220-1
00:41:58.493 --> 00:42:03.966
<v Ricky Horton>but I will go in here just to kind of
show you what this looks like for this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/220-2
00:42:03.966 --> 00:42:07.377
<v Ricky Horton>project.
This one's going to be catered to fab.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/220-3
00:42:07.377 --> 00:42:09.580
<v Ricky Horton>Actually this one doesn't have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/221-0
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:15.130
<v Ricky Horton>Some options on so I forgot I adjusted
some of our way to the fabrication routes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/221-1
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.357
<v Ricky Horton>that have that in there.
So this is going to be the screen that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/221-2
00:42:19.357 --> 00:42:24.772
<v Ricky Horton>one of your painters is going to have up
and or one of your prep guys is going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/221-3
00:42:24.772 --> 00:42:25.300
<v Ricky Horton>have up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/222-0
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.979
<v Ricky Horton>And when he grabs a batch of work, 15,
seven days that he's taken over into the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/222-1
00:42:30.979 --> 00:42:34.582
<v Ricky Horton>blast area,
he'll have this screen up on his tablet,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/222-2
00:42:34.582 --> 00:42:38.254
<v Ricky Horton>he'll go into this ad bats portion,
he'll go in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/222-3
00:42:38.254 --> 00:42:43.692
<v Ricky Horton>And when he's got everything ready to go,
he's going to get coming here and hit</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/222-4
00:42:43.692 --> 00:42:44.100
<v Ricky Horton>start.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/223-0
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:51.215
<v Ricky Horton>Then he can go start blasting all of this
stuff and once he has all of those</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/223-1
00:42:51.215 --> 00:42:58.980
<v Ricky Horton>assemblies done, then he can come in here,
hit stop and then go to update and first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/224-0
00:42:59.380 --> 00:42:59.980
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/225-0
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.580
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/226-0
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.253
<v Ricky Horton>That's would be if all of those pieces
are there, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/226-1
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:12.392
<v Ricky Horton>So hit the start at the beginning of it,
update Max quantity.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/226-2
00:43:12.392 --> 00:43:17.533
<v Ricky Horton>Now if we wanted to be really regular,
just to ensure that you guys have the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/226-3
00:43:17.533 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Ricky Horton>total count of what you're going for
instead of doing the Max quantity.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/227-0
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:29.424
<v Ricky Horton>And you go in there and go line by line.
OK, I've got two of these, four of these,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/227-1
00:43:29.424 --> 00:43:33.151
<v Ricky Horton>four of these, four of these,
and one of these.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/227-2
00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:38.740
<v Ricky Horton>And then from there you would click
update and then this would get you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/228-0
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.540
<v Ricky Horton>If we go to production status at two
points and see in the area.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/229-0
00:43:49.420 --> 00:44:01.900
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the 2nd button over on the on the
variety.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/230-0
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/231-0
00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:05.580
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/232-0
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Ricky Horton>So now we will see all of those items
that we just completed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/232-1
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:17.211
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine enough in the prep portion.
So from that then it would go into its</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/232-2
00:44:17.211 --> 00:44:21.027
<v Ricky Horton>next area.
So you could go back in your production</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/232-3
00:44:21.027 --> 00:44:21.700
<v Ricky Horton>tracking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/233-0
00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:24.580
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/234-0
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.606
<v Ricky Horton>Just did it right.
They were it says production tracking,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/234-1
00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:35.915
<v Ricky Horton>so and then you're going to prime,
going to add batch and you would follow</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/234-2
00:44:35.915 --> 00:44:40.728
<v Ricky Horton>that same process, hit start.
The biggest thing that we're going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/234-3
00:44:40.728 --> 00:44:41.860
<v Ricky Horton>want to confirm.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/235-0
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Ricky Horton>Is when we want that start button to be
hit.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/235-1
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:52.067
<v Ricky Horton>Is it when an operator comes over with a
stack of everything that's full out of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/235-2
00:44:52.067 --> 00:44:57.934
<v Ricky Horton>glass and it's still on a pallet before
you guys put it up on some horses or if</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/235-3
00:44:57.934 --> 00:44:58.300
<v Ricky Horton>it's?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/236-0
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.943
<v Ricky Horton>Once it's on the soft horse and staged
out, everything's ready to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/236-1
00:45:03.943 --> 00:45:07.326
<v Ricky Horton>Paint gun is ready to go,
primer is ready to rock.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/236-2
00:45:07.326 --> 00:45:11.903
<v Ricky Horton>Then you hit start and then start
painting and then once you're done</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/236-3
00:45:11.903 --> 00:45:16.280
<v Ricky Horton>painting, then hit stop.
So that's one discussion that we'll have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/236-4
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.540
<v Ricky Horton>to have with Mo on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/237-0
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:23.205
<v Ricky Horton>And if he's trying to capture the full
scale of his process in each of these</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/237-1
00:45:23.205 --> 00:45:26.956
<v Ricky Horton>categories,
or if he's trying to capture the nitty</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/237-2
00:45:26.956 --> 00:45:32.620
<v Ricky Horton>gritty of this is what it takes to blast
handling is going to be in between.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/238-0
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:39.188
<v Ricky Horton>And then this is what it's going to take
the pain. Everything else is in between.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/238-1
00:45:39.188 --> 00:45:44.868
<v Ricky Horton>So, so I guess a question for you.
I know I've seen a lot of different when</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/238-2
00:45:44.868 --> 00:45:48.380
<v Ricky Horton>they're setting up their machine for this
job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/239-0
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.661
<v Ricky Horton>Are there any go?
So that's one thing we want to make sure</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/239-1
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:55.556
<v Ricky Horton>with Moe,
if that's something that he wants</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/239-2
00:45:55.556 --> 00:45:59.897
<v Ricky Horton>included in this portion,
because I think that would be relevant,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/239-3
00:45:59.897 --> 00:46:04.568
<v Ricky Horton>especially in the in the time. Yeah,
they're popular mixing their pay,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/239-4
00:46:04.568 --> 00:46:05.620
<v Ricky Horton>you know, again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/240-0
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.852
<v Ricky Horton>And then the second part would be would,
you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/240-1
00:46:09.852 --> 00:46:14.091
<v Ricky Horton>because our our spray man has a botman
who's mixing his paint,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/240-2
00:46:14.091 --> 00:46:17.523
<v Ricky Horton>who's folding his line,
who's checking it for him.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/240-3
00:46:17.523 --> 00:46:22.300
<v Ricky Horton>So they both like they both would have a
different tablet they can go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/241-0
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.823
<v Ricky Horton>So, so it'll be one guy.
The way that our estimates currently set</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/241-1
00:46:27.823 --> 00:46:34.051
<v Ricky Horton>up that our factor is factored with two
guys assisting in every portion of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/241-2
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:38.860
<v Ricky Horton>work that you guys are talking about.
So with this tracking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/242-0
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:43.446
<v Ricky Horton>The assumption is going to be that there
is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/242-1
00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:50.049
<v Ricky Horton>so you will be able to do that the in the
next version, like I said,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/242-2
00:46:50.049 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>in 2026 you got both guys,
that's all going to breakdown and keep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/243-0
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.540
<v Ricky Horton>Now I mean theoretically,
does there one guy could be?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/244-0
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.634
<v Ricky Horton>He could process to agree the piece and
then another guy process to agree the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/244-1
00:47:06.634 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Ricky Horton>piece and now you capture both their
times. Yep. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/245-0
00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:16.909
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, when we process it for that.
So but this is the higher level over the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/245-1
00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:22.960
<v Ricky Horton>entirety of what's included in the work
package or the sequence on the block.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/245-2
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.700
<v Ricky Horton>You can do individual tracking online
items and track your hours as such.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/246-0
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:35.909
<v Ricky Horton>Per piece and so you can switch to
part-timers and each one will have its</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/246-1
00:47:35.909 --> 00:47:43.043
<v Ricky Horton>own if you have a very complex assembly
and a lot of those relatively similar</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/246-2
00:47:43.043 --> 00:47:44.780
<v Ricky Horton>complex assemblies.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/247-0
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.438
<v Ricky Horton>You can time studies on individual items
like W&amp;</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/247-1
00:47:48.438 --> 00:47:53.663
<v Ricky Horton>W with those big columns and say, well,
at the start of the project we were doing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/247-2
00:47:53.663 --> 00:47:57.869
<v Ricky Horton>one column in 30 minutes.
By the end of the project we were doing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/247-3
00:47:57.869 --> 00:47:59.780
<v Ricky Horton>one column in one and kind of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/248-0
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.477
<v Ricky Horton>Get an average.
So next time you guys bid it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/248-1
00:48:02.477 --> 00:48:06.612
<v Ricky Horton>you can shoot it right in the middle and
have have the middle ground be able to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/248-2
00:48:06.612 --> 00:48:08.420
<v Ricky Horton>take the numbers and everything so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/249-0
00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:17.657
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's one of the main things.
So work packaging is super helpful having</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/249-1
00:48:17.657 --> 00:48:24.500
<v Ricky Horton>the the transparency or transparency of
can I forget to share the screen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/250-0
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:33.204
<v Ricky Horton>And the transparency of everything in
place. Now assuming this function,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/250-1
00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:39.420
<v Ricky Horton>the work package isn't set up and you
guys are trying to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/251-0
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.844
<v Ricky Horton>You're you're at this screen.
You don't have the work packages set up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/251-1
00:48:45.844 --> 00:48:51.666
<v Ricky Horton>You got the project number in sequence.
You can go into the projects portion and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/251-2
00:48:51.666 --> 00:48:54.900
<v Ricky Horton>then filter for your project.
We'll do 6145.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/252-0
00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:03.759
<v Ricky Horton>Then you can open the project and you'll
see that a lot of this information is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/252-1
00:49:03.759 --> 00:49:11.119
<v Ricky Horton>very similar to what's in the in the work
package, but this is on project scale,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/252-2
00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:13.300
<v Ricky Horton>so with this being said.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/253-0
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.608
<v Ricky Horton>If it's a really big project,
then you're going to have to go into your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/253-1
00:49:18.608 --> 00:49:22.621
<v Ricky Horton>filters up in the top here,
build it for the sequencing log that you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/253-2
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:25.587
<v Ricky Horton>guys have on the floor that you're trying
to code,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/253-3
00:49:25.587 --> 00:49:28.902
<v Ricky Horton>and then you can go through the same
exact process here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/253-4
00:49:28.902 --> 00:49:33.380
<v Ricky Horton>That's just why we're packaging so little
easier for the guys less thinking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/254-0
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:40.974
<v Ricky Horton>We did the filtering in the front end so
that you guys have transparency of what's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/254-1
00:49:40.974 --> 00:49:45.500
<v Ricky Horton>gonna come out to you in batches in any
case, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/255-0
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.620
<v Ricky Horton>Hear me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/256-0
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Ricky Horton>It's fine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/257-0
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.851
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So,
so that's the biggest thing is with this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/257-1
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:03.951
<v Ricky Horton>we've got a bunch of devices that we're
going to be assigned to your guys and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/257-2
00:50:03.951 --> 00:50:10.443
<v Ricky Horton>this is what we have set up in the system
that law wants to use going forward that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/257-3
00:50:10.443 --> 00:50:13.180
<v Ricky Horton>everyone on this property is going.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/258-0
00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:19.315
<v Ricky Horton>To be using for tracking purposes.
So anything that touches the fabrication</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/258-1
00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:23.526
<v Ricky Horton>shop in coatings,
me and Helen will be set up in the way</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/258-2
00:50:23.526 --> 00:50:27.884
<v Ricky Horton>that you guys are going to see it based
upon coating spec,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/258-3
00:50:27.884 --> 00:50:30.100
<v Ricky Horton>anything that's coatings only.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/259-0
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:36.677
<v Ricky Horton>That will be essentially managed by Emily
and depending you maybe mode,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/259-1
00:50:36.677 --> 00:50:43.453
<v Ricky Horton>but something that you guys will have
this available to you so that we can get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/259-2
00:50:43.453 --> 00:50:45.340
<v Ricky Horton>percentage completion.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/260-0
00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.627
<v Ricky Horton>Where you basically have to be the
process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/260-1
00:50:48.627 --> 00:50:54.234
<v Ricky Horton>So then if if something's in there,
we've got multiple jobs in there and if</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/260-2
00:50:54.234 --> 00:51:00.210
<v Ricky Horton>every guy's entering these in within a
few minutes of them getting it completed,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/260-3
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:01.980
<v Ricky Horton>you can be at your best.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/262-0
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.483
<v Ricky Horton>You know, hey, I just got a phone call.
Yeah, it's like we're 50% complete.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/262-1
00:51:07.483 --> 00:51:10.782
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to prime and perhaps 100%
completed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/262-2
00:51:10.782 --> 00:51:16.074
<v Ricky Horton>Prime is 50% complete right now because
as soon as these guys mark this off,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/262-3
00:51:16.074 --> 00:51:17.860
<v Ricky Horton>it's instantly updated on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/263-0
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:23.037
<v Ricky Horton>Production in your computer version and
you can reference that immediately.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/263-1
00:51:23.037 --> 00:51:27.031
<v Ricky Horton>So that'll that'll save you from having a
pop on a golf cart,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/263-2
00:51:27.031 --> 00:51:30.897
<v Ricky Horton>run out there and physically check
exactly what's going on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/263-3
00:51:30.897 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Ricky Horton>It should give you a good high level view
of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/264-0
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.651
<v Ricky Horton>As long as you guys are holding your guys
to, once this is done,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/264-1
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:42.819
<v Ricky Horton>it's not a at the end of the day.
I'm gonna go get all these updated,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/264-2
00:51:42.819 --> 00:51:45.439
<v Ricky Horton>get it done.
You have a tablet right there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/264-3
00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:48.892
<v Ricky Horton>You're ready to go.
I can tell you the ones that say I'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/264-4
00:51:48.892 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Ricky Horton>just wait for the end of the day.
It's never right. It's never right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/265-0
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.700
<v Ricky Horton>So this is on the read live.
How's the how's the?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/266-0
00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:05.485
<v Ricky Horton>Otterbox. You swap it out.
As long as they never come around. Sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/266-1
00:52:05.485 --> 00:52:09.370
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
And that'll get you on there because it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/266-2
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:13.822
<v Ricky Horton>our first go around with it.
So it's still unforeseen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/266-3
00:52:13.822 --> 00:52:17.140
<v Ricky Horton>I know we've got everything's covered by.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/267-0
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:25.234
<v Ricky Horton>Whatever it's going to be covered nursery,
but as long as they have covered over the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/267-1
00:52:25.234 --> 00:52:31.429
<v Ricky Horton>screen and there's within a case,
it's going to be recycling these cases</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/267-2
00:52:31.429 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Ricky Horton>every six months or so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/268-0
00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:39.400
<v Ricky Horton>And it's a touch screen. It's an iPad,
you know, so they'll have,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/268-1
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:45.916
<v Ricky Horton>they'll have the capabilities and I'm
pretty sure the one who looked at it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/268-2
00:52:45.916 --> 00:52:48.660
<v Ricky Horton>that's not looked into. So yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/269-0
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:53.746
<v Ricky Horton>So you'll get it completely discovered at
some point and they'll they'll learn to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/269-1
00:52:53.746 --> 00:52:56.498
<v Ricky Horton>play. OK,
flip it over so the screen's not up or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/269-2
00:52:56.498 --> 00:52:59.306
<v Ricky Horton>whatever.
Maybe don't use the screen and have the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/269-3
00:52:59.306 --> 00:53:03.742
<v Ricky Horton>little keyboard thing so you can throw
keyboards away. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/269-4
00:53:03.742 --> 00:53:05.820
<v Ricky Horton>Mark can see and use the stylus here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/270-0
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:11.118
<v Ricky Horton>You have 18 hands, uses as.
So this is the main function of trying to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/270-1
00:53:11.118 --> 00:53:16.736
<v Ricky Horton>get you Privy to this because I'm sure
they're probably going to be having you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/270-2
00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Ricky Horton>push this to the guys if you have any
questions or anything along.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/271-0
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:29.300
<v Ricky Horton>The process of us pushing this out and
making this our set in stone goal.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/272-0
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:35.607
<v Ricky Horton>Always available, Al's always available.
This is a very user-friendly interface.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/272-1
00:53:35.607 --> 00:53:39.643
<v Ricky Horton>So once your guys are used to the this is
where I go from this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/272-2
00:53:39.643 --> 00:53:43.993
<v Ricky Horton>This is where I go from this.
There's really only two or three areas</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/272-3
00:53:43.993 --> 00:53:45.380
<v Ricky Horton>that are logging this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/273-0
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:50.264
<v Ricky Horton>And you can use what you use.
So what does it start?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/273-1
00:53:50.264 --> 00:53:55.528
<v Ricky Horton>We have all of the tablets,
so it's pretty much just gonna be either</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/273-2
00:53:55.528 --> 00:54:01.555
<v Ricky Horton>Monday next week or Friday next week.
We're gonna assign devices to people and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/273-3
00:54:01.555 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Ricky Horton>say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/274-0
00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:07.529
<v Ricky Horton>This is what you're gonna do.
Or you can run somewhere else to look.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/274-1
00:54:07.529 --> 00:54:11.500
<v Ricky Horton>I'm using for a GMLSVI or no.
Don't believe so, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/275-0
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:18.170
<v Ricky Horton>So that'll be you'll also be a a pushing
factor on this and if we need to do a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/275-1
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.921
<v Ricky Horton>separate meeting just with me and all of
you coding guys,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/275-2
00:54:21.921 --> 00:54:26.836
<v Ricky Horton>once we get devices and do the sand,
we can go over that and just do a once</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/275-3
00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Ricky Horton>over and make sure everyone's on the same
page.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/276-0
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.311
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
but pretty simple process and then kinda</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/276-1
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:38.180
<v Ricky Horton>tailing back into why these work packages
are super helpful. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/277-0
00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.668
<v Ricky Horton>Going into here,
especially with your side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/277-1
00:54:43.668 --> 00:54:48.539
<v Ricky Horton>I know they tend to have you QC things
sometimes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/277-2
00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:54.580
<v Ricky Horton>So from here you can access all of your
drawings if you need.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/278-0
00:54:54.660 --> 00:55:01.504
<v Ricky Horton>For anything you guys are working on,
can come in here and pull up the specific</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/278-1
00:55:01.504 --> 00:55:07.150
<v Ricky Horton>drawing file for which you need and
you'll have about everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/278-2
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:11.940
<v Ricky Horton>So if you guys do need to reference it,
you can really.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/279-0
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.315
<v Ricky Horton>It looks like it's up there. Yeah,
this is like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/279-1
00:55:20.315 --> 00:55:23.402
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have to double check around.
It would be right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/279-2
00:55:23.402 --> 00:55:27.770
<v Ricky Horton>See where it's at the latest. Yes,
there would be a PDF right under there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/279-3
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:30.100
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the drawing list and get back there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/280-0
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.460
<v Ricky Horton>You'll see right there to the very left,
it's blind,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/280-1
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:43.794
<v Ricky Horton>but next to the 101 on the floor there
would be low PDF right there that would</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/280-2
00:55:43.794 --> 00:55:48.992
<v Ricky Horton>not the girl.
Is that a physical link that somebody has</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/280-3
00:55:48.992 --> 00:55:51.220
<v Ricky Horton>to set or how does that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/281-0
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.904
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, essential.
So I'll make sure with all of our updates</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/281-1
00:55:55.904 --> 00:56:01.570
<v Ricky Horton>that all of our directors are set up for
this still and that everything's where</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/281-2
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:07.236
<v Ricky Horton>everything needs to be because he's this
one was clearly work and Magnus is the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/281-3
00:56:07.236 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Ricky Horton>drive student in the work on the initial.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/282-0
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:16.548
<v Ricky Horton>He probably didn't get a request to file
and it was a kiss file and they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/282-1
00:56:16.548 --> 00:56:20.966
<v Ricky Horton>probably working on it in.
I can see the there and then the rev</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/282-2
00:56:20.966 --> 00:56:24.971
<v Ricky Horton>zeros. So yeah,
it looks like some of them said your owns</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/282-3
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:27.180
<v Ricky Horton>are in years designed your owns.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/283-0
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:33.359
<v Ricky Horton>And and the same with the dogs. Yeah, so,
so I'll take a look at this on the end.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/283-1
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:38.898
<v Ricky Horton>This would be where you guys would
reference the drawings and you could pull</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/283-2
00:56:38.898 --> 00:56:42.710
<v Ricky Horton>all that up.
We don't have any inspection set up for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/283-3
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:44.580
<v Ricky Horton>for 20 stuff in here, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/284-0
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:50.876
<v Ricky Horton>For the inspection that we did set up for
Moe while he was in here is in this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/284-1
00:56:50.876 --> 00:56:56.180
<v Ricky Horton>general inspection staff.
In here you can go in and test that with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/284-2
00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Ricky Horton>paint for surface carp inspection and
this one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/285-0
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:05.764
<v Ricky Horton>We ended up doing one test one.
Essentially you're going here shop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/285-1

<v Ricky Horton>Pass or fail any specific notes.
If you end up clicking add file,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/286-1
00:57:22.513 --> 00:57:25.644
<v Ricky Horton>it'll generally prompt you to take a
picture.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/286-2
00:57:25.644 --> 00:57:29.932

00:57:29.932 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Ricky Horton>you could take a picture of the fail
attached to this inspection report.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/287-0
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.797

00:57:38.797 --> 00:57:43.373
<v Ricky Horton>be associated with the job number,
you can go into my inspection reports,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/287-2
00:57:43.373 --> 00:57:48.382
<v Ricky Horton>different job numbers and pull a report
that breaks down all the inspections for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/287-3
00:57:48.382 --> 00:57:51.536
<v Ricky Horton>projects,

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/287-4
00:57:51.536 --> 00:57:52.340
<v Ricky Horton>put together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/288-0
00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.100
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/289-0

will bring you back to your home screen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/289-2
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:08.064
<v Ricky Horton>But this is that was kind of the the main
function that I was trying to show you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/289-3
00:58:08.064 --> 00:58:12.639
<v Ricky Horton>this in the future potentially they might
have us add you guys in the phone</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/289-4
00:58:12.639 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Ricky Horton>tracking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/290-0
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.348
<v Ricky Horton>Um, I don't know how that's going to work.
I I don't think you guys are still using</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/290-1
00:58:19.348 --> 00:58:23.964
<v Ricky Horton>the temp workers and whatnot and you
could add into their time differently. Uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/290-2
00:58:23.964 --> 00:58:28.292
<v Ricky Horton>all of our shop has been invested.
So do you think the temp workers should</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/290-3
00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:29.100
<v Ricky Horton>still work or?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/291-0
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:34.835
<v Ricky Horton>That being the case more likely probably
won't have you guys there in time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/291-1
00:58:34.835 --> 00:58:39.283
<v Ricky Horton>tracking through here.
This is that doesn't that doesn't drive</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/291-2
00:58:39.283 --> 00:58:45.143
<v Ricky Horton>as easily down the road if we do venture
into that the time tracking module we can</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/291-3
00:58:45.143 --> 00:58:46.060
<v Ricky Horton>go over that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/292-0
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:52.864
<v Ricky Horton>So your main functions will be projects
and work packages and you can access any</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/292-1
00:58:52.864 --> 00:58:58.815
<v Ricky Horton>of all of what you need from there to be
able to do your piece tracking,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/292-2
00:58:58.815 --> 00:59:01.260
<v Ricky Horton>check production statuses and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/293-0
00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:08.997
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll,
I'll take a look and see and make sure</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/293-1
00:59:08.997 --> 00:59:17.170
<v Ricky Horton>you have a archive to go log in and sign
to be sure. But yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/293-2
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:21.580
<v Ricky Horton>you should be able to. Yeah, it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/294-0
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:27.211
<v Ricky Horton>So it's not the only thing I have access
to this tech. OK, so yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/294-1
00:59:27.211 --> 00:59:32.054
<v Ricky Horton>this this you can access right when you
go back to your desk.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/294-2
00:59:32.054 --> 00:59:38.380
<v Ricky Horton>You can also pull this up on your phone,
the meeting tablet as long as you have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/295-0
00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:45.765
<v Ricky Horton>This domain,
then you can access that any point.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/295-1
00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:56.768
<v Ricky Horton>So it would be really nice to find a way
to set a filter for work packages for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/295-2
00:59:56.768 --> 00:59:58.300
<v Ricky Horton>these guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/296-0
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.827
<v Ricky Horton>I would say sure we need a job to just
carry the stat way the organization of it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/296-1
01:00:03.827 --> 01:00:08.840
<v Ricky Horton>would be just to apply to them.
I mean the first thought is to the group,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/296-2
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.565
<v Ricky Horton>the group things,
but I'm not sure how you can use the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/296-3
01:00:12.565 --> 01:00:15.884
<v Ricky Horton>group,
the group builders if you want to see the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/296-4
01:00:15.884 --> 01:00:16.900
<v Ricky Horton>group builders.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/297-0
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.980
<v Ricky Horton>Right now, um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/298-0
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.009
<v Ricky Horton>The most prevalent group in there is
phone cranes because we get so many phone</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/298-1
01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:27.977
<v Ricky Horton>crane jobs. Yeah,
we group all our phone crane jobs</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/298-2
01:00:27.977 --> 01:00:31.288
<v Ricky Horton>together loosely.
We tend to get a lot of job numbers for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/298-3
01:00:31.288 --> 01:00:34.998
<v Ricky Horton>that specific customer.
So it's kind of a customer on a customer</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/298-4
01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:35.340
<v Ricky Horton>basis.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/299-0
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.938
<v Ricky Horton>So you're using both of these group,
those group deals, yeah, but yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/299-1
01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:44.631
<v Ricky Horton>we must,
because otherwise if they're looking for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/299-2
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:50.023
<v Ricky Horton>a problem and you didn't see all the fast
stuff that that may not apply.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/299-3
01:00:50.023 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Ricky Horton>So who's responsible for setting up to
make sure that codings just see?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/300-0
01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:01.506
<v Ricky Horton>See what coding needs to employee by
employee basis. It's just filtering.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/300-1
01:01:01.506 --> 01:01:08.331
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess what I'm saying is when I saw
earlier on and kind of like 101101 twice,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/300-2
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:14.580
<v Ricky Horton>make sure that it only shows up once and
it's just relevant to the codings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/301-0
01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.626
<v Ricky Horton>Work. So the PC,
the ones that control that's in this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/301-1
01:01:19.626 --> 01:01:24.529
<v Ricky Horton>drawing index,
and essentially with that being Rev A and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/301-2
01:01:24.529 --> 01:01:28.916
<v Ricky Horton>one with being Rev 0,
if there's a Rev A in there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/301-3
01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Ricky Horton>they cannot access that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/303-0
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.865
<v Ricky Horton>It'll show you know that there is a rev
in the system and it'll show drawing log</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/303-1
01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:40.047
<v Ricky Horton>wise,
but it will only let you access the most</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/303-2
01:01:40.047 --> 01:01:43.364
<v Ricky Horton>current.
The issue with that one I need to check</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/303-3
01:01:43.364 --> 01:01:46.140
<v Ricky Horton>and see if if our directories are linked.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/304-0
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:52.686
<v Ricky Horton>And make sure that because we have had
connection issues between our database</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/304-1
01:01:52.686 --> 01:01:57.746
<v Ricky Horton>and ETM both the plans.
I get to call the KC inspector all the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/304-2
01:01:57.746 --> 01:02:02.003
<v Ricky Horton>time. Hey,
what's going on and it's between exterior</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/304-3
01:02:02.003 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Ricky Horton>customer giving us just file doing a
different style.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/305-0
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.340
<v Ricky Horton>The important drawings not going to be a
law appropriately or.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/306-0
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Ricky Horton>The directory not being set up correctly,
so we need data that isn't actually got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/306-1
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:21.292
<v Ricky Horton>something to do with it.
Some of the drawings anywhere on any jobs,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/306-2
01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:25.195
<v Ricky Horton>every time you know they're going to see
if you see the drawings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/306-3
01:02:25.195 --> 01:02:27.856
<v Ricky Horton>We we set up the global default
directories.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/306-4
01:02:27.856 --> 01:02:31.700
<v Ricky Horton>There was a map there I was generally not
a thing on the server.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/307-0
01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:35.666
<v Ricky Horton>Server and so this goes off the on the
server.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/307-1
01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:39.635
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's looking for a R drive on the
server,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/307-2
01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:45.836
<v Ricky Horton>it's really like the C drive on the
server, then it's not going to see it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/307-3
01:02:45.836 --> 01:02:49.060
<v Ricky Horton>That might be something we have to fix.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/311-0
01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:04.561
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I wanted to work that.
I'll be on the, the, the,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/311-1
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:13.100
<v Ricky Horton>it might be something we have to. Yeah,
this project ran all the way through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/312-0
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.485
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
that's probably just one of the lines of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/312-1
01:03:17.485 --> 01:03:23.945
<v Ricky Horton>this Mac drive. Yeah, on the server,
probably it's not the Mac drive on the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/312-2
01:03:23.945 --> 01:03:28.620
<v Ricky Horton>server. Yeah, I need to use the,
I mean the full pack.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/313-0
01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:35.458
<v Ricky Horton>We can do it instead of our use the
computer name, slash, whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/313-1
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:40.660
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll make note of that so that I can
get that fixed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/314-0
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:47.745
<v Ricky Horton>And you've been signing that should be
receiving will use this as well, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/314-1
01:03:47.745 --> 01:03:52.612
<v Ricky Horton>And then somebody sets their packages up
separately, separately.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/314-2
01:03:52.612 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Ricky Horton>Their portion will have nothing to do
with packages.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/315-0
01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:03.034
<v Ricky Horton>Their portion will be packages because
they'll be shipping some items out,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/315-1
01:04:03.034 --> 01:04:08.519
<v Ricky Horton>but their portion will be material
receiving as well as generating roadless</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/315-2
01:04:08.519 --> 01:04:12.633
<v Ricky Horton>and trucking roads.
So you guys will have the tablet out</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/315-3
01:04:12.633 --> 01:04:17.180
<v Ricky Horton>there. If a load comes in,
you can pull up the purchase order.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/316-0
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Ricky Horton>See what items are on the quantities.
You can mark it perceived as it comes in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/316-1
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:27.437
<v Ricky Horton>and then all back to business can go in
and attach the PDS.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/316-2
01:04:27.437 --> 01:04:32.159
<v Ricky Horton>So you'll have your your bill of lading
and you'll say one HSS.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/316-3
01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:36.660
<v Ricky Horton>You'll manually type the key number in
there, click receive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/317-0
01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:47.346
<v Ricky Horton>And as long as Paul has been received,
he can then attach all of those PDFS to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/317-1
01:04:47.346 --> 01:04:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>associate all of the seat numbers so that
we can still do our tracks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/318-0
01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:03.741
<v Ricky Horton>So it'll all be preset. Yeah,
every purchase order that we issue gives</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/318-1
01:05:03.741 --> 01:05:12.111
<v Ricky Horton>them a list of of what they're needed and
they also get which there should be some</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/318-2
01:05:12.111 --> 01:05:13.220
<v Ricky Horton>orders now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/319-0
01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:22.063
<v Ricky Horton>Will our shop paint be tracked the same
way through here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/319-1
01:05:22.063 --> 01:05:28.068
<v Ricky Horton>I think they're working towards issuing
tech appeals for the paint,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/319-2
01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:32.660
<v Ricky Horton>but that unfortunately we haven't really
discussed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/320-0
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:39.769
<v Ricky Horton>We don't really have anything broke out
in the inventory or anything in the size</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/320-1
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:44.873
<v Ricky Horton>database for paint.
So that one's kind of a territory at this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/320-2
01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:48.660
<v Ricky Horton>point.
Talking about the track basically look</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/320-3
01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.940
<v Ricky Horton>where you have it,
you know how we get down to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/321-0
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.150
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
So we did our list of BO and duplicated</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/321-1
01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:02.177
<v Ricky Horton>it into SEVA and then we break down the
items in there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/321-2
01:06:02.177 --> 01:06:09.090
<v Ricky Horton>which is incredibly relevant for our
steel purchases because then it goes in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/321-3
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:12.860
<v Ricky Horton>our inventory, past remnants and incoming.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/322-0
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:18.647
<v Ricky Horton>However, with the paint portion,
there's no there's no paint specs that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/322-1
01:06:18.647 --> 01:06:24.777
<v Ricky Horton>broke out in there and it would almost
have to be put in there with live item.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/322-2
01:06:24.777 --> 01:06:31.140
<v Ricky Horton>If we don't always be getting 5 gallon
pails of this paint spec, then you can go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/323-0
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.780
<v Ricky Horton>5 gallon bill,
5 solids and then Frank to see Sherman</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/323-1
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.299
<v Ricky Horton>Williams and then you could go into a
purchase order,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/323-2
01:06:40.299 --> 01:06:47.078
<v Ricky Horton>align that bio item in there and quantify
that and say we're using 5 five gallon</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/323-3
01:06:47.078 --> 01:06:47.580
<v Ricky Horton>pills.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/324-0
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:50.767
<v Ricky Horton>Then we could do that.
But if you guys are,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/324-1
01:06:50.767 --> 01:06:54.985
<v Ricky Horton>you would be limited to the point of we
use 11 gallon of this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/324-2
01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:59.070
<v Ricky Horton>five gallon of that,
and we have 4 gallons of there's no way</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/324-3
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:03.020
<v Ricky Horton>to quantify that.
I know some of your guard needs come in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/325-0
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.915
<v Ricky Horton>Larger side,
it's not anything that's better to know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/325-1
01:07:06.915 --> 01:07:10.128
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's what what a bunch of guys doing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/325-2
01:07:10.128 --> 01:07:13.555
<v Ricky Horton>this,
which would be easy to be set up in shape</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/325-3
01:07:13.555 --> 01:07:17.553
<v Ricky Horton>or something,
but what what they typically end up doing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/325-4
01:07:17.553 --> 01:07:18.980
<v Ricky Horton>is let's say I have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/327-0
01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:23.577
<v Ricky Horton>As I pull one out of storage and bring it
into the work area,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/327-1
01:07:23.577 --> 01:07:27.877
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to TFSP and so I know I've got
four in storage.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/327-2
01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:32.547
<v Ricky Horton>You might still have one full one that
I'm not starting using,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/327-3
01:07:32.547 --> 01:07:38.330
<v Ricky Horton>but you know what you got in storage
versus what happened to the loose rather</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/327-4
01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:38.700
<v Ricky Horton>than.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/328-0
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.340
<v Ricky Horton>Rather than having to try upshot
furniture down,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/328-1
01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:49.501
<v Ricky Horton>track barrel by barrel and and generally
what the rest of it. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/328-2
01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Ricky Horton>that's certainly something we would do
and definitely would be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/329-0
01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:08.472
<v Ricky Horton>A quite simple process to do so.
So let's say that you got one piece,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/329-1
01:08:08.472 --> 01:08:15.340
<v Ricky Horton>there's going to be a 1010 everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/330-0
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:21.093
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, Yep. So you can download it in.
If you got 8 and you got 12,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/330-1
01:08:21.093 --> 01:08:25.657
<v Ricky Horton>you just type in quantity 8 and your
vitamin will say 20,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/330-2
01:08:25.657 --> 01:08:31.873
<v Ricky Horton>it'll say quantity 8 and then the total
quantity goes from 12 or whatever your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/330-3
01:08:31.873 --> 01:08:35.020
<v Ricky Horton>difference is and then you will just go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/331-0
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:41.803
<v Ricky Horton>Go back in there and you can receive a
whole line item or you can receive a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/331-1
01:08:41.803 --> 01:08:46.613
<v Ricky Horton>portion of the line item that's always do
the full. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/331-2
01:08:46.613 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Ricky Horton>so which I can I can show you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/334-0
01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:05.907
<v Ricky Horton>I just have to confirm that you can go on
in because you're willing to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/334-1
01:09:05.907 --> 01:09:10.523
<v Ricky Horton>We can do so.
We just need to get two lines.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/334-2
01:09:10.523 --> 01:09:16.780
<v Ricky Horton>That'll be a part of our it'll probably
be Friday next week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/335-0
01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.995
<v Ricky Horton>We'll assign to everybody in the
beginning of the week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/335-1
01:09:20.995 --> 01:09:25.447
<v Ricky Horton>I'll go through with our team,
get a list of guys that need to be on the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/335-2
01:09:25.447 --> 01:09:30.386
<v Ricky Horton>PM that don't have ways to visit signage,
and we'll get all that set up and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/335-3
01:09:30.386 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Ricky Horton>try to get a discipline 105 everyone's in
the interim.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/336-0
01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:43.299
<v Ricky Horton>Receiving, shipping and status marking.
You guys shouldn't have to do any of that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/336-1
01:09:43.299 --> 01:09:48.324
<v Ricky Horton>You guys' time tracking is your question
and everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/336-2
01:09:48.324 --> 01:09:52.380
<v Ricky Horton>So that's all that's all a separate
instance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/337-0
01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.843
<v Ricky Horton>I think you guys aren't willing to miss
that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/337-1
01:09:55.843 --> 01:10:01.102
<v Ricky Horton>So unless somebody in the management
specifically requests that they want your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/337-2
01:10:01.102 --> 01:10:05.496
<v Ricky Horton>time back into the in Tekla,
I would think you guys have come in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/337-3
01:10:05.496 --> 01:10:10.623
<v Ricky Horton>We do our contracting in here for the
shop side because of that all kinds of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/337-4
01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.220
<v Ricky Horton>our production jobs and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/338-0
01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:19.060
<v Ricky Horton>And tracking everything for hours and use
to begin some projects.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/338-1
01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.587
<v Ricky Horton>So you guys have your own separate
projects.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/338-2
01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:29.220
<v Ricky Horton>It wouldn't zero in a few minutes coming
entering time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/339-0
01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:34.590
<v Ricky Horton>I guess everybody has their own.
We're very good. So proper wise,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/339-1
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:38.812
<v Ricky Horton>they're temp employees.
We don't pay them through Vista.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/339-2
01:10:38.812 --> 01:10:44.442
<v Ricky Horton>They're their own separate entity.
Every other guy is pretty much salary at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/339-3
01:10:44.442 --> 01:10:48.220
<v Ricky Horton>that point.
It's the exception of probably Richie.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/340-0
01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:53.502
<v Ricky Horton>And he's manually entering his hours in
the in the Vista like most of the other</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/340-1
01:10:53.502 --> 01:10:56.310
<v Ricky Horton>guys.
Me and Alan don't try time through Tekla.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/340-2
01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:00.875
<v Ricky Horton>She's pretty much the only people who are
using the time tracking in Tekla is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/340-3
01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:04.620
<v Ricky Horton>production employees.
I definitely think it's something that we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/340-4
01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Ricky Horton>can have a bigger discussion and go out
and incorporated you guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/341-0
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.379
<v Ricky Horton>The individuals,
because that's one thing that this does</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/341-1
01:11:12.379 --> 01:11:16.875
<v Ricky Horton>show is all the additional types of
shipping hours that go to the labor</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/341-2
01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:19.935
<v Ricky Horton>bucket.
These guys are Vista that actually go to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/341-3
01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:23.556
<v Ricky Horton>the labor bucket.
So it gives you us a portion pulling up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/341-4
01:11:23.556 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Ricky Horton>the Vista.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/342-0
01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.470
<v Ricky Horton>This number doesn't align with the final,
right,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/342-1
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:31.716
<v Ricky Horton>with everyone else at the time or so.
I think it's where we need to go,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/342-2
01:11:31.716 --> 01:11:35.668
<v Ricky Horton>but currently right now when we've done
it, it's multiple systems.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/342-3
01:11:35.668 --> 01:11:40.091
<v Ricky Horton>We can sound like nobody here can
actually know what all the data is going</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/342-4
01:11:40.091 --> 01:11:42.980
<v Ricky Horton>to see in four different places, right,
I guess.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/343-0
01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/344-0
01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:51.706
<v Ricky Horton>But Kendall,
I will show you what your against this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/344-1
01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:58.046
<v Ricky Horton>portion will look like. Yeah, I mean,
I don't see why a lot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/344-2
01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:01.580
<v Ricky Horton>They'd have to be easier in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/345-0
01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:07.955
<v Ricky Horton>The question is if,
but if it's sounds like a majority of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/345-1
01:12:07.955 --> 01:12:15.327
<v Ricky Horton>hours you're going with it, yeah,
the majority of the hours in the only the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/345-2
01:12:15.327 --> 01:12:18.140
<v Ricky Horton>only areas where it would be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/346-0
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:18.620
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-0
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:24.374
<v Ricky Horton>Or we create additional work.
It's adding the projects that don't ever</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-1
01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:27.325
<v Ricky Horton>see production.
All the production employees are all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-2
01:12:27.325 --> 01:12:30.666
<v Ricky Horton>production jobs, shipping, receivable,
get random requests,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-3
01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:34.285
<v Ricky Horton>different oddball things where they're
just taking something in,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-4
01:12:34.285 --> 01:12:37.849
<v Ricky Horton>taking something out.
So then we would have to add all the jobs</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/347-5
01:12:37.849 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Ricky Horton>in there so that they have the ability.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/348-0
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:44.467
<v Ricky Horton>Need to track minutes.
Same thing with codings. Codings, however,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/348-1
01:12:44.467 --> 01:12:49.924
<v Ricky Horton>are being a little bit more prevalent
because they're trying to do the tracking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/348-2
01:12:49.924 --> 01:12:54.909
<v Ricky Horton>Um shifts kind of the the the rear in
between the of that because they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/348-3
01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Ricky Horton>really.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/349-0
01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:01.136
<v Ricky Horton>Shipping over the whole day and it's not,
it's not tied to a specific job is what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/349-1
01:13:01.136 --> 01:13:04.752
<v Ricky Horton>I'm hearing.
It's just a false that it's just you go</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/349-2
01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:10.279
<v Ricky Horton>spread and today you may have about six
jobs and tomorrow you may have about one</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/349-3
01:13:10.279 --> 01:13:10.620
<v Ricky Horton>jobs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/350-0
01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:16.762
<v Ricky Horton>It's just spread out over all the jobs.
Is that how it's just the overhead</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/350-1
01:13:16.762 --> 01:13:20.410
<v Ricky Horton>accounts?
Are you guys putting in two jobs now?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/350-2
01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:24.667
<v Ricky Horton>Now they're going to two jobs.
Two jobs in local. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/350-3
01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:29.380
<v Ricky Horton>but it's increasing.
We're talking in the last couple months.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/351-0
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:34.634
<v Ricky Horton>Historically,
it was just a blanket overhead and it was</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/351-1
01:13:34.634 --> 01:13:40.250
<v Ricky Horton>distributed to whoever that job's in
charge. I'll see you all. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/351-2
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.860
<v Ricky Horton>so for your guys unfortunate in this
inventory module.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/352-0
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:51.617
<v Ricky Horton>So when you open the inventory module,
you'll have all of these options</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/352-1
01:13:51.617 --> 01:13:55.287
<v Ricky Horton>available for you.
You guys probably haven't immediately</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/352-2
01:13:55.287 --> 01:13:58.442
<v Ricky Horton>move or take them stock at this immediate
point.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/352-3
01:13:58.442 --> 01:14:03.401
<v Ricky Horton>Once Christie puts his plan together,
then we put lines in the yard and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/352-4
01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:06.620
<v Ricky Horton>we've got bin locations and we've got
everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/353-0
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.728
<v Ricky Horton>That's where your removal function is
going to be incredibly useful if you guys</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/353-1
01:14:11.728 --> 01:14:16.237
<v Ricky Horton>move one project to a new radio because
if a bigger project came in and the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/353-2
01:14:16.237 --> 01:14:20.985
<v Ricky Horton>availability here is going to be better
and you want to move and shuffle things</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/353-3
01:14:20.985 --> 01:14:23.180
<v Ricky Horton>around if you move something on here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/354-0
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:29.479
<v Ricky Horton>Update the inventory location when the
saw operators at the saw that inventory</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/354-1
01:14:29.479 --> 01:14:35.224
<v Ricky Horton>location updates on their cut list and
they can see where the steel was at at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/354-2
01:14:35.224 --> 01:14:39.128
<v Ricky Horton>that point.
So in the future that will function will</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/354-3
01:14:39.128 --> 01:14:40.380
<v Ricky Horton>be super helpful.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/355-0
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:47.565
<v Ricky Horton>Once we have a very good plan in place
for what's going to be dedicated to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/355-1
01:14:47.565 --> 01:14:51.084
<v Ricky Horton>coatings,
what's going to be wear for steel,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/355-2
01:14:51.084 --> 01:14:54.994
<v Ricky Horton>because they are doing rows,
bins and everything,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/355-3
01:14:54.994 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Ricky Horton>we want everything to be very.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/356-0
01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:03.892
<v Ricky Horton>And so for now, the move function,
we have our old categories for what I had</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/356-1
01:15:03.892 --> 01:15:09.152
<v Ricky Horton>originally knocked out and they are,
that's borderline relevant.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/356-2
01:15:09.152 --> 01:15:15.140
<v Ricky Horton>So the take from stop portion that you
guys shouldn't really have to use.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/357-0
01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.124
<v Ricky Horton>That would be more prevalent in line.
So a field guy came in,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/357-1
01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:23.465
<v Ricky Horton>found a six foot or 8 foot piece of
material.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/357-2
01:15:23.465 --> 01:15:29.130
<v Ricky Horton>He verified that he can take it and
confirmed with us that it's not allocated</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/357-3
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:33.125
<v Ricky Horton>to a project.
You could then go to the take and stock,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/357-4
01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.940
<v Ricky Horton>find that six foot piece.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/358-0
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.306
<v Ricky Horton>It take from stock.
That should also give you the option to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/358-1
01:15:38.306 --> 01:15:41.700
<v Ricky Horton>load it onto the load or just directly
yank it out of the system,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/358-2
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.660
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not going to tracking anymore
and they take it load it up and it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/359-0
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.674
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so handling is a function that you guys</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/359-1
01:15:49.674 --> 01:15:54.579
<v Ricky Horton>track. Who does the handling?
Is it chipping and receiving or is it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/359-2
01:15:54.579 --> 01:15:59.772
<v Ricky Horton>welders? It's multiple facets.
It's my saw operators picking it up from</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/359-3
01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:02.801
<v Ricky Horton>the yard,
picking out the saw and they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/359-4
01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:04.460
<v Ricky Horton>classified as handling.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/360-0
01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.687
<v Ricky Horton>And then vice versa.
If the fabric is original material into</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/360-1
01:16:08.687 --> 01:16:13.346
<v Ricky Horton>the the the shop run on the stall,
then that's classified as happening,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/360-2
01:16:13.346 --> 01:16:18.910
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not the shipping perceiving also.
So that's all shop happening. It does not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/360-3
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:23.180
<v Ricky Horton>It starts to give any trouble with there
that will be applied to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/361-0
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.282
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
And we're usually two weeks behind Vista,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/361-1
01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:33.228
<v Ricky Horton>so I don't get a full synopsis of their
time until end of the month, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/361-2
01:16:33.228 --> 01:16:37.744
<v Ricky Horton>but so you guys have a lot of guys
trained to drive for us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/361-3
01:16:37.744 --> 01:16:39.700
<v Ricky Horton>It's they should agree to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/362-0
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:53.662
<v Ricky Horton>So moving on to the next category of load,
this would be we're in a free build on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/362-1
01:16:53.662 --> 01:16:55.340
<v Ricky Horton>load list.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/363-0
01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:01.916
<v Ricky Horton>You can take that load portion and
physically load the items on to the truck</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/363-1
01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:05.790
<v Ricky Horton>against the four levels prebuilt to the
system.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/363-2
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.180
<v Ricky Horton>So we can go in here and kind of show you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/364-0
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.300
<v Ricky Horton>What we have here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/365-0
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.740
<v Ricky Horton>So if we throw like a whole thing on one
load list,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/365-1
01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:30.427
<v Ricky Horton>they can then go in and add each member
as they're loading it on the truck. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/365-2
01:17:30.427 --> 01:17:37.357
<v Ricky Horton>And that would that then build a separate
load list now for that? Yeah, that I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/365-3
01:17:37.357 --> 01:17:38.580
<v Ricky Horton>that's for you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/366-0
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:43.914
<v Ricky Horton>Truck will be on the truck and there's a
check box there on the bottom left hand</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/366-1
01:17:43.914 --> 01:17:48.577
<v Ricky Horton>corner called load on the side.
You uncheck that and the system says OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/366-2
01:17:48.577 --> 01:17:51.963
<v Ricky Horton>you created a plan.
Then they come by saying loaded,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/366-3
01:17:51.963 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Ricky Horton>loaded that piece, loaded that piece,
loaded that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/368-0
01:17:55.220 --> 01:18:00.386
<v Ricky Horton>Now this right here is one of the in the
actual inventory of their trucks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/368-1
01:18:00.386 --> 01:18:04.518
<v Ricky Horton>So that's like I said,
nobody got this for a quarter angle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/368-2
01:18:04.518 --> 01:18:09.890
<v Ricky Horton>I can select that and it doesn't all,
removes the inventory of the job. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/368-3
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Ricky Horton>I'm ready to be in the shipping portion
of the project to the loading.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/369-0
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:21.580
<v Ricky Horton>If you if you prove what it holds like
you're talking about, which is not always.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/370-0
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.900
<v Ricky Horton>Not always.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/371-0
01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:30.677
<v Ricky Horton>If you touch, yes, I'm talking late,
but it'll be something, right? But well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/371-1
01:18:30.677 --> 01:18:33.517
<v Ricky Horton>you got assemblies that have wonky,
you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/371-2
01:18:33.517 --> 01:18:37.840
<v Ricky Horton>figurations and they just don't line up
the way, you know? Yep. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/371-3
01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.100
<v Ricky Horton>they might work, but you know,
they might have some sticking out or.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/372-0
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.891
<v Ricky Horton>Or it's too tall, so you have to pull.
But if you do that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/372-1
01:18:46.891 --> 01:18:51.442
<v Ricky Horton>I highly suggest you start using the
shipping gallon here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/372-2
01:18:51.442 --> 01:18:55.453
<v Ricky Horton>It's about pre-building a truck next
Friday, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/372-3
01:18:55.453 --> 01:19:01.392
<v Ricky Horton>Then I usually try everybody in the
organization and the guys at the yard to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/372-4
01:19:01.392 --> 01:19:01.700
<v Ricky Horton>say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/373-0
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:07.319
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care about what shift a few weeks
from the matter, but what shift tomorrow?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/373-1
01:19:07.319 --> 01:19:11.993
<v Ricky Horton>I see, I see the load on the calendar.
I pull it up, nothing on my list.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/373-2
01:19:11.993 --> 01:19:15.258
<v Ricky Horton>I'm loading it up, getting loaded, loaded,
loaded,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/373-3
01:19:15.258 --> 01:19:19.420
<v Ricky Horton>loaded forward and so it works off the
calendar which gives you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/374-0
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:23.394
<v Ricky Horton>A lot more information, so it's really,
really nice.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/374-1
01:19:23.394 --> 01:19:26.460
<v Ricky Horton>So I think if you want scheduling the
work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/375-0
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.998
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
shipping is going to need to be part of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/375-1
01:19:30.998 --> 01:19:35.121
<v Ricky Horton>it. Yeah. I mean,
we would have such a massive backlog that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/375-2
01:19:35.121 --> 01:19:40.892
<v Ricky Horton>we're, you know, shipping guys everywhere.
We just didn't have the resources to all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/375-3
01:19:40.892 --> 01:19:42.060
<v Ricky Horton>the trucks, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/377-0
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:54.875
<v Ricky Horton>So so here in the inventory in the
receiving portion of it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/377-1
01:19:54.875 --> 01:20:00.913
<v Ricky Horton>This is where you see your receiver.
You can see your PO volume here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/377-2
01:20:00.913 --> 01:20:07.985
<v Ricky Horton>This will reference all your POS what's
included on it and then this is where you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/377-3
01:20:07.985 --> 01:20:09.020
<v Ricky Horton>can you can.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/378-0
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Ricky Horton>On your quantities,
type in your heat number and then click</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/378-1
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Ricky Horton>receive down below.
That will receive in four with that heat</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/378-2
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Ricky Horton>number. And then once you do that,
the three remaining will still be up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/378-3
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.820
<v Ricky Horton>there.
You can enter that heat number received</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/378-4
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Ricky Horton>and then when Bob was back to Peter and
Paul, can we run?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/379-0
01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:33.038
<v Ricky Horton>No, you're good. So on the load side,
I I'm just going to pick from stock.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/379-1
01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:38.306
<v Ricky Horton>If it's not going on the list and they're
just taking it from the yard and it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/379-2
01:20:38.306 --> 01:20:42.980
<v Ricky Horton>going, then take it from stock,
we'll pull it from from the inventory.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/380-0
01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:49.733
<v Ricky Horton>Loads where you can visibly load
inventory in the RML load and ship that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/380-1
01:20:49.733 --> 01:20:53.658

<v Ricky Horton>where incoming steel.
You'll have transparency of that show.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/381-0
01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:06.075

<v Ricky Horton>This is the heat number and then the
operator instantly knows at the stop, hey,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/382-1

<v Ricky Horton>find out where it is and once we
establish the bin locations and the grid</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/382-3
01:21:27.922 --> 01:21:31.140
<v Ricky Horton>line in the yard and where things are
going to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/383-0

<v Ricky Horton>and then your section location and then
that'll update on the average that was in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/383-2
01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:48.620
<v Ricky Horton>this area and then they know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/384-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/384-2
01:21:56.063 --> 01:22:00.851
<v Ricky Horton>They're going to arrive over there and
start eating that stuff behind the foot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/384-3
01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:05.100

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/385-0
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.759
<v Ricky Horton>Define the location where they put things
in the system.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/385-1

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/388-2
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.925
<v Ricky Horton>each. Yeah,

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/388-3
01:22:57.925 --> 01:22:58.420

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/389-1
01:23:03.524 --> 01:23:08.212
<v Ricky Horton>coatings and then anything that's
complete in between the steel yard,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/389-2
01:23:08.212 --> 01:23:13.503
<v Ricky Horton>the current steel yard and coatings is
completely ready to go along the trail.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/389-3
01:23:13.503 --> 01:23:15.780
<v Ricky Horton>How do you prevent addiction jobs?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/390-0
01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.326
<v Ricky Horton>Um, brief text.
I was gonna say it's the the 5 pieces,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/390-1
01:23:19.326 --> 01:23:23.926
<v Ricky Horton>which every you know if it's a large
sequence or coder lot, we'll do uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/390-2
01:23:23.926 --> 01:23:27.896
<v Ricky Horton>ribbon identification.
But typically we have all our data tags</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/390-3
01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:32.180
<v Ricky Horton>that we'll have from our QC that shows
job sequence log piece mark.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/391-0
01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:36.998
<v Ricky Horton>And then they're going through based off
of the list that these guys put together</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/391-1
01:23:36.998 --> 01:23:39.966
<v Ricky Horton>and you'll want for one day.
We're taking 10 piece of over.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/391-2
01:23:39.966 --> 01:23:43.380
<v Ricky Horton>We only get 9 and then we'll go ahead and
see if they're doing this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/392-0
01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:48.896
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, the facility is small.
I'm used to working on four acres,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/392-1
01:23:48.896 --> 01:23:54.094
<v Ricky Horton>so I guess it doesn't really get lost
here, right? Yeah, that's not nice.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/392-2
01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:58.730
<v Ricky Horton>We're seeing, you know,
a piece of plate falls off the pallet and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/392-3
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:01.820
<v Ricky Horton>trying to face it,
but it's black for sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/393-0
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.781
<v Ricky Horton>So this inventory module,
this is the home screen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/393-1
01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:12.499
<v Ricky Horton>Inventory risk is where you're going to
go for moving things,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/393-2
01:24:12.499 --> 01:24:18.283
<v Ricky Horton>taking things from stock, loading things,
loading raw steel onto trucks and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/393-3
01:24:18.283 --> 01:24:19.500
<v Ricky Horton>receiving steel.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/394-0
01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:26.019
<v Ricky Horton>So that will be the main governing
portion of your report job as a shipping</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/394-1
01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:29.844
<v Ricky Horton>and receiving personnel.
In addition to that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/394-2
01:24:29.844 --> 01:24:35.580
<v Ricky Horton>you'll also have this work packages
portion, work packages projects.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/395-0
01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:40.520
<v Ricky Horton>Anything that's pointing out of us from
the bath shop is going to have a work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/395-1
01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.357
<v Ricky Horton>package,
so that's probably a better place for you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/395-2
01:24:43.357 --> 01:24:47.696
<v Ricky Horton>to look and see that it's going to be
broken up in the way we format our work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/395-3
01:24:47.696 --> 01:24:52.202
<v Ricky Horton>packages to how we want it to come out of
production and the way it comes out of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/395-4
01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:54.260
<v Ricky Horton>production is how we want it shipped.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/396-0
01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.469
<v Ricky Horton>So that would be your best reference is
to go into work packages.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/396-1
01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:03.409
<v Ricky Horton>Have we shipped every loads for the
landowner yet? No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/396-2
01:25:03.409 --> 01:25:08.711
<v Ricky Horton>we have to watch it a month. OK,
so I'll hold them now because I prebuilt</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/396-3
01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:10.860
<v Ricky Horton>all of the loads for that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/399-0
01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.467
<v Ricky Horton>So we have all of our work packages in
here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/399-1
01:25:24.467 --> 01:25:30.523
<v Ricky Horton>You'll click into your sequence and then
down here in your shipping category is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/399-2
01:25:30.523 --> 01:25:32.340
<v Ricky Horton>where you can reference.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/400-0
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:38.318
<v Ricky Horton>Anything associated for build loads in
this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/400-1
01:25:38.318 --> 01:25:44.428
<v Ricky Horton>So we can see here that we've got one
load, load 19 that's not started yet.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/400-2
01:25:44.428 --> 01:25:49.975
<v Ricky Horton>We can click into this load and this
would be where you can make the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/400-3
01:25:49.975 --> 01:25:51.180
<v Ricky Horton>designation of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/401-0
01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:58.900
<v Ricky Horton>Removing adding additional that are in
blood, but unless we're in blue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/402-0
01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:03.881
<v Ricky Horton>Then you just check which ones you can
load. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/402-1
01:26:03.881 --> 01:26:09.422
<v Ricky Horton>so here or if you needed to remove it
from the load because some items not</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/402-2
01:26:09.422 --> 01:26:13.264
<v Ricky Horton>gonna fit.
If you remove this from the load because</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/402-3
01:26:13.264 --> 01:26:17.771
<v Ricky Horton>it's not gonna fit,
my computer will update with what didn't</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/402-4
01:26:17.771 --> 01:26:18.140
<v Ricky Horton>ship.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/403-0
01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.392
<v Ricky Horton>And then when you guys mark the ship,
it updates everything and we'll put it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/403-1
01:26:23.392 --> 01:26:28.023
<v Ricky Horton>back and I can reassign it to a new load
and then we can have a transparent</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/403-2
01:26:28.023 --> 01:26:32.289
<v Ricky Horton>tracking of what went out,
what didn't go out and what's where. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/403-3
01:26:32.289 --> 01:26:36.128
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to send a lot.
It's like you know some piece of that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/403-4
01:26:36.128 --> 01:26:38.260
<v Ricky Horton>ship right? Where the hell is that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/404-0
01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.975
<v Ricky Horton>And you're looking for B none.
Hit the little heartbeat symbol over</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/404-1
01:26:42.975 --> 01:26:47.620
<v Ricky Horton>there, whatever that symbol is.
That tells you all the stations as</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/404-2
01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.711
<v Ricky Horton>opposed to builders.
So you have this building to see. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/404-3
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:53.860
<v Ricky Horton>well, everything's been fed up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/405-0
01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:59.413
<v Ricky Horton>Two of them have been welded.
You know exactly where to get it figured</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/405-1
01:26:59.413 --> 01:27:05.474
<v Ricky Horton>out. Yeah, this has got **** tomorrow.
Is it going to get done or not? You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/405-2
01:27:05.474 --> 01:27:10.413
<v Ricky Horton>if you run the whole shop,
you can kind of at this same time that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/405-3
01:27:10.413 --> 01:27:13.780
<v Ricky Horton>you're trying to find the calories like
any.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/406-0
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:19.620
<v Ricky Horton>Looking for because it could be a W 8 by
28 with three clips or with five clips.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/408-0
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.061
<v Ricky Horton>So you're then just reference. Well,
I'm just saying it's the shipping guys</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/408-1
01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:30.552
<v Ricky Horton>are always told to go load the trucks,
but unless the order is consolidated by</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/408-2
01:27:30.552 --> 01:27:34.930
<v Ricky Horton>somebody that either dedicates an area or
whatever, the shipping guys don't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/408-3
01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:37.260
<v Ricky Horton>There's so much that you guys are moving.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/409-0
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:41.877
<v Ricky Horton>But they don't really know exactly what
the piece looks like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/409-1
01:27:41.877 --> 01:27:45.273
<v Ricky Horton>There's lots of pieces that look really
similar.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/409-2
01:27:45.273 --> 01:27:49.777
<v Ricky Horton>So and then you get the model piece on
the wrong trucks. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/409-3
01:27:49.777 --> 01:27:54.420
<v Ricky Horton>I see that just happened more than I'd
like to. Yeah, these parts.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/410-0
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.452
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that'd be another area where these work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/410-1
01:27:57.452 --> 01:28:02.376
<v Ricky Horton>packages are really helpful is if they're
in here and they're trying to look at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/410-2
01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:05.330
<v Ricky Horton>everything.
Once I figure out why are the lines</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/410-3
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:09.454
<v Ricky Horton>connected at this point,
I'll get to the bottom of that before the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/410-4
01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:10.500
<v Ricky Horton>end of this week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/411-0
01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:17.099
<v Ricky Horton>But they can always pull this up and have
a very clear reference.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/411-1
01:28:17.099 --> 01:28:21.523
<v Ricky Horton>I'm looking for a B5,
I'll shoot at 60 foot long.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/411-2
01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:26.300
<v Ricky Horton>This thing should stand out.
So I'm up here and then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/412-0
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:33.922
<v Ricky Horton>And then they can go right back to their
shipping and and then go back into their</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/412-1
01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:38.719
<v Ricky Horton>globe. OK, Yep,
I have B9 and and this will show the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/412-2
01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:43.244
<v Ricky Horton>length,
but it's only going to show the length of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/412-3
01:28:43.244 --> 01:28:46.140
<v Ricky Horton>the main number. So if the main.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/413-0
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:55.793
<v Ricky Horton>Member is spliced with the subpart to add
to your total length.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/413-1
01:28:55.793 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Ricky Horton>That might not always be the exact. Yeah,
so. So that is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/414-0
01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.294
<v Ricky Horton>Helpful to a certain sense,
but once you start getting on the really</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/414-1
01:29:10.294 --> 01:29:13.652
<v Ricky Horton>big stuff,
unless the main member is specifically</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/414-2
01:29:13.652 --> 01:29:18.757
<v Ricky Horton>detailed out as that full length and we
run it as a splice package in here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/414-3
01:29:18.757 --> 01:29:21.980
<v Ricky Horton>we keep that raw length the folio for
this one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/415-0
01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:28.651
<v Ricky Horton>The detail package anticipated a spice,
so the main number was actually a sub</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/415-1
01:29:28.651 --> 01:29:33.775
<v Ricky Horton>portion of your full length.
So there is a way for us to leave a main</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/415-2
01:29:33.775 --> 01:29:38.973
<v Ricky Horton>number at a full length and create a
spice package and slice the parts</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/415-3
01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Ricky Horton>together and keep that main number length
that way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/416-0
01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:55.760
<v Ricky Horton>So it won't always be like this. So,
so it'll be project by project basis,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/416-1
01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.100
<v Ricky Horton>but then your.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/417-0
01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:04.714
<v Ricky Horton>Best reference is gonna be referencing so
which you can pull up all these different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/417-1
01:30:04.714 --> 01:30:08.078
<v Ricky Horton>things.
You guys will have visibility tunes in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/417-2
01:30:08.078 --> 01:30:12.517
<v Ricky Horton>here and and you guys can see by area of
work and everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/417-3
01:30:12.517 --> 01:30:15.380
<v Ricky Horton>What's required drawings and you can go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/418-0
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.060
<v Ricky Horton>Back to your.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/419-0
01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:23.067
<v Ricky Horton>Back to your overview, assemblies,
material status,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/419-1
01:30:23.067 --> 01:30:26.980
<v Ricky Horton>shipping status and let's see what they.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/420-0
01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Ricky Horton>Dashboards.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/421-0
01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:35.236
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna go to our shipping calendar.
This is what Ricky was referencing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/421-1
01:30:35.236 --> 01:30:39.571
<v Ricky Horton>earlier. Whenever we recreate globe lists,
we have all of them on here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/421-2
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:44.327
<v Ricky Horton>So all of the line number ones I had on
here and then once we figured out Chad</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/421-3
01:30:44.327 --> 01:30:48.180
<v Ricky Horton>made a seat request to have all 327 tons
delivered in one week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/422-0
01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.797
<v Ricky Horton>I grabbed them,
dragged them into the new day because</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/422-1
01:30:51.797 --> 01:30:55.998
<v Ricky Horton>they're already built in there.
Everything's where it needed to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/422-2
01:30:55.998 --> 01:31:01.127
<v Ricky Horton>So I just started dragging, reorganizing.
But if you guys are in here and you know</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/422-3
01:31:01.127 --> 01:31:02.980
<v Ricky Horton>something's not going to ship.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/423-0
01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:07.660
<v Ricky Horton>If this bring the bring the level up,
hit the paint bug and bring up the legend.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/424-0
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:14.004
<v Ricky Horton>So the orange ones are in progress.
Blue is essential,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/424-1
01:31:14.004 --> 01:31:18.964
<v Ricky Horton>but you can see the 0% at the bottom.
That's 0% says pieces that are planned</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/424-2
01:31:18.964 --> 01:31:23.925
<v Ricky Horton>for that. Nothing's been loaded yet.
So whereas the orange one there is 100%</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/424-3
01:31:23.925 --> 01:31:28.627
<v Ricky Horton>loaded and then you got green,
which is it's already shipped in red that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/424-4
01:31:28.627 --> 01:31:29.980
<v Ricky Horton>was supposed to ship.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/425-0
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:34.065
<v Ricky Horton>For some reason.
So that's why I didn't mark it though.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/425-1
01:31:34.065 --> 01:31:37.712
<v Ricky Horton>So and then from here,
you know tomorrow's the 12,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/425-2
01:31:37.712 --> 01:31:41.073
<v Ricky Horton>everything's scheduled,
nothing's been loaded,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/425-3
01:31:41.073 --> 01:31:45.220
<v Ricky Horton>nothing's been confirmed.
You can go in here, reschedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/426-0
01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:52.023
<v Ricky Horton>Push the Saturday if you needed to push
it to Monday and then if you go in here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/426-1
01:31:52.023 --> 01:31:58.455
<v Ricky Horton>this will populate back down here and and
then the the visibility will all be there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/426-2
01:31:58.455 --> 01:32:04.580
<v Ricky Horton>for for everybody involved on or do it
the sexy way, but not there to be great.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/427-0
01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:08.740
<v Ricky Horton>And it said, it's right,
who's allowed to be study?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/428-0
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Ricky Horton>Up the issue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/429-0
01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/430-0
01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:14.340
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/431-0
01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:20.828
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's something like that.
And that would be just the process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/431-1
01:32:20.828 --> 01:32:25.368
<v Ricky Horton>So this would be nice for.
I don't know how you get communication.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/431-2
01:32:25.368 --> 01:32:29.502
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, what's going on tomorrow?
What's going on the next day?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/431-3
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:31.060
<v Ricky Horton>What's going on Monday?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/432-0
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:34.621
<v Ricky Horton>This,
this will be a good communication home</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/432-1
01:32:34.621 --> 01:32:39.245
<v Ricky Horton>for that. You know exactly what it is,
what it's supposed to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/432-2
01:32:39.245 --> 01:32:43.940
<v Ricky Horton>How do the field guys know what's coming?
They use this calendar.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/433-0
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:45.300
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/436-0
01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.176
<v Ricky Horton>So on this specifically we'll set up
during our kickoff,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/436-1
01:33:04.176 --> 01:33:09.110
<v Ricky Horton>we schedule the current date that was
expected by the build forwarder customer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/436-2
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:13.242
<v Ricky Horton>If there are any changes,
the build foreman or project manager for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/436-3
01:33:13.242 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Ricky Horton>that job will reach out between the
shipping manager and the customer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-0
01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:22.556
<v Ricky Horton>Um, it accelerates it. Of course,
we have to make sure that we're on par</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-1
01:33:22.556 --> 01:33:24.983
<v Ricky Horton>with that together.
Are they talking to you,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-2
01:33:24.983 --> 01:33:28.272
<v Ricky Horton>the field construction guy?
Like if we're still at the back,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-3
01:33:28.272 --> 01:33:31.345
<v Ricky Horton>talking to you,
they'll they'll talk to Paul to schedule</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-4
01:33:31.345 --> 01:33:33.717
<v Ricky Horton>push,
but if it's an accelerated adjustment</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-5
01:33:33.717 --> 01:33:36.898
<v Ricky Horton>forward or inward,
then they'll communicate with us to see</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/438-6
01:33:36.898 --> 01:33:38.300
<v Ricky Horton>if we need a wrap for him.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/439-0
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:43.047
<v Ricky Horton>9 times out of 10 recently,
if they just communicate with Paul,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/439-1
01:33:43.047 --> 01:33:48.152
<v Ricky Horton>I hit our original schedule.
If you pushed it out, you know my point,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/439-2
01:33:48.152 --> 01:33:52.527
<v Ricky Horton>did I make the suggestion?
These guys are just in the demo,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/439-3
01:33:52.527 --> 01:33:56.100
<v Ricky Horton>but you're you know what you know.
You're quick.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/440-0
01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:09.325
<v Ricky Horton>Their their heads spilled around.
What's your question? You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/440-1
01:34:09.325 --> 01:34:16.020
<v Ricky Horton>that's what I said should question.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/441-0
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.100
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's great.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/442-0
01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:23.260
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's most people are kind of like me,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/442-1
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.769
<v Ricky Horton>a listing my hands,
like I can watch you do it. And I'm like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/442-2
01:34:27.769 --> 01:34:32.497
<v Ricky Horton>OK, let me play that and then I'll,
I'll get it right, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/442-3
01:34:32.497 --> 01:34:35.260
<v Ricky Horton>so it might be. So you say you get it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/443-0
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.180
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/445-0

<v Ricky Horton>Security number.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/447-0

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Ricky Horton>And probably going to see when you give
me all set up this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/454-0
01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:38.380
<v Ricky Horton>See if it was.
It says it's not like the next.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/455-0
01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:40.500
<v Ricky Horton>My best.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/457-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/457-1
01:36:03.422 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Ricky Horton>I don't need support.</v>

01:37:17.212 --> 01:37:21.276

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/467-2
01:37:21.276 --> 01:37:22.140

I think it was white parent off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/471-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/475-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/476-0
01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/479-0
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.677
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's filter and value list if you type</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/479-1
01:38:45.677 --> 01:38:51.239
<v Ricky Horton>them. Yeah. What's that?
That'd be that'd be the job, right? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/479-2
01:38:51.239 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Ricky Horton>So now, now that you have your filter set,
you need the accident filter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/480-0
01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:05.300
<v Ricky Horton>You'll see right there that's cleaning,
right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/481-0
01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:21.447
<v Ricky Horton>Unless you want your invention or any
other information.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/481-1
01:39:21.447 --> 01:39:29.540
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to start the DOW,
you can raise that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/482-0
01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:47.363
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not sure what, but yeah, no,
it was just like the guys that are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/482-1
01:39:47.363 --> 01:39:49.420
<v Ricky Horton>painting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/483-0
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:55.588
<v Ricky Horton>And then push your key. See that back.
If you were to receive the four or 5-10</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/483-1
01:39:55.588 --> 01:39:59.140
<v Ricky Horton>line items and they were all going to say,
well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/483-2
01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:05.230
<v Ricky Horton>let's say build blanket and you could hit
build blanket here that doesn't offer two</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/483-3
01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:09.580
<v Ricky Horton>line items rather than you have to type
10 different items.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/484-0
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.863
<v Ricky Horton>So see the same material comes in and it
has the same sign.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/484-1
01:40:12.863 --> 01:40:16.973
<v Ricky Horton>Just go ahead and automatically put that
already in there. So when I locked in,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/484-2
01:40:16.973 --> 01:40:19.952
<v Ricky Horton>I just pushed that and it goes to there.
Yeah, you would.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/484-3
01:40:19.952 --> 01:40:22.213
<v Ricky Horton>You would just selected all the line
items,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/484-4
01:40:22.213 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Ricky Horton>put your heat number in because they're
unique for a lot, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/485-0
01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:30.922
<v Ricky Horton>And then when you come to batch in it,
get the build blade and get the build</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/485-1
01:40:30.922 --> 01:40:33.898
<v Ricky Horton>blade here rather than on each line line.
OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/485-2
01:40:33.898 --> 01:40:37.133
<v Ricky Horton>And that does it for all the lot of those
shares.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/485-3
01:40:37.133 --> 01:40:40.691
<v Ricky Horton>So and then I can switch that up every
time. Yep, Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/485-4
01:40:40.691 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Ricky Horton>And then now it's slow down receipt.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/486-0
01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:51.308
<v Ricky Horton>Those is gone.
They don't hear the like if you have a PO</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/486-1
01:40:51.308 --> 01:40:56.882
<v Ricky Horton>part of what you see today,
then when you come back in tomorrow,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/486-2
01:40:56.882 --> 01:40:58.940
<v Ricky Horton>they're see what's left.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/487-0
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.314
<v Ricky Horton>That's it. Yep.
And then when they're down the line,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/487-1
01:41:03.314 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Ricky Horton>once we figure out the movie and all that,
then we'll be important to detail on that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/487-2
01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:10.721
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
Once you guys start getting deeper into</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/487-3
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:13.245
<v Ricky Horton>that,
then you can go into your move tab and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/487-4
01:41:13.245 --> 01:41:16.780
<v Ricky Horton>then implement it in here.
We can go ahead and make an update.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/488-0
01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:25.730
<v Ricky Horton>Locations.
So here's the I believe that the bottom</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/488-1
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:37.820
<v Ricky Horton>is at the moment and the missing label.
Just your location, your section location.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-0
01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:42.035
<v Ricky Horton>So in that same receiving portion,
you'll be able to assign the location.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-1
01:41:42.035 --> 01:41:45.307
<v Ricky Horton>So if you already know and we got,
we got all that steel,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-2
01:41:45.307 --> 01:41:48.862
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to go right here.
Here's my bin, here's my section.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-3
01:41:48.862 --> 01:41:52.529
<v Ricky Horton>You can go in, receive it,
and it'll go right into that portion.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-4
01:41:52.529 --> 01:41:56.365
<v Ricky Horton>You know that's not going to be in the
boom, so if you can't do it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/489-5
01:41:56.365 --> 01:41:57.380
<v Ricky Horton>nothing like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/490-0
01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:04.648
<v Ricky Horton>Right now we don't have big rock out on
there. So for any of this, all right,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/490-1
01:42:04.648 --> 01:42:10.803
<v Ricky Horton>I started using that. Oh yeah,
we're all obviously along with yourself.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/490-2
01:42:10.803 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Ricky Horton>I got to get him logging.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/491-0
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:20.705
<v Ricky Horton>So early part of next week plans to get
tablets to all the questions that we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/491-1
01:42:20.705 --> 01:42:26.127
<v Ricky Horton>needed and by Friday of next week I'm
going to take a list of who has EPM bill</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/491-2
01:42:26.127 --> 01:42:28.460
<v Ricky Horton>logins and purchasing the license.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/492-0
01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:36.059
<v Ricky Horton>That's the average.
The trick reports can be clonings because</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/492-1
01:42:36.059 --> 01:42:41.468
<v Ricky Horton>they're kind of personal.
They don't have to do like we did with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/492-2
01:42:41.468 --> 01:42:46.460
<v Ricky Horton>the shop originally,
but when we got to D3 create an e-mail</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/492-3
01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:50.620
<v Ricky Horton>for them and then give them their
audience still.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/493-0
01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:57.202
<v Ricky Horton>So that's what we learned now.
So low portion is where you would load</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/493-1
01:42:57.202 --> 01:43:04.310
<v Ricky Horton>material that's in the yard or somebody
had a wall and stick or say somebody</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/493-2
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:09.940
<v Ricky Horton>would call him and go ahead and shipping
or or just load it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/494-0
01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:15.597
<v Ricky Horton>So let's take a line for example.
You have that one load that we're looking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/494-1
01:43:15.597 --> 01:43:20.871
<v Ricky Horton>at really that still has to go.
I need a 8 by 8 by half. You go in there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/494-2
01:43:20.871 --> 01:43:26.431
<v Ricky Horton>you filter for 8 by 1/2 and you go,
actually there's a 15 foot piece out here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/494-3
01:43:26.431 --> 01:43:29.780
<v Ricky Horton>with that work. You can go in there,
grab the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/495-0
01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:33.432
<v Ricky Horton>That piece and added to that list right
back there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/495-1
01:43:33.432 --> 01:43:39.330
<v Ricky Horton>So when you're gonna ship out that load,
you have load built and it's an admin. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/495-2
01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:44.245
<v Ricky Horton>that's what that portion's for.
I'll be using this as well too. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/495-3
01:43:44.245 --> 01:43:47.264
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
that'll be in in instances where the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/495-4
01:43:47.264 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Ricky Horton>field guys, hey, I need this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/496-0
01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:54.559
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you would do.
So that's taking it out of our stock and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/496-1
01:43:54.559 --> 01:43:58.835
<v Ricky Horton>putting it up for the months. OK,
the stock portion here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/496-2
01:43:58.835 --> 01:44:04.069
<v Ricky Horton>that's where I feel that comes in.
I need the six foot run here in our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/496-3
01:44:04.069 --> 01:44:07.312
<v Ricky Horton>convention system.
So if it's under 6 foot,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/496-4
01:44:07.312 --> 01:44:08.860
<v Ricky Horton>it's very good scrap.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/497-0
01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:13.886
<v Ricky Horton>And they don't have to be allowed,
they just want to take it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/497-1
01:44:13.886 --> 01:44:18.371

You can grab that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/497-3
01:44:22.716 --> 01:44:26.220
<v Ricky Horton>remove it from the system and send them
on board.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/498-0
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.281
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
And then I'm going to say the power</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/498-1
01:44:29.281 --> 01:44:34.572
<v Ricky Horton>received is for bothering the building.
It's been received outside. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/498-2
01:44:34.572 --> 01:44:38.577
<v Ricky Horton>so since it's been received all the
building there now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/498-3
01:44:38.577 --> 01:44:41.580
<v Ricky Horton>scanning is on the PR number and the dash.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/499-0
01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.552
<v Ricky Horton>OK,

01:44:44.552 --> 01:44:48.697
<v Ricky Horton>should be happening with this is if if
you get calls all day about, hey,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/499-2

<v Ricky Horton>we received this, can we get that,
tell them to shut up and you're looking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/499-3
01:44:52.956 --> 01:44:56.931
<v Ricky Horton>in the system because you updated, right?
Yeah, I mean, and honestly,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/499-4
01:44:56.931 --> 01:45:01.133
<v Ricky Horton>that's the way it should happen.
This should be the communication told to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/499-5
01:45:01.133 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Ricky Horton>everybody.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/500-0
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:06.082
<v Ricky Horton>They shouldn't have to come to you to
figure that out, right? Look, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/500-1

01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:11.867
<v Ricky Horton>They could have figured it out, right?
Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/500-3
01:45:11.867 --> 01:45:16.642
<v Ricky Horton>So that's really what should be happening.
So it should be our helping guide with it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/500-4
01:45:16.642 --> 01:45:17.540

<v Ricky Horton>It's as soon as you click enter on that
his purchase order in there no longer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/501-1
01:45:22.603 --> 01:45:26.513
<v Ricky Horton>And he can pull that.
I've shown him how to pull the overview</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/501-2
01:45:26.513 --> 01:45:30.802
<v Ricky Horton>material or expected material.
He can repull that expected material</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/501-3
01:45:30.802 --> 01:45:32.820
<v Ricky Horton>report for the day if he'd like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/502-0

<v Ricky Horton>it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/503-1
01:45:53.355 --> 01:45:57.070
<v Ricky Horton>transparency of the filters.
You got to flip my job number,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/503-2

01:47:03.153 --> 01:47:07.483
<v Ricky Horton>And if you put that little block on the
cluster to the set shipped,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/507-2

01:47:24.044 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Ricky Horton>see. That's all. If you have permissions,
you can unshift it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/509-0

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.140
<v Ricky Horton>So as long as we prebuilt to load.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/510-0
01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.970

<v Ricky Horton>for as you confirm them and you guys are
pulling them to your staging areas so you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/510-2
01:47:55.898 --> 01:47:59.402

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/512-0
01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.904
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if you can do that rather.
You're in the dashboards.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/512-1
01:48:05.904 --> 01:48:11.242
<v Ricky Horton>We'll go to the calendar because you're
on the area and the calendar. Shipping.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/512-2
01:48:11.242 --> 01:48:14.444
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and you'll see what we were looking at on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/512-3
01:48:14.444 --> 01:48:17.380
<v Ricky Horton>screen.
We might be formatting a little bit</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/512-4
01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:17.980
<v Ricky Horton>positive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/513-0
01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.940
<v Ricky Horton>Scroll down to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/514-0
01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:24.872
<v Ricky Horton>Today or the next day. There we go.
There should be loadings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/514-1
01:48:24.872 --> 01:48:29.373
<v Ricky Horton>So like that one is not loaded,
you can get the three dots on it and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/514-2
01:48:29.373 --> 01:48:31.380
<v Ricky Horton>we can get all the details, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/515-0
01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:39.696
<v Ricky Horton>So now you got the list the the real it
says it hasn't been loaded again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/515-1
01:48:39.696 --> 01:48:44.436
<v Ricky Horton>So if if you're like OK and you're
loading that and you come back and you'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/515-2
01:48:44.436 --> 01:48:48.437
<v Ricky Horton>get that loading button.
Now you got a check box and you're just</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/515-3
01:48:48.437 --> 01:48:51.392
<v Ricky Horton>checking one section loaded.
So just check one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/515-4
01:48:51.392 --> 01:48:54.100
<v Ricky Horton>We will let you be able to check
something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/516-0
01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:59.306
<v Ricky Horton>And then see that you load selected.
So you just as you get uploaded you can</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/516-1
01:48:59.306 --> 01:49:04.296
<v Ricky Horton>just check that off and load it selected.
Now the system knows you loaded it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/516-2
01:49:04.296 --> 01:49:07.943
<v Ricky Horton>It's not just a plan anymore,
you're loading it correct.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/516-3
01:49:07.943 --> 01:49:11.589
<v Ricky Horton>So let's see for instance.
So say you already got to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/516-4
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:13.700
<v Ricky Horton>So the day I go to load it is on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/517-0
01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:18.733
<v Ricky Horton>And I know all my quantities are there,
then I go through and select everything</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/517-1
01:49:18.733 --> 01:49:22.752
<v Ricky Horton>and then Chris, I load selected.
That's up. You guys need to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/517-2
01:49:22.752 --> 01:49:25.451
<v Ricky Horton>I I usually suggest that as a standing
loader,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/517-3
01:49:25.451 --> 01:49:29.757
<v Ricky Horton>like if you load 5 pieces of that and
then you come back later in the day,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/517-4
01:49:29.757 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Ricky Horton>you load another five.
I probably won't see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/518-0
01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:36.307
<v Ricky Horton>That as it's happening,
because I just know that most of the time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/518-1
01:49:36.307 --> 01:49:39.959
<v Ricky Horton>when I go someplace and it's like, OK,
I got everything loaded,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/518-2
01:49:39.959 --> 01:49:43.270
<v Ricky Horton>what people end up doing,
they end up saying, yeah, sure,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/518-3
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:47.607
<v Ricky Horton>everything's loaded and they do that and
everything and they're they're not</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/518-4
01:49:47.607 --> 01:49:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>checking it piece by piece or whatever,
you know?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/519-0
01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:55.280
<v Ricky Horton>And and then you just screwed up. Yeah.
So I think it was normally coming out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/519-1
01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.080
<v Ricky Horton>I'm checking there because it's coming
out one of these in my piece and then as</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/519-2
01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.860
<v Ricky Horton>you go to the abstract,
it's either get painted or rebuildings</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/519-3
01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:07.280
<v Ricky Horton>for its whole being.
As we heard this case may be, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/519-4
01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.620
<v Ricky Horton>but some basically do when it gets low.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/520-0
01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:15.963
<v Ricky Horton>To get shipped out. Yeah, it it it.
Are you building the load on the ground</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/520-1
01:50:15.963 --> 01:50:19.584
<v Ricky Horton>then it's then it's starting up on the
truck.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/520-2
01:50:19.584 --> 01:50:23.362
<v Ricky Horton>So some people that you guys have to sign
this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/520-3
01:50:23.362 --> 01:50:29.344
<v Ricky Horton>this that's the way we do the shop
housing that right there will be insured</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/520-4
01:50:29.344 --> 01:50:29.580
<v Ricky Horton>as.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/521-0
01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:34.632
<v Ricky Horton>The loaded as it was built on the ground,
their little truck gave you toothpicks</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/521-1
01:50:34.632 --> 01:50:38.249
<v Ricky Horton>were on the truck and and it's gone.
Then we get shipped.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/521-2
01:50:38.249 --> 01:50:41.741
<v Ricky Horton>So you guys got to even decide how you
want to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/521-3
01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:44.610
<v Ricky Horton>So everybody knows what does the loaded
mean?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/521-4
01:50:44.610 --> 01:50:49.100
<v Ricky Horton>Does it mean it's physically on the truck
or does that mean it's built?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/522-0
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:55.458
<v Ricky Horton>On the ground, yeah. So for us, our,
our definition shot I was in loaded was</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/522-1
01:50:55.458 --> 01:51:01.572
<v Ricky Horton>that loaded built on the ground.
I have a loaded all the gamer is ready to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/522-2
01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:05.812
<v Ricky Horton>get. So yeah,
that's probably the best way to do it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/522-3
01:51:05.812 --> 01:51:08.420
<v Ricky Horton>because then as you go, they're.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-0
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:13.466
<v Ricky Horton>And you're putting the rows of the rows.
You can go through that list and then you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-1
01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:17.072
<v Ricky Horton>have two of them between this row,
throw some more numbers down,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-2
01:51:17.072 --> 01:51:19.514
<v Ricky Horton>start on the next row,
those two are there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-3
01:51:19.514 --> 01:51:23.731
<v Ricky Horton>those two are there working down your
list as you're building your load and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-4
01:51:23.731 --> 01:51:27.560
<v Ricky Horton>then you have that marked off,
you know your quantities are good and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/523-5
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.780
<v Ricky Horton>then when you ship it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/524-0
01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:33.540
<v Ricky Horton>****, put it in the truck.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/525-0
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:48.485
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So it's the first time you do it.
I would recommend you walk through. OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/525-1
01:51:48.485 --> 01:51:53.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/526-0
01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:57.975
<v Ricky Horton>No, I'm always here to,
I'm always here to help with everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/526-1
01:51:57.975 --> 01:52:02.960
<v Ricky Horton>That's what what can be nice since you're
able to flip back and forth between</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/526-2
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.881
<v Ricky Horton>shipping stuff and receiving stuff.
Some people will do this still come down</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/526-3
01:52:07.881 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Ricky Horton>here and so like all the inventory that
the perceiving.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/527-0
01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:19.362
<v Ricky Horton>And if you hold down and say open in
either new window, let's see, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/527-1
01:52:19.362 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Ricky Horton>probably tab group.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/528-0
01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.660
<v Ricky Horton>It's just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/529-0
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:41.789
<v Ricky Horton>So you can do it this way and flip them
back and forth. Yeah, you just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/529-1
01:52:41.789 --> 01:52:43.820
<v Ricky Horton>I wanted it as enough.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/530-0
01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:53.530
<v Ricky Horton>What's the screen on my? That's my my.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/531-0
01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.817
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, exactly. Well,
that's so many of the things in your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/531-1
01:52:58.817 --> 01:53:04.317
<v Ricky Horton>gesture argument, David. I couldn't.
I couldn't put an exclamation point at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/531-2
01:53:04.317 --> 01:53:10.178
<v Ricky Horton>the end of my freaking password because
you click the button and swipe down Dale</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/531-3
01:53:10.178 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Ricky Horton>to add the toxic.
I got two different screens here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/532-0
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:18.313
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I interesting.
That way you don't have to get out of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/532-1
01:53:18.313 --> 01:53:21.938
<v Ricky Horton>shipping to go into receiving,
then get out of receiving.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/532-2
01:53:21.938 --> 01:53:26.375
<v Ricky Horton>When you go back in the shipping,
have one for one, one for the other.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/532-3
01:53:26.375 --> 01:53:29.500
<v Ricky Horton>We just went back and forth between the
two pads.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/533-0
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Ricky Horton>So I had hit a long hold on it and then I
hit.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/534-0
01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:56.267
<v Ricky Horton>That time track, the second one tabs.
Yeah. So you're not having trouble.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/534-1
01:53:56.267 --> 01:54:03.273
<v Ricky Horton>I I watch somebody just using it and it's
like you're not having trouble.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/534-2
01:54:03.273 --> 01:54:07.060
<v Ricky Horton>You're you're not scared to move around.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/535-0
01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:15.187
<v Ricky Horton>Other people are like steered touching
and then we want to touch, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/535-1
01:54:15.187 --> 01:54:20.380
<v Ricky Horton>you know, messed up.
Anything can be fixed. So yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/536-0
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.380
<v Ricky Horton>I was waiting on the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/537-0
01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:43.660
<v Ricky Horton>That's a that's a. Is that correct? Yeah.
No, it's the actual. I want to sit down.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/537-1
01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:47.820
<v Ricky Horton>I used to. I used to make.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/538-0
01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:52.930
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be able to you can to deal with the
relationship in the area you're going</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/538-1
01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:57.911
<v Ricky Horton>with. It's something I used to have.
There's like a little working with with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/538-2
01:54:57.911 --> 01:55:01.339
<v Ricky Horton>my other half.
They'll do all of that and then get a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/538-3
01:55:01.339 --> 01:55:03.020
<v Ricky Horton>little warming to show up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/539-0
01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:09.395
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to stay logged to your team
and still do you? Yeah, do it or yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/539-1
01:55:09.395 --> 01:55:14.308
<v Ricky Horton>you don't really need too much.
You can you can write it in the classroom.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/539-2
01:55:14.308 --> 01:55:18.893
<v Ricky Horton>The design you stay in modules.
Now you go in and you start marking a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/539-3
01:55:18.893 --> 01:55:23.740
<v Ricky Horton>bunch of **** out in production and then
we're gonna load all this stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/540-0
01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:28.276
<v Ricky Horton>I cannot do it. You get it. You get it.
You get it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/540-1
01:55:28.276 --> 01:55:33.161
<v Ricky Horton>Permission on the computer and everyone's
permission on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/540-2
01:55:33.161 --> 01:55:39.159
<v Ricky Horton>So the only thing I don't think I can
create profiles for VPM at all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/540-3
01:55:39.159 --> 01:55:43.700
<v Ricky Horton>It's user by user basis,
but I can copy VPM locally.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/541-0
01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:47.698
<v Ricky Horton>Commissions across users. So,
so how do I get this?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/541-1
01:55:47.698 --> 01:55:52.757
<v Ricky Horton>So is that there were anything from it?
There was a trimble in there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/541-2
01:55:52.757 --> 01:55:57.671
<v Ricky Horton>one of the tabs was trimbled,
so I just went in there and logged in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/541-3
01:55:57.671 --> 01:56:01.935
<v Ricky Horton>with my pass to go.
So but if you want to add it into your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/541-4
01:56:01.935 --> 01:56:03.380
<v Ricky Horton>bookmarks and stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/544-0
01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.070
<v Ricky Horton>On the Android guide,
so it should be here. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/544-1
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Ricky Horton>moving on Mark's territory with that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/545-0
01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:23.420
<v Ricky Horton>Too much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/547-0
01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>Wow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/548-0
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.780
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be right for watching that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/549-0
01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:51.460

<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I guess is there a share button? Yeah,

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/551-0
01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:27.236
<v Ricky Horton>And if you want to retrieve it and go see
if it's I I don't like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/551-1
01:57:27.236 --> 01:57:30.860

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/552-0
01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:36.860
<v Ricky Horton>They basically buy it for 100 for 100
bucks. Yeah, for 100 bucks and uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/553-0
01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.561
<v Ricky Horton>They said, oh, we can't secure that.
You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/553-1
01:57:41.561 --> 01:57:45.877
<v Ricky Horton>we had everything like out security app
and all that stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/553-2
01:57:45.877 --> 01:57:51.200
<v Ricky Horton>They bought 350 tablets last month.
They put it on the social media. Wow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/553-3
01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:54.869
<v Ricky Horton>I was like,
why are you grabbing about that stupid</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/553-4
01:57:54.869 --> 01:57:55.300
<v Ricky Horton>thing?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/555-0
01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:58.780
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe, by the way,
this was for you at some point.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/555-1
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:03.249
<v Ricky Horton>You're gonna accidentally get that yellow
pad and see it change the view.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/555-2
01:58:03.249 --> 01:58:07.416
<v Ricky Horton>This is like an old view of the Android
screen. It sucks. It's that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/555-3
01:58:07.416 --> 01:58:10.798
<v Ricky Horton>Just get that.
I think that if we get screwed up. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/555-4
01:58:10.798 --> 01:58:11.100
<v Ricky Horton>cool.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/556-0
01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:20.528
<v Ricky Horton>No, they won't move. So. But yeah,
somebody will get that. And the old view,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/556-1
01:58:20.528 --> 01:58:28.956
<v Ricky Horton>the old way the inventory was there.
So we can have this display in Spanish,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/556-2
01:58:28.956 --> 01:58:32.020
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yeah, sure can. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/557-0
01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:37.240
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that should be good.
We want you to work on the long use</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/557-1
01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:37.820
<v Ricky Horton>screen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/560-0
01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:53.639
<v Ricky Horton>Anything on Gavin to walk through you?
Yeah, on everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/560-1
01:58:53.639 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Ricky Horton>There's something like back and forth
communication.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/561-0
01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:07.300
<v Ricky Horton>I probably can build on you in this,
I'll be in it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/563-0
01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:31.859
<v Ricky Horton>But we'll try to,
I don't think it's going to happen. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/563-1
01:59:31.859 --> 01:59:38.394
<v Ricky Horton>when I saw it, I'm not going to. Yeah,
because the kids,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/563-2
01:59:38.394 --> 01:59:42.980
<v Ricky Horton>we're not really sure you all over time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/564-0
01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Ricky Horton>It's what I need.
We'll kind of connect you basically then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/564-1
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.655
<v Ricky Horton>we should be accessible.
Now the next time you should run through,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/564-2
01:59:53.655 --> 01:59:57.546
<v Ricky Horton>you can go over the process flow.
This is what came in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/564-3
01:59:57.546 --> 02:00:01.020
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna put up with mentioning you get
them on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/565-0
02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:08.531
<v Ricky Horton>Tell him to **** himself when we're going
through this map,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/565-1
02:00:08.531 --> 02:00:17.300
<v Ricky Horton>so we'll go through it and get it down to
OT and keep that process going.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/566-0
02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:25.171
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm going to make us more efficient.
So we're going to need you to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/566-1
02:00:25.171 --> 02:00:31.742
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I don't want to work in the bank.
What's recent? What do you do?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/566-2
02:00:31.742 --> 02:00:33.500
<v Ricky Horton>You're all set. So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/567-0
02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:43.157
<v Ricky Horton>We can go over and see if he has any
questions, but I think you're involved.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/567-1
02:00:43.157 --> 02:00:47.900
<v Ricky Horton>So thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/568-0
02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:55.860
<v Ricky Horton>First thing in the process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/569-0
02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Ricky Horton>Alright, so I didn't.
So my guys go to production tracking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/570-0
02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:20.180
<v Ricky Horton>So we're going to put in here,
but there's time to do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/570-1
02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:28.820
<v Ricky Horton>So you're spring one up in there,
moving with one front and then match.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/571-0
02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:33.067
<v Ricky Horton>And then from there they would get start
and stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/571-1
02:01:33.067 --> 02:01:38.726
<v Ricky Horton>So so that how will that start and stop
will be this entire from B1 all the way</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/571-2
02:01:38.726 --> 02:01:42.969
<v Ricky Horton>to C3, correct? Yep.
So I want to separate those out saying</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/571-3
02:01:42.969 --> 02:01:45.020
<v Ricky Horton>they'll they only have B1 BG.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/572-0
02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:49.827
<v Ricky Horton>So if they only have B1B2B3,
then just select B1B2330. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/572-1
02:01:49.827 --> 02:01:54.975
<v Ricky Horton>that's something that you can do.
Your start stop is already reply</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/572-2
02:01:54.975 --> 02:01:57.740
<v Ricky Horton>whichever feature you have selected.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/573-0
02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Ricky Horton>Which actually we go batch time and then
should be here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/574-0
02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:15.500
<v Ricky Horton>Is this is for individual to be added in
our minutes individually?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/575-0
02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:21.180
<v Ricky Horton>You want to if you want to just so if you
needed um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/576-0
02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:27.907
<v Ricky Horton>Just start there, right?
And then if you wanted, I get this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/576-1
02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:33.383
<v Ricky Horton>you can say one there, right? Whoops,
I have two. It's all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/576-2
02:02:33.383 --> 02:02:37.580
<v Ricky Horton>And then we'll get down.
We'll do B2 as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/577-0
02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:42.921
<v Ricky Horton>And just there there shouldn't be all
there's some work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/577-1
02:02:42.921 --> 02:02:45.500
<v Ricky Horton>It'd be easier for that, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/578-0
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:48.060
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/579-0
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.595
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and then if you go back up to the top,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/579-1
02:02:57.595 --> 02:03:04.158
<v Ricky Horton>whenever you're done in your spot,
when when you get an update,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/579-2
02:03:04.158 --> 02:03:08.260
<v Ricky Horton>that time will apply to this free piece.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/580-0
02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:14.785
<v Ricky Horton>It's kind of cool. We used to it on,
but I I've just that you move your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/580-1
02:03:14.785 --> 02:03:20.701
<v Ricky Horton>patterns up and then I'll have you.
So and so I'll update that. Sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/580-2
02:03:20.701 --> 02:03:25.180
<v Ricky Horton>So I think your time you're working on
those pieces.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/583-0
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:37.915
<v Ricky Horton>You know, and a lot of times,
like as we're sending out shop releases,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/583-1
02:03:37.915 --> 02:03:45.369
<v Ricky Horton>there's usually one word package or maybe
two word packages that's up and that'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/583-2
02:03:45.369 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Ricky Horton>be priority.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/584-0
02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:51.695
<v Ricky Horton>So in a lot of times the the that we do
for the yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/584-1
02:03:51.695 --> 02:03:56.833
<v Ricky Horton>we'll have a job number and all the
durations work out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/584-2
02:03:56.833 --> 02:04:03.898
<v Ricky Horton>So packages probably be your best.
So it's only that one's nice doesn't have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/584-3
02:04:03.898 --> 02:04:04.540
<v Ricky Horton>a huge.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/585-0
02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:11.009
<v Ricky Horton>Once we're starting the shelf job,
we're going to have over 100 and they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/585-1
02:04:11.009 --> 02:04:17.687
<v Ricky Horton>planning running on the additional shelf
packages for TSM three through that most</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/585-2
02:04:17.687 --> 02:04:20.700
<v Ricky Horton>of those will be coded only imported.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/586-0
02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:26.814
<v Ricky Horton>But for the stuff that's coming out of
production,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/586-1
02:04:26.814 --> 02:04:35.276
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to have a work package.
You look back at you guys in my order is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/586-2
02:04:35.276 --> 02:04:38.660
<v Ricky Horton>that in this one is only fine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/587-0
02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.936
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I wanted to take a look at that because I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/587-1
02:04:42.936 --> 02:04:48.448
<v Ricky Horton>see that when you're looking down,
I got to mess up the browse and make sure</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/587-2
02:04:48.448 --> 02:04:51.740
<v Ricky Horton>the riding is going to use the one of the
or.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/588-0
02:04:55.220 --> 02:05:01.037
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe not when we started working on it,
but I think that that would be there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/588-1
02:05:01.037 --> 02:05:06.332
<v Ricky Horton>since those aren't tied to setting up the
station or deleting a thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/588-2
02:05:06.332 --> 02:05:12.298
<v Ricky Horton>It's just a piece tracking side and add
it to take it away at any time and it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/588-3
02:05:12.298 --> 02:05:14.460
<v Ricky Horton>not going to affect anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/589-0
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:19.926
<v Ricky Horton>Don't have a cut saw in there and cutless
is cut and then cut saw.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/589-1
02:05:19.926 --> 02:05:26.149
<v Ricky Horton>That's going to make things better than I
have to working on the East traffic</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/589-2
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:29.180
<v Ricky Horton>stations. Oh, sorry, yeah, that's the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/590-0
02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:39.232
<v Ricky Horton>They don't want to be needed,
unless they want to see just how there's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/590-1
02:05:39.232 --> 02:05:48.709
<v Ricky Horton>things you do in that's private.
Everything we do that we've been doing so</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/590-2
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:49.340
<v Ricky Horton>much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/591-0
02:05:50.180 --> 02:06:00.881
<v Ricky Horton>I'll go look at that because right now
I'm pretty sure all EPM users have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/591-1
02:06:00.881 --> 02:06:08.300
<v Ricky Horton>I've been finding profiles for Powerfab.
Yeah, EPM.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/594-0
02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:38.740
<v Ricky Horton>It's pretty cut and dry as we started
getting this roll out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/595-0
02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:45.980
<v Ricky Horton>I almost got the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/596-0
02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:00.708
<v Ricky Horton>Start, stop.
We go through the process of this is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/596-1
02:07:00.708 --> 02:07:05.584
<v Ricky Horton>Once you guys are done,
give me a call or run out there and we'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/596-2
02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:09.277
<v Ricky Horton>mark the maps completed.
We do that two to three,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/596-3
02:07:09.277 --> 02:07:13.340
<v Ricky Horton>five times depending on the guy will be
second nature.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/597-0
02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:17.058
<v Ricky Horton>So and then we'll all be. So,
rock and roll.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/597-1
02:07:17.058 --> 02:07:22.864
<v Ricky Horton>I appreciate you taking the time out of
Dana. So if you have any questions,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/597-2
02:07:22.864 --> 02:07:28.288
<v Ricky Horton>we can come this call and then once we
get into the overall situation,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/597-3
02:07:28.288 --> 02:07:30.580
<v Ricky Horton>maybe Paul will go through it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/598-0
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:35.380
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/599-0
02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/600-0
02:07:55.300 --> 02:08:03.752
<v Ricky Horton>Those guys are required in general at all.
Yeah, and they should.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/600-1
02:08:03.752 --> 02:08:13.740
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be surprised that they'll call me
the first time. I'll be second nature.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/601-0
02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:20.744
<v Ricky Horton>That that seemed kind of eager to want it
and do it. So it's just good. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/601-1
02:08:20.744 --> 02:08:27.048
<v Ricky Horton>and and I've shown it to them a few times
in the capabilities, you know, it'll be,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/601-2
02:08:27.048 --> 02:08:30.238
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
and they just haven't had the tools</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/601-3
02:08:30.238 --> 02:08:32.820
<v Ricky Horton>available. Yeah, I'll follow them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/602-0
02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:37.763
<v Ricky Horton>I know that would be a challenge,
but considering some with the need out</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/602-1
02:08:37.763 --> 02:08:40.961
<v Ricky Horton>there,
but we're going to do on the board list,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/602-2
02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:44.025
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to do salt scooters or ice
packs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/602-3
02:08:44.025 --> 02:08:48.822
<v Ricky Horton>We have three waters everywhere and then
like I was saying in the shop,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/602-4
02:08:48.822 --> 02:08:50.420
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to buy that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/604-0
02:08:53.980 --> 02:09:08.780
<v Ricky Horton>Beverage and just modifying the paperwork.
Yeah, yeah, so they take one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/605-0
02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:17.729
<v Ricky Horton>I'll make sure Kristin, Mark,
that's the new conscious integration.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/605-1
02:09:17.729 --> 02:09:26.709
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm waiting for this time to add the
additional modules that we don't have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/605-2
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:27.860
<v Ricky Horton>currently.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/606-0
02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:34.033
<v Ricky Horton>I asked if he did not have the comment on
the cutting against cutting, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/606-1
02:09:34.033 --> 02:09:38.300
<v Ricky Horton>another CLC array,
a few different things in there, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/607-0
02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:45.272
<v Ricky Horton>Once he adds those modules to my quote,
then we can get that push through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/607-1
02:09:45.272 --> 02:09:50.086
<v Ricky Horton>It's a credit card order,
which one it says the original quote</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/607-2
02:09:50.086 --> 02:09:54.060
<v Ricky Horton>without the additional log rules is about
50 grand.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/608-0
02:09:55.780 --> 02:10:02.725
<v Ricky Horton>So we're gonna add, we'll have that much.
How big is your? What's yours? Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/608-1
02:10:02.725 --> 02:10:08.527
<v Ricky Horton>100K units of 35K, right?
You can call the number on the back and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/608-2
02:10:08.527 --> 02:10:11.340
<v Ricky Horton>use the falls address. ****. OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/609-0
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Ricky Horton>And uh, you can teach up your,
your balance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/610-0
02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:24.201
<v Ricky Horton>OK. I know it was like 35,000, yeah.
So you can, we can figure that out too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/610-1
02:10:24.201 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Ricky Horton>We can just, we have to install,
have all my phone read and off. OK, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/611-0
02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.733
<v Ricky Horton>But it's going to be like,
I think more for 20. No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/611-1
02:10:35.733 --> 02:10:38.939
<v Ricky Horton>my guess is probably 17 would be 18 as
well 14,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/611-2
02:10:38.939 --> 02:10:44.349
<v Ricky Horton>but that's also was more than stating our
maintenance plan with them because our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/611-3
02:10:44.349 --> 02:10:46.820
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance plan has been down since.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/612-0
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:52.661
<v Ricky Horton>First to be here,
so I'm so we're going to be put the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/612-1
02:10:52.661 --> 02:10:59.260
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance plan on there so that we have
steady support. We don't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/613-0
02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:05.129
<v Ricky Horton>What's he got?
So we're not loading up the scope for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/613-1
02:11:05.129 --> 02:11:11.157
<v Ricky Horton>like ITR level code as well or so we're
plugging and building some projects.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/613-2
02:11:11.157 --> 02:11:14.602
<v Ricky Horton>So she says just for now she'll so OK,
Yep,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/613-3
02:11:14.602 --> 02:11:19.220
<v Ricky Horton>we'll do a roll out on that and it will
be the same thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/614-0
02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:32.940
<v Ricky Horton>You just call us there. Yep. Yeah,
reporting. Yeah, I mean, computer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/615-0
02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:41.740
<v Ricky Horton>Two things I mean,
at least about 4 minutes or something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/616-0
02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:53.700
<v Ricky Horton>So I would hear you, but it's very much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/617-0
02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:02.356
<v Ricky Horton>And then since like the audience is oh,
it's the only emails when we need to like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/617-1
02:12:02.356 --> 02:12:07.850
<v Ricky Horton>Jarrod's inbox and in the chat it is.
And then you and me. It just gets lost.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/617-2
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:12.006
<v Ricky Horton>You and me. You and me.
And I don't like to do about this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/617-3
02:12:12.006 --> 02:12:16.020
<v Ricky Horton>So what I do is I send an e-mail and I'll
call next day.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/618-0
02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:17.220
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/619-0
02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:26.180
<v Ricky Horton>But that's the only thing that's a little
bit more usable.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/620-0
02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:34.721
<v Ricky Horton>So as far as what's the process going to
be,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/620-1
02:12:34.721 --> 02:12:44.780
<v Ricky Horton>are you going to re get the loads for
them or what's the so?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/621-0
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:50.864
<v Ricky Horton>Most of them we do,
because a lot of our projects are kind of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/621-1
02:12:50.864 --> 02:12:54.908
<v Ricky Horton>a bit smaller. Yeah, there's OK one,
maybe 10 loads. Yep. No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/621-2
02:12:54.908 --> 02:12:59.017
<v Ricky Horton>you're not really looking for that
assemblies are really good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/621-3
02:12:59.017 --> 02:13:04.300
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's probably that time shopping
there. I do obviously get the drawings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/622-0
02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:09.777
<v Ricky Horton>And go and adjust it.
You want to be independent on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/622-1
02:13:09.777 --> 02:13:15.649
<v Ricky Horton>So most of them say you know I have to
talk to them and then, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/622-2
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:22.645
<v Ricky Horton>they're getting like smart sheets or all
their stuff because they have plenty of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/622-3
02:13:22.645 --> 02:13:23.940
<v Ricky Horton>field programs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/623-0
02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:38.692
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know who's still getting used to
that. Yeah, I work at it. So it's kind of,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/623-1
02:13:38.692 --> 02:13:40.900
<v Ricky Horton>it's kind of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/624-0
02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:44.991
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what I've just done. Yeah.
Yeah. So I think,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/624-1
02:13:44.991 --> 02:13:48.111
<v Ricky Horton>so there's that's something like 3
minutes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/624-2
02:13:48.111 --> 02:13:51.799
<v Ricky Horton>So you just walk across the calendars all
the time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/624-3
02:13:51.799 --> 02:13:57.613
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I'll go up there early next week.
So we can we can just reschedule it and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/624-4
02:13:57.613 --> 02:13:58.180
<v Ricky Horton>it's OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/625-0
02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Ricky Horton>All right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/626-0
02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:08.134
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So, so with the process integration,
I'm hoping to get that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/626-1
02:14:08.134 --> 02:14:14.321
<v Ricky Horton>that updates today and I'm going to not
submission as as I did for training today.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/626-2
02:14:14.321 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Ricky Horton>So we can kind of listen to what that
process entails.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/627-0
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:24.792
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm guessing a brand new member of IT
because it's gotta be something that's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/627-1
02:14:24.792 --> 02:14:30.845
<v Ricky Horton>attached to the server because I know our
pronis is currently posted on our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/627-2
02:14:30.845 --> 02:14:35.703
<v Ricky Horton>domestic computer. Yeah,
and so that'll the placement in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/627-3
02:14:35.703 --> 02:14:36.340
<v Ricky Horton>process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/628-0
02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:42.839
<v Ricky Horton>The nice part is that I'm pretty sure
even the plug in if you want the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/628-1
02:14:42.839 --> 02:14:47.563
<v Ricky Horton>integrations,
you activate Cronus integration and just</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/628-2
02:14:47.563 --> 02:14:52.287
<v Ricky Horton>link it too.
They should set that up for you hopefully</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/628-3
02:14:52.287 --> 02:14:53.060
<v Ricky Horton>cause it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/629-0
02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:56.604
<v Ricky Horton>The product integration is a little bit
complex.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/629-1
02:14:56.604 --> 02:15:00.508
<v Ricky Horton>It's got a there's a lot of segments you
got to set up in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/629-2
02:15:00.508 --> 02:15:05.253
<v Ricky Horton>Some of the integrations in there you
just say turn on and they just there's a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/629-3
02:15:05.253 --> 02:15:08.977
<v Ricky Horton>little bit complex,
but like go into go back into the desktop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/629-4
02:15:08.977 --> 02:15:11.980
<v Ricky Horton>version and go into a production control
job and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/630-0
02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:15.922
<v Ricky Horton>Like go like you're going to go nest some
plate here. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/630-1
02:15:15.922 --> 02:15:20.923
<v Ricky Horton>and then you'll click nest with Pro Nest
and then it'll generate a file and just</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/630-2
02:15:20.923 --> 02:15:25.184
<v Ricky Horton>keep that into my program. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. So when you do that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/630-3
02:15:25.184 --> 02:15:28.580
<v Ricky Horton>you choose Pro Nest integration on that
optimizations.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/631-0
02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:32.559
<v Ricky Horton>And it spits out the file,
it gets into progress,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/631-1
02:15:32.559 --> 02:15:35.660
<v Ricky Horton>and then it it does everything from there
pretty much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/632-0
02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:46.700
<v Ricky Horton>Your plate inventory will then be
controlled by Prodisk, which is nice too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/633-0
02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:54.775
<v Ricky Horton>You you'd have to do it before there's
like the nesting stage,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/633-1
02:15:54.775 --> 02:15:57.900
<v Ricky Horton>so you want to get combined is where you
want to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/634-0
02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:02.380
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/635-0
02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:12.625
<v Ricky Horton>Optimizations and out out there and plate
nesting settings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/635-1
02:16:12.625 --> 02:16:18.546
<v Ricky Horton>So there where it says take the power
fabs you would have. Yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/635-2
02:16:18.546 --> 02:16:23.551
<v Ricky Horton>it used to be still projects and now it's
the same way. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/635-3
02:16:23.551 --> 02:16:27.220
<v Ricky Horton>now it's when we have our 5 second
machine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/636-0
02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:35.769
<v Ricky Horton>Projects program.
It gives land tech provides. Yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/636-1
02:16:35.769 --> 02:16:45.448
<v Ricky Horton>I love the machine.
And steel projects has equally the same</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/636-2
02:16:45.448 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Ricky Horton>terrible.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/637-0
02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:51.002
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and we always had the trouble with bicep</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/637-1
02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:55.452
<v Ricky Horton>bone was different.
It's your projects point bicep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/637-2
02:16:55.452 --> 02:16:59.389
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care. OK,
you got to figure that out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/637-3
02:16:59.389 --> 02:17:04.780
<v Ricky Horton>If somebody takes somebody, make this.
Yeah, frustrated on me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/638-0
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:15.934
<v Ricky Horton>That that would be nice to be done and
and then we'll see them a scale of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/638-1
02:17:15.934 --> 02:17:22.060
<v Ricky Horton>excellence.
I know we don't know each other.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/639-0
02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:29.930
<v Ricky Horton>And I'll meet you mine.
We need to reply to the shots and have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/639-1
02:17:29.930 --> 02:17:36.024
<v Ricky Horton>that view the snooze, the promise,
play modules also,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/639-2
02:17:36.024 --> 02:17:39.860
<v Ricky Horton>that we can start pulling in that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/640-0
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:46.839
<v Ricky Horton>OK. And now with the added modules,
we'll be able to nest a little bit more</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/640-1
02:17:46.839 --> 02:17:51.065
<v Ricky Horton>efficiently.
So without that common ground cut and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/640-2
02:17:51.065 --> 02:17:55.540
<v Ricky Horton>without the horses cut,
this company has ever missed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/641-0
02:17:55.580 --> 02:18:01.880
<v Ricky Horton>You got this much space in the apartment.
It's like a square. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/641-1
02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:07.629
<v Ricky Horton>I can't these run on a common line,
but I want to go one time and myself</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/641-2
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:10.700
<v Ricky Horton>prepare from both ends. Yeah, yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/642-0
02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:15.581
<v Ricky Horton>But not bad. So yeah, get that.
I'm trying to get that to the day.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/642-1
02:18:15.581 --> 02:18:21.026
<v Ricky Horton>So we just we know that updated code,
we'll get that order and hopefully we can</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/642-2
02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:26.608
<v Ricky Horton>get that that interface pushed through
for tomorrow. Yeah. And then we can do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/642-3
02:18:26.608 --> 02:18:27.220
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/643-0
02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>I'm good. It's always. Yeah, I'm going to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/645-0
02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:41.748
<v Ricky Horton>That's saying Alan is to verify too
because I'm going to take one is 35K in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/645-1
02:18:41.748 --> 02:18:42.220
<v Ricky Horton>London.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/646-0
02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:47.282
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
Joe had like 100K and now he's doing like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/646-1
02:18:47.282 --> 02:18:51.636
<v Ricky Horton>75K. Oh wow, something like that.
And I don't even get it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/646-2
02:18:51.636 --> 02:18:56.284
<v Ricky Horton>But we have to max their **** out every
month, physically say,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/646-3
02:18:56.284 --> 02:19:02.040
<v Ricky Horton>and where they're buying ticket trucks
and credit companies can walk into the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/646-4
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.220
<v Ricky Horton>Ford dealership.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/647-0
02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:11.934
<v Ricky Horton>I should put it on last night.
Did he get the updated price for the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/647-1
02:19:11.934 --> 02:19:15.220
<v Ricky Horton>bottles? I don't think so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/648-0
02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:23.520
<v Ricky Horton>That was a good bridge though. Yeah,
it's like I'm hanging.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/648-1
02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:25.940
<v Ricky Horton>I'm putting a lot on ready.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/649-0
02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:37.500
<v Ricky Horton>You.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/650-0
02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:46.272
<v Ricky Horton>But you'll see that a lot of reports,
the last spreadsheets and how it is about</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/650-1
02:19:46.272 --> 02:19:47.060
<v Ricky Horton>that reflect.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/651-0
02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:56.277
<v Ricky Horton>And does Nina appear to be working with
it for your faith back,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/651-1
02:19:56.277 --> 02:20:02.740
<v Ricky Horton>but between my money. Yeah,
this is a community project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/654-0
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:25.887
<v Ricky Horton>You just have fun, dude. Yeah,
I respond to being directly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/654-1
02:20:25.887 --> 02:20:30.120
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I just wanted to,
since you have that question. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/654-2
02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:33.376
<v Ricky Horton>it will be.
It's right now in the Christmas gifts</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/654-3
02:20:33.376 --> 02:20:35.980
<v Ricky Horton>when we talk, it feels the next student.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/655-0
02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:42.168
<v Ricky Horton>All right.
So through this plate integration</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/655-1
02:20:42.168 --> 02:20:46.910
<v Ricky Horton>discussion,
not really too much that can be done.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/655-2
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:52.980
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have to go to one discussion if we
get not really able to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/657-0
02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:07.532
<v Ricky Horton>He's like, Jeff. Oh, Chuck.
If they just see. So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/657-1
02:21:07.532 --> 02:21:14.860
<v Ricky Horton>I guess we'll be like, yeah,
we thought I was. Oh, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/658-0
02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:21.881
<v Ricky Horton>So I would like to see the electrical
verifies. Yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/658-1
02:21:21.881 --> 02:21:27.126
<v Ricky Horton>right around there's not too much.
We can just talk to here and take a look</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/658-2
02:21:27.126 --> 02:21:31.335
<v Ricky Horton>at our files and see what we can hear
about the codings. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/658-3
02:21:31.335 --> 02:21:33.060
<v Ricky Horton>that's like white coding.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/659-0
02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:42.701
<v Ricky Horton>How are your use of the work packages?
Are they close to that or do you have any</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/659-1
02:21:42.701 --> 02:21:47.903
<v Ricky Horton>questions?
There's a couple in there that are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/659-2
02:21:47.903 --> 02:21:49.260
<v Ricky Horton>closing out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/660-0
02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:55.180
<v Ricky Horton>Bug condition. Uh, you can see him.
You can see him in there. Um, it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/661-0
02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:02.660
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/662-0
02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:05.140
<v Ricky Horton>Right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/663-0
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:18.922
<v Ricky Horton>They won't be weak. I think it's coming.
I'm not closing up or go back up to your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/663-1
02:22:18.922 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Ricky Horton>filter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/664-0
02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/665-0
02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:30.020
<v Ricky Horton>There should be, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/666-0
02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:39.180
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you just built it for a while.
Let's complete it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/666-1
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:45.019
<v Ricky Horton>Go back into the desktop and see some of
that. Do the maintenance,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/666-2
02:22:45.019 --> 02:22:51.903
<v Ricky Horton>production control and work packages.
I have. I have still goes in. Some jobs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/666-3
02:22:51.903 --> 02:22:53.820
<v Ricky Horton>Absolutely other jobs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/667-0
02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:59.410
<v Ricky Horton>Basically,
obviously all the work I can use.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/667-1
02:22:59.410 --> 02:23:05.084
<v Ricky Horton>So depository, yeah,
completed required here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/667-2
02:23:05.084 --> 02:23:08.660
<v Ricky Horton>start dropping on the button.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/668-0
02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:17.980
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what that the CPU is,
but it will be back. I know it's going to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/669-0
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:31.300
<v Ricky Horton>It's still bugging me that they move that
everything I have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/670-0
02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:40.820
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/671-0
02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.500
<v Ricky Horton>See the Dashboard Productivity station.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/672-0
02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:52.300
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the little arrow.
I don't know if I talked about this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/673-0
02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:57.460
<v Ricky Horton>So, all right,
so you got to say I hit the drop down.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/674-0
02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:06.419
<v Ricky Horton>So you can. So this is whether it should,
whether it's complete. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/674-1
02:24:06.419 --> 02:24:12.862
<v Ricky Horton>So right now you got to say if the last
station is completed and you can key on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/674-2
02:24:12.862 --> 02:24:17.936
<v Ricky Horton>whatever, whichever.
So that's why it's it's going on the last</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/674-3
02:24:17.936 --> 02:24:18.580
<v Ricky Horton>station.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/675-0
02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:20.420
<v Ricky Horton>OK, now that will.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/676-0
02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:26.176
<v Ricky Horton>With the with including paint that'll
include. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/676-1
02:24:26.176 --> 02:24:31.047
<v Ricky Horton>so the last thing is done and they will
forgive it. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/676-2
02:24:31.047 --> 02:24:34.700
<v Ricky Horton>I was just curious how that's going about.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/677-0
02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:43.162
<v Ricky Horton>So you would probably want to make sure
all the new ones that that we need are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/677-1
02:24:43.162 --> 02:24:47.566
<v Ricky Horton>the same one that you know. Yeah,
and some of those probably are affected</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/677-2
02:24:47.566 --> 02:24:51.256
<v Ricky Horton>with the changes we've made in the route
because nonetheless,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/677-3
02:24:51.256 --> 02:24:53.220
<v Ricky Horton>I guess it shouldn't be that way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/678-0
02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:56.797
<v Ricky Horton>If they were completed and then we
adjusted the routes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/678-1
02:24:56.797 --> 02:25:01.220
<v Ricky Horton>so now that the last there's an added
last route, would that reopen it then?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/679-0
02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:09.006
<v Ricky Horton>So at the beginning, yes.
So that's probably why we added it to a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/679-1
02:25:09.006 --> 02:25:14.472
<v Ricky Horton>typical production. You know,
every single one of the packages went</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/679-2
02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:19.455
<v Ricky Horton>down and not completed anymore.
So you're mainly closing the,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/679-3
02:25:19.455 --> 02:25:20.500
<v Ricky Horton>you're right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/680-0
02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:24.865
<v Ricky Horton>Cause yeah,
that would be the that would be the kick</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/680-1
02:25:24.865 --> 02:25:29.659
<v Ricky Horton>for that announcement.
So in some of these obviously they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/680-2
02:25:29.659 --> 02:25:36.260
<v Ricky Horton>great to leave cause for a while they're
20/20/21 when we were pretty green on the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/681-0
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:56.020
<v Ricky Horton>On the mounting and everything,
we were making her up for a job. I'm like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/682-0
02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:03.265
<v Ricky Horton>This is we're trying to figure out along
the way if you made all this junk and we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/682-1
02:26:03.265 --> 02:26:07.796
<v Ricky Horton>don't want clean it up.
It's like at least with this one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/682-2
02:26:07.796 --> 02:26:13.185
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think if I wanted to delete the
straw that was on a project,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/682-3
02:26:13.185 --> 02:26:16.700
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to take a while off of that
item.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/683-0
02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:22.695
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what each project we had there.
Yes, for sure. So yeah, a little,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/683-1
02:26:22.695 --> 02:26:27.228
<v Ricky Horton>a little less of a struggle than some of
the energy areas.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/683-2
02:26:27.228 --> 02:26:30.300
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm worried about that, but for sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-0
02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:34.159
<v Ricky Horton>This one,
this will be do use on a couple of ones</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-1
02:26:34.159 --> 02:26:37.738
<v Ricky Horton>which I could probably just change into a
complex route.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-2
02:26:37.738 --> 02:26:41.253
<v Ricky Horton>The only difference with this is it has a
a fit up one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-3
02:26:41.253 --> 02:26:44.079
<v Ricky Horton>a fit up to a well one and a well type
here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-4
02:26:44.079 --> 02:26:49.289
<v Ricky Horton>So we had seconds first and second stage
moment on that complex problems for that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/684-5
02:26:49.289 --> 02:26:49.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/685-0
02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:55.060
<v Ricky Horton>This one I can probably just switch to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/689-0
02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:26.099
<v Ricky Horton>He's gonna be help business counselor.
Yeah, actually following the same thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/689-1
02:27:26.099 --> 02:27:31.473
<v Ricky Horton>That's one of the business part.
Jacob still. Oh, Jacob. Jacob.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/689-2
02:27:31.473 --> 02:27:34.580
<v Ricky Horton>It's right behind me. Jacob was like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/690-0
02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:44.460
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, for some reason it's not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/691-0
02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:46.340
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/692-0
02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.140
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, did you try that? Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/693-0
02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:58.782
<v Ricky Horton>A little program to finalize all the
stuff. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/693-1
02:27:58.782 --> 02:28:03.127
<v Ricky Horton>it did not open up my computer.
It wasn't going to be there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/693-2
02:28:03.127 --> 02:28:08.826
<v Ricky Horton>but I I e-mailed a guy like I said the
the not the researcher sent me an e-mail</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/693-3
02:28:08.826 --> 02:28:10.820
<v Ricky Horton>last night that said here's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/694-0
02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:16.739
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't looked at it.
I don't know what solution we did either.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/694-1
02:28:16.739 --> 02:28:21.460
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it didn't work. He he said it.
I think it was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/696-0
02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:30.243
<v Ricky Horton>84 million years or so that even to be
done. It took 10 hours for it to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/696-1
02:28:30.243 --> 02:28:37.140
<v Ricky Horton>They said on a regular computer,
it took about 6 seconds per per.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/697-0
02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:38.660
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/698-0
02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:45.420
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's true.
We cannot make this necessarily.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/699-0
02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.220
<v Ricky Horton>I thought that that was different.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/700-0
02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:57.076
<v Ricky Horton>Hopefully that's only in one.
That's the easy fix.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/700-1
02:28:57.076 --> 02:29:05.180
<v Ricky Horton>This one's on the other one,
so I'm going to be going again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/701-0
02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:06.940
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/702-0
02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:09.540
<v Ricky Horton>All I have is e-mail.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/703-0
02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:13.460
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/704-0
02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:16.340
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/706-0
02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:31.620
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/708-0
02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:44.820
<v Ricky Horton>Goodbye.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/709-0
02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:51.300
<v Ricky Horton>Straight to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/712-0
02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:15.620
<v Ricky Horton>Here are the objects.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/713-0
02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:20.660
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/714-0
02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:32.180
<v Ricky Horton>You were asking me about.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/715-0
02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:37.622
<v Ricky Horton>You were asking about the wheels coming
in, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/715-1
02:30:37.622 --> 02:30:40.907
<v Ricky Horton>Is that you and I talked about that
yesterday? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/715-2
02:30:40.907 --> 02:30:45.990
<v Ricky Horton>for like the the base hour probably in
the project sticking or oh, the kiss file.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/715-3
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:50.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, how it's coming in. Yep, Yep, Yep.
And being able to toggle that off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/716-0
02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:55.069
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I just thought so.
I had fixed that in in a specific way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/716-1
02:30:55.069 --> 02:30:59.848
<v Ricky Horton>There's no way to turn it off,
but you can set it so that when it comes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/716-2
02:30:59.848 --> 02:31:04.561
<v Ricky Horton>in, it gives you no time. OK,
you want that? You want to look at that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/716-3
02:31:04.561 --> 02:31:06.220
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, let's check it out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/717-0
02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:10.745
<v Ricky Horton>I listen the day in my existence on
customers. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/717-1
02:31:10.745 --> 02:31:16.425
<v Ricky Horton>I did this but I'm one thing with a
client. If you go up to maintenance,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/717-2
02:31:16.425 --> 02:31:19.460
<v Ricky Horton>estimating labor, maintenance and Weld.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/718-0
02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:25.300
<v Ricky Horton>And then go to like um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/719-0
02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:30.042
<v Ricky Horton>Fill it well, manual,
well go to the drop down to top well</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/719-1
02:31:30.042 --> 02:31:33.540
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance drop down and then well type
maintenance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/720-0
02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:37.620
<v Ricky Horton>And now it will feel well manual.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/721-0
02:31:39.860 --> 02:31:43.794
<v Ricky Horton>Number six there,
you see the well pipe mapping down there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/721-1
02:31:43.794 --> 02:31:47.460
<v Ricky Horton>in the bottom right hand corner when
you're importing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/722-0
02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:55.050
<v Ricky Horton>That is the nomenclature for the specific
types of the welds within what the what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/722-1
02:31:55.050 --> 02:32:00.991
<v Ricky Horton>you're reporting and and so it says cool
if I see Andrew Weld as an example, cool,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/722-2
02:32:00.991 --> 02:32:06.860
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to make that feel well manual
so that it changes it feel well manual.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/723-0
02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:13.682
<v Ricky Horton>So what I've done is I'll create another
type here with with your rates or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/723-1
02:32:13.682 --> 02:32:19.934
<v Ricky Horton>anything. Take all these well type nacks,
put it in the no well things so that when</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/723-2
02:32:19.934 --> 02:32:23.580
<v Ricky Horton>they come in it has no rates to apply to
it now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/724-0
02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:28.646
<v Ricky Horton>I've done that with importing an IFC.
I'm assuming that his file works the same,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/724-1
02:32:28.646 --> 02:32:33.042
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm not. I'm not 100% positive.
We just have to try it and see. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/724-2
02:32:33.042 --> 02:32:37.866
<v Ricky Horton>but you follow what I'm saying? Yes.
Do you want to try it? Yeah, let's do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/724-3
02:32:37.866 --> 02:32:42.507
<v Ricky Horton>So then just do a new one and create
whatever you want to call it where you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/724-4
02:32:42.507 --> 02:32:43.300
<v Ricky Horton>want to call.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/725-0
02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:44.860
<v Ricky Horton>Whale or whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/729-0
02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:14.265
<v Ricky Horton>By the way,
you see that convert wind length exceeds.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/729-1
02:33:14.265 --> 02:33:18.997
<v Ricky Horton>By the way,
that is newly paint as well 2025 I.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/729-2
02:33:18.997 --> 02:33:24.420
<v Ricky Horton>Basically you can set it to say if I have
a will this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/730-0
02:33:24.740 --> 02:33:30.485
<v Ricky Horton>20 feet, then converted to sun arc.
So that's kind of, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/730-1
02:33:30.485 --> 02:33:37.831
<v Ricky Horton>So it's they kind of built it for like if
I'm doing built up plate girders or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/730-2
02:33:37.831 --> 02:33:44.140
<v Ricky Horton>something like that or box columns and
I've got a longitude swell.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/731-0
02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:48.112
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't want to do it.
I want to do some work, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/731-1
02:33:48.112 --> 02:33:51.284
<v Ricky Horton>or something like that.
So that's what that's for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/731-2
02:33:51.284 --> 02:33:55.700
<v Ricky Horton>So add that and then we will then go back
to like fill it well manual.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/732-0
02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:02.433
<v Ricky Horton>Cut all of those out of weld type mapping
and then save this here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/732-1
02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:07.333
<v Ricky Horton>Then we'll go back over and we'll paste
that in in the no weld and it's going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/732-2
02:34:07.333 --> 02:34:10.298
<v Ricky Horton>be several other places throughout here
as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/732-3
02:34:10.298 --> 02:34:14.835
<v Ricky Horton>So you'll have to go back to like,
but I think they're all in the manuals.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/732-4
02:34:14.835 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Ricky Horton>Go to **** Weld manual. Yes,
you can grab all that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/733-0
02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/737-0
02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:41.300
<v Ricky Horton>Is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/738-0
02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:48.060
<v Ricky Horton>Penetration. Well, I've been planning.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/739-0
02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:51.766
<v Ricky Horton>So what,
you're just getting files from the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/739-1
02:34:51.766 --> 02:34:55.169
<v Ricky Horton>customer that has all this already filled
out? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/739-2
02:34:55.169 --> 02:35:00.114
<v Ricky Horton>essentially they'll supply us the kiss
file and and it'll all show up in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/739-3
02:35:00.114 --> 02:35:03.453
<v Ricky Horton>estimate extra,
which you have to run line by line,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/739-4
02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:05.700
<v Ricky Horton>part by part, assembly by assembly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/740-0
02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:11.334
<v Ricky Horton>And and majority of the time,
I mean it doesn't have any connotation to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/740-1
02:35:11.334 --> 02:35:16.614
<v Ricky Horton>it to what it could potentially go to.
You could go through and and do a full</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/740-2
02:35:16.614 --> 02:35:21.894
<v Ricky Horton>well take offline in the lower case.
The total inch of the welding here makes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/740-3
02:35:21.894 --> 02:35:22.300
<v Ricky Horton>sense.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/741-0
02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:29.585
<v Ricky Horton>But lots of times they'll have like a
16th of Weld and they'll have a weird</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/741-1
02:35:29.585 --> 02:35:35.626
<v Ricky Horton>size of Weld and it won't come in.
So it'll be a 0 size fillet and then a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/741-2
02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:41.340
<v Ricky Horton>bunch of inches or it'll be like a one
inch fillet and then it'll be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/742-0
02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:47.510
<v Ricky Horton>Like 300 of them and one inch long and it
just doesn't even justify to what you're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/742-1
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:51.251
<v Ricky Horton>trying to build.
So it doesn't always be recognized</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/742-2
02:35:51.251 --> 02:35:57.149
<v Ricky Horton>properly and then also just adds a lot of
time and I'm even going to do our labor</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/742-3
02:35:57.149 --> 02:35:57.580
<v Ricky Horton>codes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/743-0
02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:03.128
<v Ricky Horton>And run this through the way I'm going
through and it has time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/743-1
02:36:03.128 --> 02:36:08.626
<v Ricky Horton>I've never seen a detailer yet get all
the wheels right in the model.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/743-2
02:36:08.626 --> 02:36:13.260
<v Ricky Horton>I mean most of the jobs that I see come
through like on a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/744-0
02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:16.247
<v Ricky Horton>Like a sheer pad,
I'll see one-on-one side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/744-1
02:36:16.247 --> 02:36:20.079
<v Ricky Horton>not the other side.
And it's like I've got half the wheel</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/744-2
02:36:20.079 --> 02:36:25.034
<v Ricky Horton>that's worse than than not having
anything at all because I can apply that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/744-3
02:36:25.034 --> 02:36:29.460
<v Ricky Horton>to the labor case. So yeah,
I I like ignoring the wheels if I can.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/745-0
02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:31.700
<v Ricky Horton>Just makes no sales.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/746-0
02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:43.900
<v Ricky Horton>So how long does it take to go through
and apply wells correctly, everyone?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/747-0
02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:48.180
<v Ricky Horton>I need a project.
You got it depends on the project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/748-0
02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:56.041
<v Ricky Horton>It it's it's relatively easy to do, well,
especially if you're going to manual take</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/748-1
02:36:56.041 --> 02:37:02.116
<v Ricky Horton>off because you're going to apply the
labor can be repeated as you go through,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/748-2
02:37:02.116 --> 02:37:05.500
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not difficult at all to do if
you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/749-0
02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:09.727
<v Ricky Horton>Because you can globally add it,
you like pick all the sheer tabs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/749-1
02:37:09.727 --> 02:37:14.130
<v Ricky Horton>If I can identify all the sheer tabs and
then say apply one code to that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/749-2
02:37:14.130 --> 02:37:18.414
<v Ricky Horton>it's just a Y code which applies what is
along the length of the plate.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/749-3
02:37:18.414 --> 02:37:22.460
<v Ricky Horton>So it's not difficult to do as long as
you can identify the pieces.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/750-0
02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:26.510
<v Ricky Horton>If I can't identify the pieces,
now I got a problem.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/750-1
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:31.500
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what what what to apply so
you start getting involved.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/751-0
02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:35.674
<v Ricky Horton>It's definitely this.
This one's not a gas,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/751-1
02:37:35.674 --> 02:37:37.940
<v Ricky Horton>so actually we need to drive fine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/752-0
02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:55.300
<v Ricky Horton>Where you've got all sections,
you've got CJP's, PJP's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/753-0
02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:08.410
<v Ricky Horton>We got this one's a pretty sure's 14.
50 and he was getting involved in two</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/753-1
02:38:08.410 --> 02:38:14.903
<v Ricky Horton>meetings. We get close,
but we don't have any fill seconds that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/753-2
02:38:14.903 --> 02:38:17.540
<v Ricky Horton>are going to capture this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/754-0
02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:21.673
<v Ricky Horton>This gap in here are the amount of passes
required.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/754-1
02:38:21.673 --> 02:38:27.968
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of times all the labor code to
get the fitment hours in there and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/754-2
02:38:27.968 --> 02:38:34.500
<v Ricky Horton>some of the well hours and I'll add the
extras to account for the additional well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/756-0
02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:38.117
<v Ricky Horton>Additional time.
This is the one where I had to add</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/756-1
02:38:38.117 --> 02:38:43.063
<v Ricky Horton>heating and plates because we have 3 inch
plates even rolling in the flanges.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/756-2
02:38:43.063 --> 02:38:48.135
<v Ricky Horton>So we have BDDS and this one is probably
3040 units of drawing and this is at 5</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/756-3
02:38:48.135 --> 02:38:52.890
<v Ricky Horton>more wood. But you can build that.
I mean in fact there's a labor code for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/756-4
02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:53.460
<v Ricky Horton>the weld.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/757-0
02:38:54.380 --> 02:39:00.425
<v Ricky Horton>Is that the what M code I think it is for
the plate because that that's for the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/757-1
02:39:00.425 --> 02:39:04.580
<v Ricky Horton>four beam wheel.
Now there's nothing that says whether</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/757-2
02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:09.340
<v Ricky Horton>it's a single bem or double bem,
but I'm you could be on that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/758-0
02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:13.233
<v Ricky Horton>But there is a labor code to put the
welding boat there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/758-1
02:39:13.233 --> 02:39:17.278
<v Ricky Horton>the pre lead or something like that can
be built into it as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/758-2
02:39:17.278 --> 02:39:19.300
<v Ricky Horton>I've kind of built it in with um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/759-0
02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:25.954
<v Ricky Horton>With all all the plate labor codes to
where I'll have preheat in there for any,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/759-1
02:39:25.954 --> 02:39:29.090
<v Ricky Horton>maybe other for a certain size,
certain size,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/759-2
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:33.726
<v Ricky Horton>of course she's kind of preheat just for
setting it out to be hard,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/759-3
02:39:33.726 --> 02:39:39.180
<v Ricky Horton>but but all that can be built in without
you having to do it manually, so yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/760-0
02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:43.239
<v Ricky Horton>And then you have to find that piece by
piece. If you're, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/760-1
02:39:43.239 --> 02:39:48.400
<v Ricky Horton>if you're which most people are doing to
take off on this as they're going anyway,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/760-2
02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:53.312
<v Ricky Horton>they're entering each PC inside you're
getting the feature and put the code on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/760-3
02:39:53.312 --> 02:39:56.420
<v Ricky Horton>it. If I'm importing it from somewhere,
which is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/761-0
02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:02.443
<v Ricky Horton>SMC most shops don't end up doing,
but if I'm informing it yet,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/761-1
02:40:02.443 --> 02:40:09.268
<v Ricky Horton>then I got to select these pieces.
So it's it's fairly manual because the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/761-2
02:40:09.268 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Ricky Horton>system doesn't know what labor to apply
to the detail.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/762-0
02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:20.070
<v Ricky Horton>Once again,
you can import it and whales will come in,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/762-1
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:27.530
<v Ricky Horton>but what what it doesn't know about. OK,
cool, what about feed up layout QC,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/762-2
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:30.340
<v Ricky Horton>you know all its other stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/763-0
02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:35.821
<v Ricky Horton>Back then saw it to get in there.
So that neighbor can details it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/763-1
02:40:35.821 --> 02:40:41.455
<v Ricky Horton>So I didn't realize you had to go back
through the piece by piece estimating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/763-2
02:40:41.455 --> 02:40:45.140
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah,
because there should unless unless you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/763-3
02:40:45.140 --> 02:40:47.740
<v Ricky Horton>want to do just like a part per ton.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/764-0
02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:50.980
<v Ricky Horton>Thing on it,
which scared the **** out of it, you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/764-1
02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:55.495
<v Ricky Horton>So there's some people that do that and
they'll spit out a lot of instruments,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/764-2
02:40:55.495 --> 02:40:59.666
<v Ricky Horton>but man, it scares me when it happens.
So I'm curious what happens here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/764-3
02:40:59.666 --> 02:41:02.180
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't figured that out yet. Yeah,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/765-0
02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:07.322
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this one.
I have a feeling at this level it's piece</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/765-1
02:41:07.322 --> 02:41:10.752
<v Ricky Horton>by piece.
I have a feeling like the gilbert of why</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/765-2
02:41:10.752 --> 02:41:16.133
<v Ricky Horton>you're one guy that's just way more than
if the D if I'm importing some and the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/765-3
02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:18.420
<v Ricky Horton>detailer has stuff labeled nicely.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/766-0
02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:22.801
<v Ricky Horton>You can very quickly wobble it and pick
all the columns, put one K on it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/766-1
02:41:22.801 --> 02:41:27.580
<v Ricky Horton>pick all the filler bins, put one K on it,
pick all the stiffeners, put a K on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/766-2
02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:31.495
<v Ricky Horton>It's it can be very quick that way if the
detailer does a good job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/766-3
02:41:31.495 --> 02:41:33.740
<v Ricky Horton>If the detailer doesn't label anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/767-0
02:41:34.220 --> 02:41:42.782
<v Ricky Horton>Huh. Maybe it can be a pain. Now with AI.
So with like with AI thing I was talking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/767-1
02:41:42.782 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Ricky Horton>about,
it will actually engineer the connections.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/768-0
02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:54.982
<v Ricky Horton>And put that in and then we'll put a code
on all that for you. So yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/768-1
02:41:54.982 --> 02:41:59.036
<v Ricky Horton>that has figured it out,
but if I've got a bottle and I important</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/768-2
02:41:59.036 --> 02:41:59.220
<v Ricky Horton>to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/769-0
02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:05.180
<v Ricky Horton>I had some details,
but really great at that. So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/769-1
02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:09.340
<v Ricky Horton>shoot from the guy. Yeah,
when you say detailer to me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/770-0
02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:15.063
<v Ricky Horton>The detailer is either an external
detailer as part of the bid process,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/770-1
02:42:15.063 --> 02:42:20.007
<v Ricky Horton>or if it if you're bidding the job,
you may not even got involved in detailer</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/770-2
02:42:20.007 --> 02:42:23.746
<v Ricky Horton>yet, but you just have.
Maybe you have to check the files,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/770-3
02:42:23.746 --> 02:42:25.140
<v Ricky Horton>maybe you don't, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/771-0
02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:30.459
<v Ricky Horton>I do have clients that have,
they have 130 tons on a retainer,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/771-1
02:42:30.459 --> 02:42:36.477
<v Ricky Horton>a monthly retainer for X number of tons
and they'll they'll have them create a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/771-2
02:42:36.477 --> 02:42:39.981
<v Ricky Horton>model for every,
every estimate that they do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/771-3
02:42:39.981 --> 02:42:44.780
<v Ricky Horton>And like I got one client in Florida and
that's part of their.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/772-0
02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:50.385
<v Ricky Horton>I'll call it where every one of their
estimates comes with a model already and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/772-1
02:42:50.385 --> 02:42:55.559
<v Ricky Horton>I'm talking about a detailed model with
the miscellaneous and everything,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/772-2
02:42:55.559 --> 02:42:59.825
<v Ricky Horton>which is really to a great extent,
but that's kind of their,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/772-3
02:42:59.825 --> 02:43:04.020
<v Ricky Horton>that's what they're kind of known for and
it sells to both.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/773-0
02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:07.673
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they'll create the model for for the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/773-1
02:43:07.673 --> 02:43:11.036
<v Ricky Horton>estimate.
They'll import the with the labor on it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/773-2
02:43:11.036 --> 02:43:16.081
<v Ricky Horton>and estimate and the model goes to the
client with it and says we're done.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/773-3
02:43:16.081 --> 02:43:21.059
<v Ricky Horton>Based off of that, we can do what?
Hit the ground running. Yeah, exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/773-4
02:43:21.059 --> 02:43:22.740
<v Ricky Horton>And what else is in here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/774-0
02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:30.602
<v Ricky Horton>It kind of depends on what the estimating
department is doing is construction lines</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/774-1
02:43:30.602 --> 02:43:34.932
<v Ricky Horton>going through your building your own
assemblies.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/774-2
02:43:34.932 --> 02:43:41.735
<v Ricky Horton>You're looking at shelters and your
that's why the parametric assemblies can</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/774-3
02:43:41.735 --> 02:43:43.060
<v Ricky Horton>really hear me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/775-0
02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:47.601
<v Ricky Horton>The ones we have in there and the
estimators to having at home because then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/775-1
02:43:47.601 --> 02:43:51.769
<v Ricky Horton>you can you can go in there and enter
your parameters like a staircase that's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/775-2
02:43:51.769 --> 02:43:55.989
<v Ricky Horton>this long and this tall and this many
treads and then you just could go and it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/775-3
02:43:55.989 --> 02:43:58.340
<v Ricky Horton>populates all the material you need for
it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/776-0
02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.332
<v Ricky Horton>Because he's got to do this in type of
structures.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/776-1
02:44:02.332 --> 02:44:07.908
<v Ricky Horton>They're doing this in this here.
They're not doing any type of structures.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/776-2
02:44:07.908 --> 02:44:13.260
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody uses type of structures here.
So for the stuff that I do, I did.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/777-0
02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:21.290
<v Ricky Horton>So I get the I get the stuff that we're
looking at here. I get the kiss well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/777-1
02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:26.232
<v Ricky Horton>I get a model. I get.
I don't always get a model,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/777-2
02:44:26.232 --> 02:44:30.580
<v Ricky Horton>but I generally always get a kiss well
and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/778-0
02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:35.457
<v Ricky Horton>I get it detailed out, shop prints.
This is what we're building.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/778-1
02:44:35.457 --> 02:44:40.061
<v Ricky Horton>These are our low limits.
They might be in red A4 and sometimes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/778-2
02:44:40.061 --> 02:44:43.370
<v Ricky Horton>we're speaking to some better latency and
OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/778-3
02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:48.838
<v Ricky Horton>this is our price contention on no
changes between our A and red 0 and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/778-4
02:44:48.838 --> 02:44:50.420
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to get by 0.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/779-0
02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:56.108
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of times they have already bought
it in and we run the notch.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/779-1
02:44:56.108 --> 02:45:01.749
<v Ricky Horton>So I I do think you would you'll get
better buy in from the rest of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/779-2
02:45:01.749 --> 02:45:07.703
<v Ricky Horton>estimators if you build out some more
stuff in here such as different labor</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/779-3
02:45:07.703 --> 02:45:09.740
<v Ricky Horton>case and stuff because if.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/780-0
02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:15.124
<v Ricky Horton>If if they're going to have to do a lot
of manual adjustments on each line for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/780-1
02:45:15.124 --> 02:45:18.370
<v Ricky Horton>some of that stuff,
it's it's going to be frustrating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/780-2
02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:22.562
<v Ricky Horton>It's tedious it it it can be.
And so that's the key to the labor case.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/780-3
02:45:22.562 --> 02:45:26.694
<v Ricky Horton>It just makes it super simple.
So that that would be a key to getting</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/780-4
02:45:26.694 --> 02:45:29.940
<v Ricky Horton>buy in I think is building that out a
little bit more.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/781-0
02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:34.016
<v Ricky Horton>You know, Tesla has like a lot of the box,
right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/781-1
02:45:34.016 --> 02:45:39.918
<v Ricky Horton>And you go and teach people how to do it,
but then eventually everybody changes it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/781-2
02:45:39.918 --> 02:45:44.896
<v Ricky Horton>and becomes their own thing.
Right now I feel like you're taught kind</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/781-3
02:45:44.896 --> 02:45:46.460
<v Ricky Horton>of halfway in between.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/782-0
02:45:46.980 --> 02:45:49.552
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
And you've got all this stuff you wish</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/782-1
02:45:49.552 --> 02:45:53.019
<v Ricky Horton>would build out. Well,
if I'm doing a big job, I'll build it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/782-2
02:45:53.019 --> 02:45:57.212
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not going to be fine kind of sitting
there and intering each of those.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/782-3
02:45:57.212 --> 02:46:01.740
<v Ricky Horton>I know how to build labor codes if it's
something that should have benefited me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/783-0
02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:05.876
<v Ricky Horton>Like any of these nodes,
I don't know if you've seen the sheet</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/783-1
02:46:05.876 --> 02:46:09.706
<v Ricky Horton>there, but I actually, yeah,
I saw it with all the breakdowns and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/783-2
02:46:09.706 --> 02:46:12.607
<v Ricky Horton>development.
Most of the time it's increasing the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/783-3
02:46:12.607 --> 02:46:16.727
<v Ricky Horton>number of fillets or increasing the well
size and increasing all that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/783-4
02:46:16.727 --> 02:46:19.860
<v Ricky Horton>I'm dealing here and I think this is
because this is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/784-0
02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:24.992
<v Ricky Horton>In all our estimate or somebody deleted a
bunch of our labor codes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/784-1
02:46:24.992 --> 02:46:30.747
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe they want to function correctly,
but in here in our labor codes we'll add</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/784-2
02:46:30.747 --> 02:46:36.142
<v Ricky Horton>a type and then the welded size and then
a type because everything in your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/784-3
02:46:36.142 --> 02:46:37.940
<v Ricky Horton>defaults is quarter inch.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/785-0
02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:44.351
<v Ricky Horton>So then we'll go in and operate a new
labor code, same code, same code,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/785-1
02:46:44.351 --> 02:46:51.596
<v Ricky Horton>add a description and and then from there
I'll pick that and I'll run it across the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/785-2
02:46:51.596 --> 02:46:53.580
<v Ricky Horton>whole project and then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/786-0
02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:56.213
<v Ricky Horton>I usually try out the feed complex with
it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/786-1
02:46:56.213 --> 02:47:01.027
<v Ricky Horton>Usually it's just fillet size increasing
so that all of my involvement's captured.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/786-2
02:47:01.027 --> 02:47:05.030
<v Ricky Horton>They don't want to add something,
you know something not being used.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/786-3
02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:09.380
<v Ricky Horton>When you say product across the whole
project, you still have to identify.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/787-0
02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:18.663
<v Ricky Horton>How many are there for? Yeah,
so if I'm 10 or 15 and I don't have 516,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/787-1
02:47:18.663 --> 02:47:28.592
<v Ricky Horton>then I'll go in and I'll figure W516Y516
to Z516 so that when I go through the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/787-2
02:47:28.592 --> 02:47:29.220
<v Ricky Horton>next.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/788-0
02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:32.951
<v Ricky Horton>95 drawings.
I'm just going in for getting a 516 level</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/788-1
02:47:32.951 --> 02:47:37.969
<v Ricky Horton>that's throwing that one around there
instead of you know I was 10 drawings and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/788-2
02:47:37.969 --> 02:47:42.925
<v Ricky Horton>so I was early stage not not affecting
anything that it's incredibly ambitious</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/788-3
02:47:42.925 --> 02:47:47.567
<v Ricky Horton>for you to just going to that point and
then if I do it that way then I'm</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/788-4
02:47:47.567 --> 02:47:49.260
<v Ricky Horton>selecting this type adding.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/789-0
02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:53.891
<v Ricky Horton>Quarter range calculating out the well,
going down to additional part,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/789-1
02:47:53.891 --> 02:47:58.425
<v Ricky Horton>adding 16th of an inch of early,
which is technically getting me to the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/789-2
02:47:58.425 --> 02:48:01.762
<v Ricky Horton>same point,
but the better way to do it is to adjust</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/789-3
02:48:01.762 --> 02:48:05.540
<v Ricky Horton>the labor product because then things are
going to roll up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/790-0
02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:11.864
<v Ricky Horton>In the in the buckets that we have
associated, yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/790-1
02:48:11.864 --> 02:48:19.100
<v Ricky Horton>Karam on the meeting type of estimator,
they'll create if there's if there's a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/790-2
02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:25.420
<v Ricky Horton>bunch of one specific type of wellness or
a specific labor call out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/792-0
02:48:26.580 --> 02:48:30.076
<v Ricky Horton>He has enough to see what happened in
there. Bob,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/792-1
02:48:30.076 --> 02:48:35.668
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not 100% certain he has the amount of
scale around when they're confidently</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/792-2
02:48:35.668 --> 02:48:40.282
<v Ricky Horton>pretty straightforward.
You can duplicate it over and we can kind</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/792-3
02:48:40.282 --> 02:48:41.540
<v Ricky Horton>of adjust it, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/793-0
02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:47.236
<v Ricky Horton>Um, if you don't know what you're doing,
you can easily add one and apply it to an</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/793-1
02:48:47.236 --> 02:48:48.540
<v Ricky Horton>entire project and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/794-0
02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:53.432
<v Ricky Horton>Shoes.
So I've kind of restricted the Ron is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/794-1
02:48:53.432 --> 02:48:57.876
<v Ricky Horton>adding the codes.
Ron is the one who's telling his team</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/794-2
02:48:57.876 --> 02:49:03.193
<v Ricky Horton>members. And by the way,
I had a Y 716 in that project where I had</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/794-3
02:49:03.193 --> 02:49:08.907
<v Ricky Horton>so many well that that was 716.
This is going to get you that labor for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/794-4
02:49:08.907 --> 02:49:09.700
<v Ricky Horton>this type.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/795-0
02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:15.953
<v Ricky Horton>And and this is what you use it for and
and I would do the same thing if I added</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/795-1
02:49:15.953 --> 02:49:21.897
<v Ricky Horton>something that was like hey I was I was
using the B for seat plates and every</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/795-2
02:49:21.897 --> 02:49:27.765
<v Ricky Horton>single seat plate on my project was 3/8
well done. I had the B 3/8 in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/795-3
02:49:27.765 --> 02:49:29.060
<v Ricky Horton>I'll talk around.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/796-0
02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:32.064
<v Ricky Horton>Here in case you need it,
let everybody else know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/796-1
02:49:32.064 --> 02:49:35.081
<v Ricky Horton>But will he see it?
And then 'cause he's he's the same pull</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/796-2
02:49:35.081 --> 02:49:38.600
<v Ricky Horton>down, right? He'll see the pull down.
He'll have the same drop downs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/796-3
02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:40.460
<v Ricky Horton>It'll pop in across the board. So um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/797-0
02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:49.311
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the adjustments we're we're we're
kind of just working on electrical right</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/797-1
02:49:49.311 --> 02:49:55.205
<v Ricky Horton>now, right? Yeah, we got electrical.
Do you want to see two things I'm</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/797-2
02:49:55.205 --> 02:50:00.020
<v Ricky Horton>thinking since we're kind of running,
we ran through the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/798-0
02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:05.786
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to see that the I take off
thing for one thing? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/798-1
02:50:05.786 --> 02:50:10.175
<v Ricky Horton>And then another thing,
there are 30 some labor codes that came</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/798-2
02:50:10.175 --> 02:50:15.729
<v Ricky Horton>out of box that are need to be adjusted
like that half the wielding or something</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/798-3
02:50:15.729 --> 02:50:16.140
<v Ricky Horton>on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-0
02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:19.721
<v Ricky Horton>I think some of those we made adjustments
to last time. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-1
02:50:19.721 --> 02:50:22.519
<v Ricky Horton>I think we deal has gone through some of
them, but yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-2
02:50:22.519 --> 02:50:25.610
<v Ricky Horton>there's I guarantee there's a lot we did.
Yeah, that would be,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-3
02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:28.702
<v Ricky Horton>that would be awesome.
You want to get some labor codes first?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-4
02:50:28.702 --> 02:50:32.285
<v Ricky Horton>You want to see the AI label or do you
want? Let's do labor codes first,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/799-5
02:50:32.285 --> 02:50:35.180
<v Ricky Horton>because it's probably more important than
if we have time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/800-0
02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:36.820
<v Ricky Horton>See the Girls Club.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/801-0
02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:43.100
<v Ricky Horton>Um, so let's start at angle. Go to decode.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/802-0
02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:49.976
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, not there. Yeah,
let's click on the D labor code right</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/802-1
02:50:49.976 --> 02:50:51.100
<v Ricky Horton>there for angles.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/803-0
02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:55.060
<v Ricky Horton>All right. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/804-0
02:50:56.020 --> 02:51:02.661
<v Ricky Horton>See the welding right there?
It says 2 fillet welds at the quarter</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/804-1
02:51:02.661 --> 02:51:07.617
<v Ricky Horton>inch times perimeter standard clip P
notice is 2.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/804-2
02:51:07.617 --> 02:51:11.780
<v Ricky Horton>It should be 4 because there's four clips.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/805-0
02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:14.220
<v Ricky Horton>So but that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/806-0
02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:22.962
<v Ricky Horton>And the reason that standard clip P says
only two, that's putting clips on there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/806-1
02:51:22.962 --> 02:51:26.226
<v Ricky Horton>right?
But in the standard clips it says there's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/806-2
02:51:26.226 --> 02:51:29.956
<v Ricky Horton>two of these clips. So two sides,
2 * 2 gets your four,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/806-3
02:51:29.956 --> 02:51:33.220
<v Ricky Horton>but that it's not the same length of the
wheels.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/807-0
02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:38.671
<v Ricky Horton>And so they've got that screwed up.
E is going to be the same way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/807-1
02:51:38.671 --> 02:51:43.460
<v Ricky Horton>It's just weather clips on one end,
but you got one clip welded, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/808-0
02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:48.300
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
I don't know how often this is going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/808-1
02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:51.900
<v Ricky Horton>get used anyway. This is, yeah,
on two ends,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/808-2
02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:57.420
<v Ricky Horton>but this is screwed up as well.
But if you're never going to use it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/808-3
02:51:57.420 --> 02:51:59.980
<v Ricky Horton>we don't need to worry about it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/809-0
02:52:00.180 --> 02:52:04.143
<v Ricky Horton>So well, just, I mean,
that'll be more on instance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/809-1
02:52:04.143 --> 02:52:10.393
<v Ricky Horton>People have a job that has 40 in it and
then I don't want that to be our freaking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/809-2
02:52:10.393 --> 02:52:14.660
<v Ricky Horton>little gotcha. Yeah,
you see there it says burn manual.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/810-0
02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:20.060
<v Ricky Horton>So let's see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/811-0
02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:21.940
<v Ricky Horton>The um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/812-0
02:52:23.780 --> 02:52:27.513
<v Ricky Horton>So the burn,
it says to do that burning at the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/812-1
02:52:27.513 --> 02:52:32.674
<v Ricky Horton>thickness times the width. Well,
it makes no sense for an angle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/812-2
02:52:32.674 --> 02:52:36.645
<v Ricky Horton>That would make sense for a piece of
plate. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/812-3
02:52:36.645 --> 02:52:39.900
<v Ricky Horton>so we gotta modify that formula in order.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/813-0
02:52:40.180 --> 02:52:45.557
<v Ricky Horton>Or we'll create another formula to say
around the perimeter of the angle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/813-1
02:52:45.557 --> 02:52:50.860
<v Ricky Horton>We could say long leg, short leg.
There's various ways to say this, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/814-0
02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:56.140
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/815-0
02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:09.074
<v Ricky Horton>That one, Yeah. So let's new on that.
Then we'll change our, uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/815-1
02:53:09.074 --> 02:53:13.392
<v Ricky Horton>width down there. Yeah,
just edit length formula,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/815-2
02:53:13.392 --> 02:53:14.860
<v Ricky Horton>get rid of width.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/816-0
02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:20.860
<v Ricky Horton>And I would probably just do perimeter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/817-0
02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:25.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, there we go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/818-0
02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:36.220
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, it's you back. No, we didn't.
I'm sorry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/819-0
02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:46.300
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's probably used on plate labor
and also I probably need it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/823-0
02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:12.220
<v Ricky Horton>And then L would be the same thing except
for just one end.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/825-0
02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:22.940
<v Ricky Horton>You left the K.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/826-0
02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:24.780
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/827-0
02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:29.894
<v Ricky Horton>It shouldn't have a well there.
That's only on the end,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/827-1
02:54:29.894 --> 02:54:32.780
<v Ricky Horton>so get rid of the well.
This is just full M prep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/828-0
02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:39.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/829-0
02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:42.140
<v Ricky Horton>Open world.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/832-0
02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:06.700
<v Ricky Horton>And the oak um code there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/833-0
02:55:08.220 --> 02:55:13.701
<v Ricky Horton>Is this ever going to happen?
You put slip clips on two ends of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/833-1
02:55:13.701 --> 02:55:17.732
<v Ricky Horton>neighbor.
It's not like they're going to do that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/833-2
02:55:17.732 --> 02:55:21.439
<v Ricky Horton>right?
But this is wrong and it's got welding</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/833-3
02:55:21.439 --> 02:55:24.260
<v Ricky Horton>for one clip. Might as well change.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/834-0
02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:26.660
<v Ricky Horton>Reason for some stupid thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/835-0
02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:35.740
<v Ricky Horton>All right, go to beams and D same deal.
Weld clips both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/835-1
02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:41.660
<v Ricky Horton>We need to get more welding on there and
with E as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/836-0
02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:52.044
<v Ricky Horton>Go down to K So we got full pin prep on
both ends of the beam.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/836-1
02:55:52.044 --> 02:56:00.700
<v Ricky Horton>Different fabricators want something
different here, so this is full pin prep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/837-0
02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:06.916
<v Ricky Horton>And it's only doing stuff on the on the
flanges, nothing in the way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/837-1
02:56:06.916 --> 02:56:10.347
<v Ricky Horton>So I've had some fabricators that are
like, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/837-2
02:56:10.347 --> 02:56:14.808
<v Ricky Horton>let's just go ahead and plan a full pin
prep in the web as well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/837-3
02:56:14.808 --> 02:56:16.180
<v Ricky Horton>which is not common.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/838-0
02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:21.483
<v Ricky Horton>I just pointed out as it's only handling
stuff on the benches,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/838-1
02:56:21.483 --> 02:56:26.385
<v Ricky Horton>which is plain on to make see it's not
going to do it right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/838-2
02:56:26.385 --> 02:56:32.493
<v Ricky Horton>So I just point that one out because I've
had some that that want something</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/838-3
02:56:32.493 --> 02:56:34.180
<v Ricky Horton>happening and then M.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/839-0
02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:41.865
<v Ricky Horton>Go to EM full pin prep and weld. OK,
so this is getting welding on the flanges.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/839-1
02:56:41.865 --> 02:56:46.236
<v Ricky Horton>So this is right with everything in the
flange.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/839-2
02:56:46.236 --> 02:56:50.880
<v Ricky Horton>Others will have a fillet weld in the web
as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/839-3
02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:54.340
<v Ricky Horton>So nothing's happening in in the weld.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/840-0
02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:57.740
<v Ricky Horton>In the way of the year, so yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/841-0
02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:07.574
<v Ricky Horton>So we probably just a fillet weld is all
we want there, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/841-1
02:57:07.574 --> 02:57:13.519
<v Ricky Horton>So then you got to figure out, OK,
what size fillet weld and we might have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/841-2
02:57:13.519 --> 02:57:19.780
<v Ricky Horton>to create a formula because we're going
to need a fillet weld along the depth.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/844-0
02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:36.173
<v Ricky Horton>Width at length. So yeah,
unless we see something that says we'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/844-1
02:57:36.173 --> 02:57:39.020
<v Ricky Horton>probably have to create one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/845-0
02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:42.140
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/846-0
02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:56.268
<v Ricky Horton>And probably something bigger, right?
And we want to do like a 3/8 rail or want</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/846-1
02:57:56.268 --> 02:57:58.540
<v Ricky Horton>to make the garage.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/847-0
02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:05.740
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm probably saying, yeah,
if you want to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/848-0
02:58:08.100 --> 02:58:13.043
<v Ricky Horton>And then we'll just change the length
down there. Oh yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/848-1
02:58:13.043 --> 02:58:16.980
<v Ricky Horton>in the size and what it is, 375.
There you go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/849-0
02:58:22.420 --> 02:58:23.460
<v Ricky Horton>And there's they got.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/850-0
02:58:26.020 --> 02:58:26.060
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/851-0
02:58:29.140 --> 02:58:34.274
<v Ricky Horton>It's the fact that we didn't hit.
I had a variable hit in it like the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/851-1
02:58:34.274 --> 02:58:34.860
<v Ricky Horton>formula.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/852-0
02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:35.100
<v Ricky Horton>What?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/853-0
02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:45.300
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, I have variable.
I do that all the time. It's easy, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/854-0
02:58:46.580 --> 02:58:50.580
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I'm gonna keep one because I'll
have it memorized.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/856-0
02:58:58.460 --> 02:59:04.609
<v Ricky Horton>And that is not all of the labor codes,
but that that is what you would use</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/856-1
02:59:04.609 --> 02:59:09.707
<v Ricky Horton>probably 8500% down within the program
somewhere, right? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/856-2
02:59:09.707 --> 02:59:12.700
<v Ricky Horton>you you could get it that year, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/857-0
02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:16.359
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and you can see here all the ones that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/857-1
02:59:16.359 --> 02:59:20.683
<v Ricky Horton>we've added. So yeah,
the Htap there's quarters, creates 516,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/857-2
02:59:20.683 --> 02:59:23.822
<v Ricky Horton>so on and so forth,
but I even they're gone.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/857-3
02:59:23.822 --> 02:59:28.356
<v Ricky Horton>I use on so many different projects.
They split it on both ends,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/857-4
02:59:28.356 --> 02:59:29.820
<v Ricky Horton>basically on one end.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/858-0
02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:30.780
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/859-0
02:59:32.180 --> 02:59:35.591
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
it doesn't give you a detailed look at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/859-1
02:59:35.591 --> 02:59:39.002
<v Ricky Horton>him. No,
I just give you a verbal description.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/859-2
02:59:39.002 --> 02:59:44.300
<v Ricky Horton>That's all written description.
But I mean, I guess the reason you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/860-0
02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:54.605
<v Ricky Horton>How wouldn't I know that it isn't does or
does not have a fill a well on the to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/860-1
02:59:54.605 --> 03:00:01.940
<v Ricky Horton>here because it's just both of them.
I get that you don't know that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/861-0
03:00:02.260 --> 03:00:05.980
<v Ricky Horton>It was. That's both ends. So you're right,
you would need four.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/861-1
03:00:05.980 --> 03:00:08.420
<v Ricky Horton>You need two on this end, two on this end.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/862-0
03:00:09.060 --> 03:00:12.600
<v Ricky Horton>Because I would assume this would be a
plan.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/862-1
03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:19.208
<v Ricky Horton>And then the AM is what he's putting up.
I know it's, you'd assume what that? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/862-2
03:00:19.208 --> 03:00:24.007
<v Ricky Horton>Problem was there was a programmer doing
this to start with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/862-3
03:00:24.007 --> 03:00:27.940
<v Ricky Horton>Anybody didn't know anything about
stealing work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/863-0
03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:30.340
<v Ricky Horton>So when there's a updating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/864-0
03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:35.721
<v Ricky Horton>First pack 5, whatever.
Is this overwritten?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/864-1
03:00:35.721 --> 03:00:41.667
<v Ricky Horton>When does this get overwritten?
When we do it here, this would.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/864-2
03:00:41.667 --> 03:00:48.820
<v Ricky Horton>None of this setup is able to get
overwritten with an update. It's just the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/865-0
03:00:48.820 --> 03:00:52.787
<v Ricky Horton>That's we have our first data base. Yeah,
from scratch.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/865-1
03:00:52.787 --> 03:00:57.249
<v Ricky Horton>It's just a skeleton of the workings in
the background, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/865-2
03:00:57.249 --> 03:01:02.774
<v Ricky Horton>Not the the program itself, not the data.
So we're dealing with the data. So,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/865-3
03:01:02.774 --> 03:01:03.340
<v Ricky Horton>so then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/866-0
03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:10.220
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, slope clips. Weld both ends.
You need it for four clips there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/867-0
03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:18.667
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the little piece that we'll have,
well, two clips is right there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/867-1
03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:19.820
<v Ricky Horton>That's right. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/868-0
03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:31.098
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's that's correct.
T What is T Weldon moment? Both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/868-1
03:01:31.098 --> 03:01:37.340
<v Ricky Horton>All right, moment. There's nothing on the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/869-0
03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:45.603
<v Ricky Horton>T double s the welding.
Also the 10 1/2 inch should probably be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/869-1
03:01:45.603 --> 03:01:49.220
<v Ricky Horton>more change to what the foot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/870-0
03:01:53.980 --> 03:02:03.740
<v Ricky Horton>And what's the welding? OK, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/872-0
03:02:12.620 --> 03:02:15.697
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
this is with the with this is with the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/872-1
03:02:15.697 --> 03:02:20.635
<v Ricky Horton>additional clips on the flanges.
So you're you're filling well there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/872-2
03:02:20.635 --> 03:02:25.500
<v Ricky Horton>around perimeter standard clip A should
be 4 cause you got 4 clips.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/873-0
03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:30.980
<v Ricky Horton>And then that right there two times
bottom.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/874-0
03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:35.100
<v Ricky Horton>How about if I'll burn your world?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/875-0
03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:45.277
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so chase the width of flames times 2 + 8.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/875-1
03:02:45.277 --> 03:02:49.820
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean, is T just a clip world or is T?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/876-0
03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:57.684
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So the key is, yes.
So you see you got the clinch on the top</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/876-1
03:02:57.684 --> 03:03:01.952
<v Ricky Horton>of the bottom. Yeah.
So I don't like the description. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/876-2
03:03:01.952 --> 03:03:06.860
<v Ricky Horton>the moment, both ends. Yeah,
we we was talking about a normal, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/877-0
03:03:09.780 --> 03:03:14.850
<v Ricky Horton>Well, yeah,
you're you're just talking about web</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/877-1
03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:23.231
<v Ricky Horton>clips on. Yeah, it was AD. Yeah, yeah,
D and then got added clips on the flanges</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/877-2
03:03:23.231 --> 03:03:25.300
<v Ricky Horton>as well. So that um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/878-0
03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:29.808
<v Ricky Horton>What I what I think of on this particular
line right here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/878-1
03:03:29.808 --> 03:03:33.933
<v Ricky Horton>it's got two fillet wells,
two quarters fillet wells,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/878-2
03:03:33.933 --> 03:03:39.892
<v Ricky Horton>and it's just saying I don't know what
size angle you're going to have on the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/878-3
03:03:39.892 --> 03:03:43.940
<v Ricky Horton>top of that.
I don't know how long it's going to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/879-0
03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:48.357
<v Ricky Horton>But 10 1/2 inches is probably it may not
be enough.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/879-1
03:03:48.357 --> 03:03:55.320
<v Ricky Horton>If you got a pretty wide flange then that
10 1/2 is just to me maybe a little bit</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/879-2
03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:59.567
<v Ricky Horton>too little.
We can change the formula like if I'm</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/879-3
03:03:59.567 --> 03:04:01.180
<v Ricky Horton>building to follow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/880-0
03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:05.567
<v Ricky Horton>In my default one,
I'm saying take the width of the flange</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/880-1
03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:09.813
<v Ricky Horton>times two. I don't know how much,
what size angle will last.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/880-2
03:04:09.813 --> 03:04:14.406
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if it's a three inch or 4
inch length. I don't know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/880-3
03:04:14.406 --> 03:04:20.114
<v Ricky Horton>I just thought of it to a four inch here.
So I said the width of the flange times</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/880-4
03:04:20.114 --> 03:04:20.740
<v Ricky Horton>two plus.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/881-0
03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:27.229
<v Ricky Horton>Can you get yours to get both sides of
the of the ankle and did that times four.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/881-1
03:04:27.229 --> 03:04:32.865
<v Ricky Horton>So I I I split the hairs here a little
bit, but I think it'll be more exact,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/881-2
03:04:32.865 --> 03:04:36.744
<v Ricky Horton>you know? Yeah.
So we need to change that here. Yep,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/881-3
03:04:36.744 --> 03:04:38.500
<v Ricky Horton>we need another formula.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/882-0
03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:50.907
<v Ricky Horton>Let me think if people bought,
you didn't use somebody like you who</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/882-1
03:04:50.907 --> 03:04:54.547
<v Ricky Horton>wouldn't know all this,
all this **** is wrong, 100% right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/882-2
03:04:54.547 --> 03:04:57.824
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what I tell people all the
time. I'm like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/882-3
03:04:57.824 --> 03:05:02.557
<v Ricky Horton>I've tripped and fallen and screwed up
and I I OK, so I figured all that out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/882-4
03:05:02.557 --> 03:05:04.620
<v Ricky Horton>Let me help you right there it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/883-0
03:05:04.740 --> 03:05:09.199
<v Ricky Horton>It's at the very bottom.
I guess the one that says two times,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/883-1
03:05:09.199 --> 03:05:11.860
<v Ricky Horton>two top and bottom of it there again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/884-0
03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:20.119
<v Ricky Horton>Now actually the quantity is going to be
correct because it's got two and we'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/884-1
03:05:20.119 --> 03:05:24.522
<v Ricky Horton>say it's all two meetings,
so which is unusual for all the other</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/884-2
03:05:24.522 --> 03:05:24.860
<v Ricky Horton>ones.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/885-0
03:05:29.020 --> 03:05:30.940
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm very.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/886-0
03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:40.273
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, put put back in there.
We we got to exchange with times 2</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/886-1
03:05:40.273 --> 03:05:45.798
<v Ricky Horton>because we got to have this side,
this side of the floor and then we got to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/886-2
03:05:45.798 --> 03:05:51.613
<v Ricky Horton>and then we're going to add any issues
something like 4 inch angle or something</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/886-3
03:05:51.613 --> 03:05:52.340
<v Ricky Horton>like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/887-0
03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:58.020
<v Ricky Horton>So T is a clip only connection, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/888-0
03:05:59.540 --> 03:06:05.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
top up and the clips are going to the web.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/889-0
03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:12.770
<v Ricky Horton>I'm always used to the phone connection
with the public. Yeah, you're right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/889-1
03:06:12.770 --> 03:06:16.652
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the time. OK,
we would use this very often.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/889-2
03:06:16.652 --> 03:06:22.775
<v Ricky Horton>I can't think of being behind. I'm not.
I'm not like, yeah, somebody just saying,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/889-3
03:06:22.775 --> 03:06:23.820
<v Ricky Horton>you know what?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/890-0
03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:28.820
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, no, it should be welded.
So they really should be yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/891-0
03:06:30.460 --> 03:06:30.940
<v Ricky Horton>That's good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/892-0
03:06:32.820 --> 03:06:36.173
<v Ricky Horton>But what's funny is that just that's the
whole plan.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/892-1
03:06:36.173 --> 03:06:39.020
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't call the mobile connection,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/893-0
03:06:41.220 --> 03:06:46.587
<v Ricky Horton>So actually that makes the gobbing just
that they don't just go to connections.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/893-1
03:06:46.587 --> 03:06:51.552
<v Ricky Horton>The only considerable one is said by the
it's not a lot of you to do some</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/893-2
03:06:51.552 --> 03:06:55.913
<v Ricky Horton>engineer's capital. Yeah,
earthquakes and all that kind of ****.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/893-3
03:06:55.913 --> 03:07:00.340
<v Ricky Horton>So they're going to establish certain
ones as moment connections.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/894-0
03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:05.303
<v Ricky Horton>You still have a lot of other concern,
but the team more than the sit at the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/894-1
03:07:05.303 --> 03:07:09.826
<v Ricky Horton>moment connections, but they're wellness.
They're wellness same, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/894-2
03:07:09.826 --> 03:07:14.770
<v Ricky Horton>it's just have they have certain specific
ones that they refer to as a search for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/894-3
03:07:14.770 --> 03:07:16.820
<v Ricky Horton>the engineers. Those are the ones.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/895-0
03:07:16.980 --> 03:07:20.500
<v Ricky Horton>Relating to It's weird.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/896-0
03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:27.341
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on there.
So I I don't know that I'm worried about</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/896-1
03:07:27.341 --> 03:07:33.352
<v Ricky Horton>it. Yeah, yeah, it's a custom one. So, OK,
standard base plates, is that not in here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/896-2
03:07:33.352 --> 03:07:38.175
<v Ricky Horton>You will change their base plates.
So when you when you do a column,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/896-3
03:07:38.175 --> 03:07:40.900
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to put an H on it if it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/897-0
03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:45.302
<v Ricky Horton>And so it puts the welding on the column
because it is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/897-1
03:07:45.302 --> 03:07:48.571
<v Ricky Horton>it knows the exact perimeter of the
column,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/897-2
03:07:48.571 --> 03:07:52.286
<v Ricky Horton>so it knows exactly how many inches to
put on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/897-3
03:07:52.286 --> 03:07:57.042
<v Ricky Horton>So then with so we don't need to put
welding on the base plate,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/897-4
03:07:57.042 --> 03:08:00.980
<v Ricky Horton>it's just going to be an A which is just
cutting it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/898-0
03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:07.287
<v Ricky Horton>That's why we have type page half inch
quarter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/898-1
03:08:07.287 --> 03:08:13.480
<v Ricky Horton>This is what you get right up there and
the feedback you had was paid.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/898-2
03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:16.620
<v Ricky Horton>We all of these did have additional.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/899-0
03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:21.287
<v Ricky Horton>Options to pick from for top and well,
all those changes we made to the well</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/899-1
03:08:21.287 --> 03:08:24.196
<v Ricky Horton>yesterday.
Those were all going to be affected now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/899-2
03:08:24.196 --> 03:08:26.992
<v Ricky Horton>right?
Because we changed the timing of the well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/899-3
03:08:26.992 --> 03:08:29.901
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yeah.
So everything we did yesterday affects</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/899-4
03:08:29.901 --> 03:08:30.460
<v Ricky Horton>all of us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/900-0
03:08:32.380 --> 03:08:37.914
<v Ricky Horton>So you on beans is you'll change that
formula right there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/900-1
03:08:37.914 --> 03:08:40.540
<v Ricky Horton>that second one there, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/901-0
03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:45.140
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and you only need more actually.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/903-0
03:08:47.820 --> 03:08:52.534
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so this is wrong too.
They had a good and wrong quantity on on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/903-1
03:08:52.534 --> 03:08:56.428
<v Ricky Horton>those as well.
The V code which is welded in plates both</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/903-2
03:08:56.428 --> 03:08:59.503
<v Ricky Horton>ends,
which is just sheer pads on both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/903-3
03:08:59.503 --> 03:09:03.260
<v Ricky Horton>I hate that description.
This sheer pads on both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/904-0
03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:09.378
<v Ricky Horton>So there should be welding along the
length of the standard clip,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/904-1
03:09:09.378 --> 03:09:15.228
<v Ricky Horton>not the width. You see the.
So basically if we had a four inch by 6</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/904-2
03:09:15.228 --> 03:09:20.390
<v Ricky Horton>inch shooter tab,
it's putting the welding on the four inch</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/904-3
03:09:20.390 --> 03:09:20.820
<v Ricky Horton>side.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/905-0
03:09:20.940 --> 03:09:25.900
<v Ricky Horton>So we need to change that to the length
of the standard, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/906-0
03:09:32.940 --> 03:09:39.089
<v Ricky Horton>100 bucks. I'll put 100,000 on it.
90% of the fabricators haven't looked at</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/906-1
03:09:39.089 --> 03:09:44.105
<v Ricky Horton>these to know. Yeah,
they don't know that they're putting the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/906-2
03:09:44.105 --> 03:09:47.260
<v Ricky Horton>wrong stuff on there. Holy cow, I mean.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/907-0
03:09:50.820 --> 03:09:54.575
<v Ricky Horton>It's integral screw. It is.
I've sent this to tech. As I said,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/907-1
03:09:54.575 --> 03:09:58.091
<v Ricky Horton>here's these changes you need to make on
your fault setup.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/907-2
03:09:58.091 --> 03:10:01.905
<v Ricky Horton>But there are there's got to be people.
I don't know about God.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/907-3
03:10:01.905 --> 03:10:06.435
<v Ricky Horton>You're doing the same thing over and over
and over. It's your it's outline.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/907-4
03:10:06.435 --> 03:10:08.580
<v Ricky Horton>You've got to figure out why if you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/908-0
03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:13.681
<v Ricky Horton>Yep,
they're going through putting the cage on,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/908-1
03:10:13.681 --> 03:10:19.731
<v Ricky Horton>trusting that it's right and never
looking to see if it is the exact amount</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/908-2
03:10:19.731 --> 03:10:26.020
<v Ricky Horton>of weld or if it's that they're just does
technically do tubes to base plates.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/909-0
03:10:26.460 --> 03:10:30.780
<v Ricky Horton>Two, it's a column. It's a difference.
Two column.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/909-1
03:10:30.780 --> 03:10:37.303
<v Ricky Horton>Two column goes through the baseline.
Is it automatically set up to all from</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/909-2
03:10:37.303 --> 03:10:42.046
<v Ricky Horton>one side? No,
it's when you're going to attach the tube</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/909-3
03:10:42.046 --> 03:10:46.620
<v Ricky Horton>to the top of the baseline. Yes, well,
it's probably.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/910-0
03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:51.366
<v Ricky Horton>It's still more time.
I still didn't see what you're talking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/910-1
03:10:51.366 --> 03:10:54.020
<v Ricky Horton>about. It goes all the way through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/911-0
03:10:54.900 --> 03:10:56.980
<v Ricky Horton>That almost never happens that I've.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/912-0
03:10:57.940 --> 03:11:01.758
<v Ricky Horton>Have you seen it?
I think one of these light bulbs that are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/912-1
03:11:01.758 --> 03:11:04.875
<v Ricky Horton>here. Oh yeah, have that. Oh, interesting.
Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/912-2
03:11:04.875 --> 03:11:09.201
<v Ricky Horton>So you could be able to cage for that.
You did buy the light bulbs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/912-3
03:11:09.201 --> 03:11:14.100
<v Ricky Horton>I think I don't have. Interesting. Well,
because you got a bunch of massive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/913-0
03:11:14.660 --> 03:11:20.078
<v Ricky Horton>Hanging off that point or so, yeah,
to consider these estimators they are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/913-1
03:11:20.078 --> 03:11:25.422
<v Ricky Horton>using half of this **** anyways.
What they're doing is they're taking on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/913-2
03:11:25.422 --> 03:11:31.352
<v Ricky Horton>the race, they're taking on tall lights.
So they're necessarily using about them</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/913-3
03:11:31.352 --> 03:11:34.060
<v Ricky Horton>to me. They're not really using this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/914-0
03:11:34.180 --> 03:11:38.740
<v Ricky Horton>Assembly. That should be 4 as well,
because you're.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/915-0
03:11:39.780 --> 03:11:41.340
<v Ricky Horton>Because you're doing um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/916-0
03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:51.843
<v Ricky Horton>On both sides of the flip, on both ends,
W is going to be the same way,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/916-1
03:11:51.843 --> 03:11:59.820
<v Ricky Horton>just on one end. That's fine. That's fine.
You did the last time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/917-0
03:12:04.420 --> 03:12:11.060
<v Ricky Horton>Hear that and this.
We got something else to fix here too. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/918-0
03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:18.804
<v Ricky Horton>Back on the what we can do here,
the so this is sure has both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/918-1
03:12:18.804 --> 03:12:20.620
<v Ricky Horton>Notice there's no.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/919-0
03:12:22.940 --> 03:12:27.164
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so that one has holes.
The default has a box,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/919-1
03:12:27.164 --> 03:12:32.486
<v Ricky Horton>but doesn't believe it or not.
It was also standard. Yeah. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/919-2
03:12:32.486 --> 03:12:35.020
<v Ricky Horton>so then you don't. There's no.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/920-0
03:12:36.100 --> 03:12:42.940
<v Ricky Horton>There is no field vaults here,
so if you uncheck show only included.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/921-0
03:12:45.060 --> 03:12:49.580
<v Ricky Horton>And then there should be a lot over here
for field balls.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/922-0
03:12:55.060 --> 03:13:03.180
<v Ricky Horton>Right there. So you need to for both ends.
Then they do same on W for one end.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/925-0
03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:13.980
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/926-0
03:13:16.220 --> 03:13:17.500
<v Ricky Horton>That's fixed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/927-0
03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:19.100
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/928-0
03:13:21.940 --> 03:13:24.780
<v Ricky Horton>Late we fixed the burner, did we?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/929-0
03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:26.700
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/930-0
03:13:28.220 --> 03:13:28.980
<v Ricky Horton>Play indeed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/931-0
03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:36.460
<v Ricky Horton>So this is if you're doing and I've used
this for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/932-0
03:13:38.100 --> 03:13:41.743
<v Ricky Horton>It's rare,
but I've used to grab the clips on both</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/932-1
03:13:41.743 --> 03:13:45.242
<v Ricky Horton>ends.
Like if it's a or really clips on one end,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/932-2
03:13:45.242 --> 03:13:51.169
<v Ricky Horton>somewhere it's like welded to the column,
but then it's got clips to get to get to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/932-3
03:13:51.169 --> 03:13:53.740
<v Ricky Horton>another beam or something like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/933-0
03:13:54.700 --> 03:13:59.043
<v Ricky Horton>So this right here, it's got the welding.
Once again, it's screwed up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/933-1
03:13:59.043 --> 03:14:02.100
<v Ricky Horton>It's got welding two clips instead of
four clips.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/934-0
03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:13.340
<v Ricky Horton>Same thing with E, which is 11 side.
So you need two wells. There you go, Cave.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/935-0
03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:16.140
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/936-0
03:14:17.460 --> 03:14:23.901
<v Ricky Horton>This is full him prep.
So the one we were looking at ran the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/936-1
03:14:23.901 --> 03:14:29.180
<v Ricky Horton>double on the plate,
but in the way of this does.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/937-0
03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:35.860
<v Ricky Horton>It does a prep on one end.
You see the burn there is just on one end,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/937-1
03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:38.660
<v Ricky Horton>so you need to bump that up to two.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/938-0
03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:50.856
<v Ricky Horton>And then go to the M code full pin Weld 2
ends and for full pin prep and Weld two</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/938-1
03:14:50.856 --> 03:14:57.300
<v Ricky Horton>is only has one end included for the prep
here as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/939-0
03:14:57.500 --> 03:14:57.620
<v Ricky Horton>The.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/940-0
03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:02.420
<v Ricky Horton>That should be a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/941-0
03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:08.460
<v Ricky Horton>That burn there should be two,
so it's got it's going to work on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/942-0
03:15:09.660 --> 03:15:14.654
<v Ricky Horton>Two ends of the so you got your plate.
It's going to do it on this side and this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/942-1
03:15:14.654 --> 03:15:16.380
<v Ricky Horton>side, so you really need to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/943-0
03:15:17.300 --> 03:15:17.580
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/944-0
03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:21.500
<v Ricky Horton>Um T.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/945-0
03:15:23.380 --> 03:15:28.060
<v Ricky Horton>Which is through plates. So this is um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/946-0
03:15:29.660 --> 03:15:38.060
<v Ricky Horton>So this is applied to the plate,
so that connection right there will apply</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/946-1
03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:44.220
<v Ricky Horton>to the plate.
So the you got to have four birds at the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/946-2
03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:45.340
<v Ricky Horton>width, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/947-0
03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:50.758
<v Ricky Horton>Burn there. Yeah, there we go.
Could because it's got to burn up this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/947-1
03:15:50.758 --> 03:15:56.776
<v Ricky Horton>side and back down the other side here,
up this side, down the other side, right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/947-2
03:15:56.776 --> 03:16:02.940
<v Ricky Horton>And then on you it's going to be the same
thing except for just you need two burns.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/948-0
03:16:03.340 --> 03:16:03.900
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/949-0
03:16:05.260 --> 03:16:06.940
<v Ricky Horton>All right, so V.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/950-0
03:16:08.820 --> 03:16:12.238
<v Ricky Horton>Is.
I don't know how often anybody uses this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/950-1
03:16:12.238 --> 03:16:16.771
<v Ricky Horton>but if you look at the guide,
reading of it. OK, so oh well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/950-2
03:16:16.771 --> 03:16:21.081
<v Ricky Horton>this is for plates. Yeah,
I was thinking of manual. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/950-3
03:16:21.081 --> 03:16:25.317
<v Ricky Horton>for plates. Yeah,
you use this all the time for gussets,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/950-4
03:16:25.317 --> 03:16:28.660
<v Ricky Horton>right?
So it includes welding on short legs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/951-0
03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:33.707
<v Ricky Horton>Which does not apply. That's an angle,
right? So get rid of that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/951-1
03:16:33.707 --> 03:16:38.900
<v Ricky Horton>So let's make sure we've got a little bit
on the leg that just with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/952-0
03:16:39.900 --> 03:16:41.580
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so it should be good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/953-0
03:16:44.780 --> 03:16:44.980
<v Ricky Horton>Rods.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/954-0
03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:48.980
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, go to K.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/955-0
03:16:50.500 --> 03:16:54.921
<v Ricky Horton>Once again,
how else were you doing a full PM prep on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/955-1
03:16:54.921 --> 03:16:57.540
<v Ricky Horton>two ends of a rod, you know? Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/956-0
03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:01.153
<v Ricky Horton>But this,
this wouldn't give you any labor for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/956-1
03:17:01.153 --> 03:17:05.891
<v Ricky Horton>burning because it says wall thickness.
There's no wall thickness for a rod.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/956-2
03:17:05.891 --> 03:17:09.399
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, I mean,
I I don't know if you'd want to fix it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/956-3
03:17:09.399 --> 03:17:13.460
<v Ricky Horton>You have to create a formally.
You never want to use this, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/957-0
03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:20.380
<v Ricky Horton>I almost even delete it, you know? Yeah,
L's the same way. It's just one end, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/958-0
03:17:22.420 --> 03:17:26.761
<v Ricky Horton>And M and N are the same way for PIM prep
and well, it's the same way,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/958-1
03:17:26.761 --> 03:17:31.469
<v Ricky Horton>but if you're never going to use those,
it's like how often is that going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/958-2
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:34.220
<v Ricky Horton>happen, right? All right,
tubes go to tubes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/959-0
03:17:35.820 --> 03:17:39.020
<v Ricky Horton>He makes a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/960-0
03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:47.696
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, go to Tubes and D Weld clips.
Both ends has welding for one clip on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/960-1
03:17:47.696 --> 03:17:54.186
<v Ricky Horton>each end. So yeah, very good.
And then E is going to be the same.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/960-2
03:17:54.186 --> 03:17:55.660
<v Ricky Horton>We just need 2.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/961-0
03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:58.060
<v Ricky Horton>Go to T.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/962-0
03:17:59.260 --> 03:18:05.740
<v Ricky Horton>All right, double S the welding.
So this is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/963-0
03:18:07.020 --> 03:18:10.994
<v Ricky Horton>Double S the welding.
Also tenant should probably have more. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/963-1
03:18:10.994 --> 03:18:13.500
<v Ricky Horton>this is the same thing as that other one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/964-0
03:18:14.740 --> 03:18:19.203
<v Ricky Horton>It does double the welding here,
so it's weldable at both ends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/964-1
03:18:19.203 --> 03:18:22.620
<v Ricky Horton>You need to change that four to two on
that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/965-0
03:18:25.020 --> 03:18:28.540
<v Ricky Horton>No, not on the weld itself, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/966-0
03:18:31.300 --> 03:18:36.745
<v Ricky Horton>And yeah, and then, yeah, the switch,
well, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/966-1
03:18:36.745 --> 03:18:43.169
<v Ricky Horton>the question is whether the 10 1/2 is
enough or not again,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/966-2
03:18:43.169 --> 03:18:50.900
<v Ricky Horton>but we can't use that and we've got the
land on on the two we have to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/967-0
03:18:50.940 --> 03:18:55.985
<v Ricky Horton>Say like you know the the width of the
tube or something like that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/967-1
03:18:55.985 --> 03:18:59.620
<v Ricky Horton>set a flange width in order to make that
happen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/970-0
03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:23.180
<v Ricky Horton>I think there's like 2 get out of the T
because it'll be down there 2 something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/971-0
03:19:25.380 --> 03:19:28.340
<v Ricky Horton>Tube depth and tube width, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/972-0
03:19:34.180 --> 03:19:34.380
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/975-0
03:19:52.420 --> 03:19:56.420
<v Ricky Horton>This is the last one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/976-0
03:19:59.700 --> 03:19:59.940
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/977-0
03:20:07.140 --> 03:20:10.649
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
I think that back at you down there to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/977-1
03:20:10.649 --> 03:20:11.740
<v Ricky Horton>your last one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/978-0
03:20:12.940 --> 03:20:15.780
<v Ricky Horton>It's just the same deal with the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/980-0
03:20:26.580 --> 03:20:26.820
<v Ricky Horton>Bye.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/981-0
03:20:30.340 --> 03:20:32.020
<v Ricky Horton>Banks have labor fields for me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/982-0
03:20:39.380 --> 03:20:45.598
<v Ricky Horton>If you not that we're going to do this,
but if you learn to create all this stuff</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/982-1
03:20:45.598 --> 03:20:50.224
<v Ricky Horton>for field direction, Yep,
you got to see increase your field</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/982-2
03:20:50.224 --> 03:20:54.850
<v Ricky Horton>welding times overshot times that when
you create a new one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/982-3
03:20:54.850 --> 03:20:59.020
<v Ricky Horton>it's got all new welding field
specifically for field.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/983-0
03:20:59.140 --> 03:21:01.740
<v Ricky Horton>Probably will be friends.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/984-0
03:21:03.180 --> 03:21:11.542
<v Ricky Horton>I would want to be able to differentiate.
The challenge of it is that when you're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/984-1
03:21:11.542 --> 03:21:17.660
<v Ricky Horton>in the estimate and you look up to the
top and the flowers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/985-0
03:21:18.300 --> 03:21:24.320
<v Ricky Horton>It would show,
it would include both in shower,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/985-1
03:21:24.320 --> 03:21:32.724
<v Ricky Horton>but the buckets we created,
the labour bridge will be reorganized.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/985-2
03:21:32.724 --> 03:21:37.740
<v Ricky Horton>We could create some that's a the field.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-0
03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:42.171
<v Ricky Horton>And actually a lot of the reports you
would see it all mix together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-1
03:21:42.171 --> 03:21:45.567
<v Ricky Horton>I already thought about it.
They're not going to change.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-2
03:21:45.567 --> 03:21:48.666
<v Ricky Horton>They're not going to.
I was sent down this morning.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-3
03:21:48.666 --> 03:21:53.015
<v Ricky Horton>That's my biggest battle everywhere.
It's just we're going to be able to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-4
03:21:53.015 --> 03:21:55.934
<v Ricky Horton>change their thought process and we're
going to,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/986-5
03:21:55.934 --> 03:21:57.900
<v Ricky Horton>they're going to keep everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/987-0
03:21:58.100 --> 03:22:03.933
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think about it.
So do you need to go have the direction</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/987-1
03:22:03.933 --> 03:22:11.132
<v Ricky Horton>we're going and think about how we do.
And it's like, yeah, I'm not listening,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/987-2
03:22:11.132 --> 03:22:17.420
<v Ricky Horton>but where they would move something like
silly they would not do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/988-0
03:22:17.580 --> 03:22:35.260
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like you're saving money.
We go much faster because.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/989-0
03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:39.023
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, OK, yeah,
I was teaching about the same part,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/989-1
03:22:39.023 --> 03:22:41.180
<v Ricky Horton>you know, it's like that makes sense.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/990-0
03:22:42.060 --> 03:22:44.660
<v Ricky Horton>That's not being expound.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/991-0
03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:57.976
<v Ricky Horton>I shouldn't care. I actually, I'm glad,
but ultimately, it helps your customers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/991-1
03:22:57.976 --> 03:23:05.300
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm just too much interested to sit
there and say, well, I can't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/992-0
03:23:05.580 --> 03:23:08.946
<v Ricky Horton>$140,
000 in the payroll that people do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/992-1
03:23:08.946 --> 03:23:13.236
<v Ricky Horton>something to this.
I can't sit there and say yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/992-2
03:23:13.236 --> 03:23:18.957
<v Ricky Horton>what about your business?
I'm trying to get a holiday. Like I said,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/992-3
03:23:18.957 --> 03:23:21.060
<v Ricky Horton>it was about two minutes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/993-0
03:23:21.660 --> 03:23:26.935
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. I know you guys.
So I know I'm not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/993-1
03:23:26.935 --> 03:23:31.220
<v Ricky Horton>I don't understand people for 45 years.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/994-0
03:23:32.820 --> 03:23:38.759
<v Ricky Horton>I did it so long ago.
I used to be in everything we've done on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/994-1
03:23:38.759 --> 03:23:46.395
<v Ricky Horton>the scratch pad. 50 of these. Yeah, I did.
It's kind of like detail on board and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/994-2
03:23:46.395 --> 03:23:48.940
<v Ricky Horton>then you have some of that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/995-0
03:23:50.300 --> 03:24:00.796
<v Ricky Horton>They were not. He did not.
I've never actually run anything enough.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/995-1
03:24:00.796 --> 03:24:05.580
<v Ricky Horton>I suck at it. I used to run it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/998-0
03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:48.700
<v Ricky Horton>Model, you brought it home.
It's going to be better to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/999-0
03:24:49.580 --> 03:25:08.420
<v Ricky Horton>At least Jeremy may be not. I'm sure.
RIT guys, retire.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1000-0
03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:19.351

<v Ricky Horton>So he made all these different little
late characters.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1003-0

<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1005-0
03:26:19.180 --> 03:26:33.780
<v Ricky Horton>For all these waiting, probably.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1006-0
03:26:34.460 --> 03:26:45.060
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think that's right.
I think you're about to find out. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1006-1
03:26:45.060 --> 03:26:49.580
<v Ricky Horton>I think you want to find out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1007-0
03:26:51.460 --> 03:26:59.020
<v Ricky Horton>And he is the kind of the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1008-0
03:27:00.420 --> 03:27:00.980
<v Ricky Horton>That.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1009-0
03:27:10.940 --> 03:27:12.900
<v Ricky Horton>They're doing this fast.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1010-0
03:27:14.500 --> 03:27:19.487
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if you got me talking
sometime before you leave.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1010-1
03:27:19.487 --> 03:27:26.002
<v Ricky Horton>I get the sense that one of the questions
I want to be asked was can we use what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1010-2
03:27:26.002 --> 03:27:29.540
<v Ricky Horton>you have in the four times with each
other?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1011-0
03:27:30.980 --> 03:27:32.580
<v Ricky Horton>Trades.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1012-0
03:27:33.980 --> 03:27:39.060
<v Ricky Horton>I think the answer is they could probably
do anything, but as a man, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1013-0
03:27:40.540 --> 03:27:44.065
<v Ricky Horton>But it's just tents.
I was at a shop last week. There is tents.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1013-1
03:27:44.065 --> 03:27:47.700
<v Ricky Horton>I'd be curious what that would look like.
Is that a lot of stuff?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1014-0
03:27:48.940 --> 03:27:54.140
<v Ricky Horton>Or is it out-of-the-box?
The out-of-the-box part would be you got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1014-1
03:27:54.140 --> 03:28:00.049
<v Ricky Horton>blanks and everything on the right.
The the the set up stuff would be like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1014-2
03:28:00.049 --> 03:28:06.274
<v Ricky Horton>the flanges and all the other stuff you
might have to put on this to be like a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1014-3
03:28:06.274 --> 03:28:07.140
<v Ricky Horton>little new.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1015-0
03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:08.580
<v Ricky Horton>The God.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1016-0
03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:14.821
<v Ricky Horton>I won't say non steel,
but you know what I'm saying.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1016-1
03:28:14.821 --> 03:28:20.020
<v Ricky Horton>The non conventional shapes.
So let's say you have a shell that's a 10</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1016-2
03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:23.827
<v Ricky Horton>foot 9 tank.
You've had a stretch out in 31 feet or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1016-3
03:28:23.827 --> 03:28:27.195
<v Ricky Horton>whatever.
It's it'll pick all that labeled up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1016-4
03:28:27.195 --> 03:28:28.220
<v Ricky Horton>automatically.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1017-0
03:28:28.580 --> 03:28:31.655
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
you you would just build out labor codes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1017-1
03:28:31.655 --> 03:28:35.972
<v Ricky Horton>specifically for that stuff.
So there would be set up for like in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1017-2
03:28:35.972 --> 03:28:39.700
<v Ricky Horton>estimating the the you'd have to build
labor credit for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1018-0
03:28:41.700 --> 03:28:47.228
<v Ricky Horton>It's like same deal with like ridge type
guys, like I've been spinner,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1018-1
03:28:47.228 --> 03:28:50.420
<v Ricky Horton>which is what the end way we go to waste.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1019-0
03:28:51.420 --> 03:28:54.535
<v Ricky Horton>Used to build the labor codes to do what
you want to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1019-1
03:28:54.535 --> 03:28:59.016
<v Ricky Horton>So with bridge type guys I'll have to do
the build up bridge grooers and what not</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1019-2
03:28:59.016 --> 03:28:59.180
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1020-0
03:28:59.260 --> 03:29:08.100
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, Nope, it's not.
It just takes a little bit of set up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1022-0
03:29:12.740 --> 03:29:21.778
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I used to do all this stuff. Yeah,
I like, I know they, I know those people.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1022-1
03:29:21.778 --> 03:29:22.540
<v Ricky Horton>Mm-hmm.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1025-0
03:29:35.580 --> 03:29:41.558
<v Ricky Horton>Anybody track bikes?
I don't know anybody doing it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1025-1
03:29:41.558 --> 03:29:50.180
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't describe if there's if there's
not somebody out there doing it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1026-0
03:29:50.660 --> 03:29:54.660
<v Ricky Horton>I got a bond in Wisconsin that talked
about doing it, but they.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1027-0
03:29:55.620 --> 03:30:02.340
<v Ricky Horton>They never really get there.
I don't know why, but we like the track.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1028-0
03:30:04.100 --> 03:30:04.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1029-0
03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:06.020
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1030-0
03:30:07.620 --> 03:30:13.260
<v Ricky Horton>I don't like being Yeah, it does.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1031-0
03:30:14.660 --> 03:30:18.580
<v Ricky Horton>They sent me their drawings.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1032-0
03:30:20.580 --> 03:30:25.272
<v Ricky Horton>That client that I was thinking about
doing, they sent me the drones for it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1032-1
03:30:25.272 --> 03:30:28.319
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just used to structure on this one.
You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1032-2
03:30:28.319 --> 03:30:32.097
<v Ricky Horton>I'm looking at their pipe drones and like,
what about living?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1032-3
03:30:32.097 --> 03:30:34.900
<v Ricky Horton>It's just a bunch of lines.
It was different.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1033-0
03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:48.652
<v Ricky Horton>Probably bothered me.
Everybody knows all of this stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1033-1
03:30:48.652 --> 03:30:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>They never give you the data. Exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1034-0
03:30:53.460 --> 03:30:53.580
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1035-0
03:30:56.620 --> 03:30:59.060
<v Ricky Horton>It's nuts that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1036-0
03:31:00.260 --> 03:31:05.855
<v Ricky Horton>It's the dumbest industry.
You got a architect that creates 3D to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1036-1
03:31:05.855 --> 03:31:12.383
<v Ricky Horton>put it into 2D to give to somebody else
to make it into 3D to give it in 2D.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1036-2
03:31:12.383 --> 03:31:15.180
<v Ricky Horton>It's like it's the dumbest cycle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1037-0
03:31:16.100 --> 03:31:18.460
<v Ricky Horton>I don't understand how we don't put that
****.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1038-0
03:31:19.460 --> 03:31:22.660
<v Ricky Horton>When you get these thousand drawings,
tool packages.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1039-0
03:31:23.620 --> 03:31:27.860
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, that's it. Give me the data.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1040-0
03:31:32.220 --> 03:31:37.460
<v Ricky Horton>No, we can't do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1041-0
03:31:41.540 --> 03:31:46.843
<v Ricky Horton>Now those new take out programs they have.
Those are pretty cool.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1041-1
03:31:46.843 --> 03:31:53.109
<v Ricky Horton>They're just spitting out the same.
This many columns this side and this many</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1041-2
03:31:53.109 --> 03:31:57.849
<v Ricky Horton>meetings this side. Well, again,
five guys the same thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1041-3
03:31:57.849 --> 03:32:00.660
<v Ricky Horton>It's all guns for you, except they.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1042-0
03:32:08.100 --> 03:32:11.248
<v Ricky Horton>Tell them when you get it,
if you have good relationship with the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1042-1
03:32:11.248 --> 03:32:14.300
<v Ricky Horton>owner, with the owner,
the owner forces them to give it to you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1043-0
03:32:15.980 --> 03:32:16.900
<v Ricky Horton>Possible.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1044-0
03:32:19.460 --> 03:32:23.845
<v Ricky Horton>He's like, hey, this is our data.
This is our fabricator.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1044-1
03:32:23.845 --> 03:32:26.340
<v Ricky Horton>Let's not waste everybody's time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1045-0
03:32:29.900 --> 03:32:31.020
<v Ricky Horton>This evening.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1046-0
03:32:32.980 --> 03:32:38.100
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Well, good. Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1047-0

<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1048-0
03:32:42.100 --> 03:32:48.340
<v Ricky Horton>You should be. They got models.
They get to check off the food layers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1051-0
03:32:59.900 --> 03:33:00.220
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1052-0
03:33:06.620 --> 03:33:06.860
<v Ricky Horton>Alright.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1053-0
03:33:07.940 --> 03:33:22.917
<v Ricky Horton>If there is any restriction, I don't know.
I mean in front of the bus and the street,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1053-1
03:33:22.917 --> 03:33:25.180
<v Ricky Horton>that's right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1054-0
03:33:25.460 --> 03:33:28.421
<v Ricky Horton>For some reason, I work.
I work in problems.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1054-1
03:33:28.421 --> 03:33:30.460
<v Ricky Horton>You know what to do about that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1055-0
03:33:31.540 --> 03:33:37.365
<v Ricky Horton>They almost told me I'm going to lose my
gallbladder. I was like, no, man,</v>

03:33:37.365 --> 03:33:43.500
<v Ricky Horton>I I like the repeats. I'm ********.
It's going to take everything from me, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1056-0
03:33:44.740 --> 03:33:51.420
<v Ricky Horton>No, stop being a *****.
I just made a ***** still.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1057-0
03:33:53.940 --> 03:33:58.300
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know the time to turn 21 is about.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1058-0
03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:23.660
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I think it was this weekend. Yeah. Oh,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1059-0
03:34:25.140 --> 03:34:34.300
<v Ricky Horton>I was here. Actually, I'm here.
I found something for today.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1060-0
03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:39.740
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1061-0

<v Ricky Horton>Sounds means.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1063-0
03:34:49.540 --> 03:34:56.824
<v Ricky Horton>Meaning, you know, that's it's like.
We need one back to coverage.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1063-1
03:34:56.824 --> 03:34:58.780
<v Ricky Horton>Matthew Garrett's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1066-0
03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:21.900
<v Ricky Horton>BBQ links, right? We'll bring in the BBQ.
We'll bring one out there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1071-0
03:35:49.500 --> 03:35:55.980
<v Ricky Horton>It's a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1072-0
03:36:02.700 --> 03:36:08.780
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, I'm sorry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1073-0
03:36:13.940 --> 03:36:14.300
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1074-0
03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:18.100
<v Ricky Horton>Were the odds successful?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1075-0
03:36:21.460 --> 03:36:31.740
<v Ricky Horton>They wouldn't be doing their job if they
didn't find it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1076-0
03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:42.860
<v Ricky Horton>They want your dues to keep coming in, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1077-0
03:36:44.220 --> 03:36:47.180
<v Ricky Horton>It might go one way or another, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1080-0
03:36:57.380 --> 03:37:04.232
<v Ricky Horton>I think I've seen about that.
There's the UL. Yeah, UL is horrible.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1080-1
03:37:04.232 --> 03:37:08.665
<v Ricky Horton>Really.
They make you so we were different.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1080-2
03:37:08.665 --> 03:37:13.300
<v Ricky Horton>Every design they want to essentially
have a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1081-0
03:37:14.420 --> 03:37:18.854
<v Ricky Horton>I'm personally involved.
They can make free visits and all they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1081-1
03:37:18.854 --> 03:37:21.500
<v Ricky Horton>doing is ripping off another code, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1082-0
03:37:23.540 --> 03:37:26.405
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like,
how in the world is this fossil</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1082-1
03:37:26.405 --> 03:37:29.884
<v Ricky Horton>exhausting? I think they asked itself.
It's funny.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1082-2
03:37:29.884 --> 03:37:34.999
<v Ricky Horton>They'll give you a list of five or ten.
Yeah, there's all them. Next year,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1082-3
03:37:34.999 --> 03:37:39.979
<v Ricky Horton>they'll find new things. You know,
like you didn't catch them last year,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1082-4
03:37:39.979 --> 03:37:41.820
<v Ricky Horton>but they all used to smile.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1083-0
03:37:42.220 --> 03:37:46.540
<v Ricky Horton>Find something to get your money,
get their money.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1084-0
03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:49.860
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the one that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1085-0
03:37:51.860 --> 03:37:55.627
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
for us with a pain in the *** was ISO.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1085-1
03:37:55.627 --> 03:37:59.316
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
because Charles ISO guy was the aerospace</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1085-2
03:37:59.316 --> 03:38:03.851
<v Ricky Horton>guy and we were doing that.
And so he's perceived. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1085-3
03:38:03.851 --> 03:38:07.540
<v Ricky Horton>ISO is only who would you say,
say what you do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1086-0
03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:13.893
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but he was.
He had written some procedures like so</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1086-1
03:38:13.893 --> 03:38:22.920
<v Ricky Horton>handcuffed and for our aerospace business,
we could do one thing for finding his</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1086-2
03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:23.700
<v Ricky Horton>people.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1087-0
03:38:23.780 --> 03:38:30.620
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you're like,
what the **** writes these procedures for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1087-1
03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:31.180
<v Ricky Horton>this?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1088-0
03:38:34.140 --> 03:38:38.584
<v Ricky Horton>****,
we gotta put a section that says for this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1088-1
03:38:38.584 --> 03:38:40.620
<v Ricky Horton>slide, for that slide.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1089-0
03:38:42.900 --> 03:38:50.586
<v Ricky Horton>But I still hates that they want the
single standard in the whole facility.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1089-1
03:38:50.586 --> 03:38:58.372
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to go on the separate our
business and OK, this is aerospace only.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1089-2
03:38:58.372 --> 03:39:00.900
<v Ricky Horton>That's two year business.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1090-0
03:39:00.940 --> 03:39:08.413
<v Ricky Horton>I've seen companies do that for us,
even when it comes to union and non union.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1090-1
03:39:08.413 --> 03:39:15.507
<v Ricky Horton>OK, we got one that's over here,
it's non union and we got one that's over</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1090-2
03:39:15.507 --> 03:39:15.980
<v Ricky Horton>here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1091-0
03:39:16.060 --> 03:39:21.380
<v Ricky Horton>No, that's what it says.
Solved the problem. Yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1093-0
03:39:23.660 --> 03:39:29.820
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure it creates function.
I spent the whole day.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1094-0
03:39:32.380 --> 03:39:36.440
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm saying she wants a ship like the
union, not union,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1094-1
03:39:36.440 --> 03:39:40.980
<v Ricky Horton>wants to put the shops in different parts
of the city. Hey, what?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1095-0
03:39:42.580 --> 03:39:48.279
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
I wish the role of withdrawal is possibly</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1095-1
03:39:48.279 --> 03:39:56.827
<v Ricky Horton>on connecting with my new if not received
the new objective and Johnny and Tom will</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1095-2
03:39:56.827 --> 03:40:01.100
<v Ricky Horton>load your account and we'll automatically.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1096-0
03:40:01.660 --> 03:40:04.072
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it wasn't in the video until 15 or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1096-1
03:40:04.072 --> 03:40:04.660
<v Ricky Horton>something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1098-0
03:40:14.020 --> 03:40:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>Still we.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1099-0
03:40:17.460 --> 03:40:19.700
<v Ricky Horton>That is nothing to do with my phone.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1100-0
03:40:22.580 --> 03:40:23.780
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1101-0
03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:35.940
<v Ricky Horton>I thought it's 100 years,
so I was in the table.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1102-0
03:40:40.660 --> 03:40:50.620
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1104-0
03:40:58.780 --> 03:41:00.380
<v Ricky Horton>I'm the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1106-0
03:41:20.340 --> 03:41:20.820
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1107-0
03:41:24.500 --> 03:41:25.100
<v Ricky Horton>It and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1108-0
03:41:26.500 --> 03:41:28.420
<v Ricky Horton>And here it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1109-0
03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:30.820
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1110-0
03:41:32.380 --> 03:41:32.860
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1111-0
03:41:34.940 --> 03:41:39.940
<v Ricky Horton>It's basically about 30 different.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1112-0
03:41:43.420 --> 03:41:53.837
<v Ricky Horton>I'm here fix it.
I don't understand why I'm not fixing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1112-1
03:41:53.837 --> 03:41:59.140
<v Ricky Horton>like you know, I don't know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1113-0
03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:15.380
<v Ricky Horton>I saw them until about three months ago.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1116-0
03:42:36.540 --> 03:42:41.611
<v Ricky Horton>I said 8 months.
I need something in the second.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1116-1
03:42:41.611 --> 03:42:49.164
<v Ricky Horton>I guess you have a good relationship.
Do you think they'd listen to you?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1116-2
03:42:49.164 --> 03:42:53.820
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just going to keep wondering for my
car.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1119-0
03:43:15.780 --> 03:43:27.107
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.
You can't even touch it at home.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1119-1
03:43:27.107 --> 03:43:31.740
<v Ricky Horton>It's been touched.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1120-0
03:43:32.140 --> 03:43:37.022
<v Ricky Horton>It's still a few years ago,
I had a gal film and trained the smile</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1120-1
03:43:37.022 --> 03:43:41.466
<v Ricky Horton>and sober in moving.
She can do something that you're doing,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1120-2
03:43:41.466 --> 03:43:45.983
<v Ricky Horton>but the moving man,
this ***** and I've learned a lot of ****</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1120-3
03:43:45.983 --> 03:43:50.500
<v Ricky Horton>about moving. So I'm like,
how are you now? You know, moving.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1123-0
03:44:11.740 --> 03:44:27.660
<v Ricky Horton>I'm talking to and it's like the same,
but it's very, it's very short.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1124-0
03:44:31.740 --> 03:44:39.100
<v Ricky Horton>They're making money and they're like,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1125-0
03:44:40.100 --> 03:44:47.327
<v Ricky Horton>I've got,
I've got and and they're the ones that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1125-1
03:44:47.327 --> 03:44:56.175
<v Ricky Horton>were really kill me.
There's Adam and I've got one of these</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1125-2
03:44:56.175 --> 03:44:57.060
<v Ricky Horton>lists.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1126-0
03:44:58.620 --> 03:45:06.054
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but I assume wants to use want to make</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1126-1
03:45:06.054 --> 03:45:15.140
<v Ricky Horton>part of it. They don't want me to work.
They're doing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1127-0
03:45:17.420 --> 03:45:22.340
<v Ricky Horton>I need to learn it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1128-0
03:45:25.620 --> 03:45:32.740
<v Ricky Horton>Which I want you to know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1129-0
03:45:41.500 --> 03:45:44.836
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
I need this action model because we need</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1129-1
03:45:44.836 --> 03:45:50.322
<v Ricky Horton>this in in the empowerment. No,
give me that. I'm like, I don't trust me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1129-2
03:45:50.322 --> 03:45:56.475
<v Ricky Horton>So then I did my own research on some of
that stuff and I did with that. I'm like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1129-3
03:45:56.475 --> 03:45:58.180
<v Ricky Horton>can you tell me better?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1130-0
03:45:58.460 --> 03:46:06.980
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1131-0
03:46:13.500 --> 03:46:17.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I may be so mad that I just didn't.
But if I had done your work,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1131-1
03:46:17.700 --> 03:46:20.776
<v Ricky Horton>I could've done this and this way I also
should do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1131-2
03:46:20.776 --> 03:46:24.325
<v Ricky Horton>Here's how you're doing it so that we get
what we're doing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1131-3
03:46:24.325 --> 03:46:28.820
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's the only way you would.
Yeah, I think you're probably right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1132-0
03:46:29.020 --> 03:46:37.780
<v Ricky Horton>Details of answer to everything was magic.
Yeah, like the army.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1134-0
03:46:47.740 --> 03:46:48.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1135-0
03:46:49.500 --> 03:47:01.198
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I've achieved.
His settings were different than his</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1135-1
03:47:01.198 --> 03:47:08.300
<v Ricky Horton>settings, and they were they were.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1136-0
03:47:08.780 --> 03:47:15.553
<v Ricky Horton>To protect the structures to rewrite all
this land units and get all our past</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1136-1
03:47:15.553 --> 03:47:22.325
<v Ricky Horton>situaries. You can hear a little bit.
It's supposed to be there two weeks for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1136-2
03:47:22.325 --> 03:47:27.100
<v Ricky Horton>how much six months. We just,
we wouldn't let them be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1137-0
03:47:28.060 --> 03:47:42.692
<v Ricky Horton>That's what concerned me is that there's
detail being done by multiple entities.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1137-1
03:47:42.692 --> 03:47:45.220
<v Ricky Horton>We ended up a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1138-0
03:47:45.860 --> 03:47:54.582
<v Ricky Horton>Steve, you know, can you set the sentence,
get the sentence the way one of the bar</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1138-1
03:47:54.582 --> 03:48:02.569
<v Ricky Horton>shapes and the grade in the rubber
opinion and like our standard components</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1138-2
03:48:02.569 --> 03:48:04.460
<v Ricky Horton>and then put that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1139-0
03:48:04.860 --> 03:48:10.077
<v Ricky Horton>So you didn't want you there was internal
or external have you been on the new job</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1139-1
03:48:10.077 --> 03:48:14.855
<v Ricky Horton>and put that down because you can
understand and so that that helped a lot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1139-2
03:48:14.855 --> 03:48:19.192
<v Ricky Horton>But there were still times when external
details you didn't do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1139-3
03:48:19.192 --> 03:48:21.580
<v Ricky Horton>Then we get thought about the life of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1140-0
03:48:21.620 --> 03:48:27.024
<v Ricky Horton>If we couldn't get the internal detailers,
internal detailers, things,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1140-1
03:48:27.024 --> 03:48:32.885
<v Ricky Horton>all of our status, stuff like that.
There's a library park. Why is it there?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1140-2
03:48:32.885 --> 03:48:38.060
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, well, I did it this.
This is the library park. What's he doing?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1141-0
03:48:39.580 --> 03:48:43.620
<v Ricky Horton>Like we solved this problem 10 years ago,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1142-0
03:48:46.940 --> 03:48:54.669
<v Ricky Horton>We had to do that that morning,
maybe withdrawing everything you saw on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1142-1
03:48:54.669 --> 03:49:00.465
<v Ricky Horton>the regular,
you have to have multiple ordnels to run</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1142-2
03:49:00.465 --> 03:49:01.860
<v Ricky Horton>a data floor.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1143-0
03:49:06.940 --> 03:49:16.631
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think, yeah,
I think everybody needs to realize more</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1143-1
03:49:16.631 --> 03:49:23.620
<v Ricky Horton>than life is you're not inventing
anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1144-0
03:49:23.660 --> 03:49:27.540
<v Ricky Horton>If I could, you could think about,
it's probably already been done.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1145-0
03:49:34.820 --> 03:49:41.239
<v Ricky Horton>It's kind of funny. Years and a half ago,
they're building a fusion that you got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1145-1
03:49:41.239 --> 03:49:45.360
<v Ricky Horton>here in Boston.
I'm sure that is some accepted MIT.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1145-2
03:49:45.360 --> 03:49:50.115
<v Ricky Horton>So they came to us.
They said we want you guys to build all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1145-3
03:49:50.115 --> 03:49:51.620
<v Ricky Horton>the cooling panels.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1147-0
03:49:52.060 --> 03:49:56.889
<v Ricky Horton>Nice. Or exterior.
They're probably closer. You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1147-1
03:49:56.889 --> 03:50:01.629
<v Ricky Horton>they can see it's not over here.
You guys are weird.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1147-2
03:50:01.629 --> 03:50:08.425
<v Ricky Horton>So I look at it and they didn't really
know if they wanted somebody to draw</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1147-3
03:50:08.425 --> 03:50:09.140
<v Ricky Horton>nothing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1148-0
03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:17.246
<v Ricky Horton>They just, I mean, sample. Hey,
this is what we're going to do when you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1148-1
03:50:17.246 --> 03:50:26.140
<v Ricky Horton>drove. They just kept on on and on and on.
It's like, you know, you better just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1149-0
03:50:26.300 --> 03:50:30.888
<v Ricky Horton>Go down the road. They're building it.
Somebody's going there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1149-1
03:50:30.888 --> 03:50:35.257
<v Ricky Horton>Joseph is super cool thing.
I wanted to do it all the time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1149-2
03:50:35.257 --> 03:50:40.863
<v Ricky Horton>There's like a big school thing in the
building, but there were just panels,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1149-3
03:50:40.863 --> 03:50:41.300
<v Ricky Horton>right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1150-0
03:50:41.420 --> 03:50:47.149
<v Ricky Horton>Panels that they wanted to make on the
back of this and make it run cooling.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1150-1
03:50:47.149 --> 03:50:52.877
<v Ricky Horton>So my brain is like stainless panels,
stainless tubing, welded you together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1150-2
03:50:52.877 --> 03:50:56.820
<v Ricky Horton>It's not really exactly hard,
but they made it like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1151-0
03:50:59.300 --> 03:51:01.340
<v Ricky Horton>Can you hear one test on that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1152-0
03:51:02.300 --> 03:51:08.382
<v Ricky Horton>So as far as getting selected, yeah,
I think we are on the Q3 there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1152-1
03:51:08.382 --> 03:51:14.112
<v Ricky Horton>So I was gonna have four wells in between
the two and the three.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1152-2
03:51:14.112 --> 03:51:17.020
<v Ricky Horton>How much fun it is to build that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1153-0
03:51:26.140 --> 03:51:32.220
<v Ricky Horton>That's the like a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1154-0
03:51:35.620 --> 03:51:47.700
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I said this together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1155-0
03:51:51.060 --> 03:51:59.380
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1162-0
03:52:46.220 --> 03:52:48.380
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1163-0
03:52:52.780 --> 03:52:55.300
<v Ricky Horton>That checked.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1164-0
03:52:58.940 --> 03:53:00.260
<v Ricky Horton>We should.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1165-0
03:53:01.660 --> 03:53:12.980
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want somebody of what is that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1168-0
03:53:30.820 --> 03:53:34.420
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I mean, yeah,
especially when you're working on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1169-0
03:53:37.020 --> 03:53:41.900
<v Ricky Horton>I know I got a call from the vendor
yesterday's Smith right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1169-1
03:53:41.900 --> 03:53:48.300
<v Ricky Horton>They want to redo their whole facility
and want the entire property given their</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1169-2
03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:51.980
<v Ricky Horton>yard.
And they asked if if we can quote being</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1169-3
03:53:51.980 --> 03:53:53.580
<v Ricky Horton>the chief speak for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1170-0
03:53:53.860 --> 03:54:03.140
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm very. OK, I mean,
we used to do this. Let's do that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1171-0
03:54:04.540 --> 03:54:10.542
<v Ricky Horton>All the trades are electrical.
We are fully frigging.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1171-1
03:54:10.542 --> 03:54:15.988
<v Ricky Horton>We can give me the information.
We will be done.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1171-2
03:54:15.988 --> 03:54:21.100
<v Ricky Horton>So we're sending the overall bid
information.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1172-0
03:54:25.100 --> 03:54:30.143
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
for us to make sure because it's local</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1172-1
03:54:30.143 --> 03:54:38.098
<v Ricky Horton>that you develop. Yeah, right.
So you know the building for the buying</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1172-2
03:54:38.098 --> 03:54:43.700
<v Ricky Horton>middle building or somebody designing a
building.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1173-0
03:54:45.860 --> 03:54:55.535
<v Ricky Horton>It's something very nice. They don't fail.
They don't say what to go on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1173-1
03:54:55.535 --> 03:54:58.980
<v Ricky Horton>So like there should be a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1174-0
03:55:01.420 --> 03:55:08.619
<v Ricky Horton>That too.
So we got all the best that's have to be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1174-1
03:55:08.619 --> 03:55:15.254
<v Ricky Horton>on.
Are you getting in there for a little bit?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1174-2
03:55:15.254 --> 03:55:18.500
<v Ricky Horton>You know the breakfast.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1175-0
03:55:21.180 --> 03:55:27.150
<v Ricky Horton>That's no difference.
That's I shouldn't have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1175-1
03:55:27.150 --> 03:55:36.929
<v Ricky Horton>I've only played once for a long time.
First they expanded the bean markets.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1175-2
03:55:36.929 --> 03:55:38.580
<v Ricky Horton>Now they are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1176-0
03:55:38.860 --> 03:55:41.707
<v Ricky Horton>So they have,
they have one project and there are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1176-1
03:55:41.707 --> 03:55:43.300
<v Ricky Horton>multiple projects they have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1177-0
03:55:44.860 --> 03:55:53.441
<v Ricky Horton>One Kasma was a 50 foot bed,
so at that they have a secondary yard</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1177-1
03:55:53.441 --> 03:56:01.380
<v Ricky Horton>that has 260 foot tables and they also
are obviously clients.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1178-0
03:56:01.780 --> 03:56:08.220
<v Ricky Horton>Well, so oh, the line is long. Uh, Delta,
Bartsman and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1179-0
03:56:09.180 --> 03:56:14.961
<v Ricky Horton>So now Delta bought the lines,
so now Delta owns all of it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1179-1
03:56:14.961 --> 03:56:22.670
<v Ricky Horton>which is why they're trying to completely
redo the facility here off of 30 bit,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1179-2
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:24.500
<v Ricky Horton>whatever it is, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1180-0
03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:28.195
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
what I would like about the doctor</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1180-1
03:56:28.195 --> 03:56:35.106
<v Ricky Horton>facility is you could literally take it
for take coil and give me what I want and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1180-2
03:56:35.106 --> 03:56:39.150
<v Ricky Horton>cut it.
Nobody can do that so I can get cuts of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1180-3
03:56:39.150 --> 03:56:39.740
<v Ricky Horton>length.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1181-0
03:56:39.820 --> 03:56:44.404
<v Ricky Horton>It's nice. Yeah,
that's they they've been doing pretty</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1181-1
03:56:44.404 --> 03:56:49.320
<v Ricky Horton>well for everything,
every far more requests they do them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1181-2
03:56:49.320 --> 03:56:55.820
<v Ricky Horton>Even the one in the quarter police said
do a special no one for all of those.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1182-0
03:56:56.140 --> 03:57:01.727
<v Ricky Horton>They brought everything in.
That would be when I first started in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1182-1
03:57:01.727 --> 03:57:08.498
<v Ricky Horton>Tucson and we use them on this period,
but it would be only for the small, say,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1182-2
03:57:08.498 --> 03:57:11.460
<v Ricky Horton>you know, half a truck or whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1183-0
03:57:11.780 --> 03:57:12.860
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1184-0
03:57:18.020 --> 03:57:22.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, that'll build.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1185-0
03:57:23.980 --> 03:57:30.855
<v Ricky Horton>So and then they have a they have aborted
on the premises and they'll they'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1185-1
03:57:30.855 --> 03:57:34.380
<v Ricky Horton>double replace right off the machine so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1186-0
03:57:35.900 --> 03:57:36.060
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1187-0
03:57:40.460 --> 03:57:45.877
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty soon these service centers are
going to be the people doing the beam</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1187-1
03:57:45.877 --> 03:57:49.726
<v Ricky Horton>line stuff. Yeah, you know,
they they could be, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1187-2
03:57:49.726 --> 03:57:54.929
<v Ricky Horton>So I have it in the mine board. Well,
the person was going to put a pipe</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1187-3
03:57:54.929 --> 03:57:57.780
<v Ricky Horton>process processing center in right here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1188-0
03:57:57.980 --> 03:58:01.340
<v Ricky Horton>Across the highway,
just a little bit more.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1189-0
03:58:02.620 --> 03:58:13.399
<v Ricky Horton>And I got the land and everything.
I got a super center right next to it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1189-1
03:58:13.399 --> 03:58:16.020
<v Ricky Horton>I'll go ahead and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1190-0
03:58:17.260 --> 03:58:23.373
<v Ricky Horton>So you have to get the five processing
done in elevators, which sucks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1190-1
03:58:23.373 --> 03:58:30.260
<v Ricky Horton>It's those Houston shops that use those
service centers to bring in everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1191-0
03:58:31.340 --> 03:58:34.100
<v Ricky Horton>Partially finished.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1192-0
03:58:41.820 --> 03:58:45.990
<v Ricky Horton>You're sending me,
I think all those service centers,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1192-1
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:49.465
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
one company that bought us service</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1192-2
03:58:49.465 --> 03:58:54.020
<v Ricky Horton>centers, they wanted to go, yeah,
that's really what they.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1193-0
03:58:56.140 --> 03:59:01.532
<v Ricky Horton>I will be Ben Clips, plasma captives.
I can just see it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1193-1
03:59:01.532 --> 03:59:08.343
<v Ricky Horton>I'm climbing up and up and up.
These days they're going to just have 5B</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1193-2
03:59:08.343 --> 03:59:11.180
<v Ricky Horton>months there and just be here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1194-0
03:59:14.380 --> 03:59:18.350
<v Ricky Horton>Possible.
It'll be interesting to see if we were</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1194-1
03:59:18.350 --> 03:59:23.777
<v Ricky Horton>standing. Yeah, it's horrible.
This is where you guys think it got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1194-2
03:59:23.777 --> 03:59:28.799
<v Ricky Horton>killed this year on terrorists.
I'm sure they know very much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1194-3
03:59:28.799 --> 03:59:30.500
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see how much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1195-0
03:59:30.540 --> 03:59:36.780
<v Ricky Horton>Make a pass through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1197-0
03:59:41.100 --> 03:59:46.572
<v Ricky Horton>The price of yield in Mexico is quite
cheaper than here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1197-1
03:59:46.572 --> 03:59:51.756
<v Ricky Horton>We were buying for our shop in Mexico,
out of Mexico,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1197-2
03:59:51.756 --> 03:59:57.420
<v Ricky Horton>you know it's 15 to 20% cheaper and
you're bringing it in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1198-0
03:59:57.900 --> 04:00:09.140
<v Ricky Horton>We would bring in trucks from Monterey,
so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1199-0
04:00:10.540 --> 04:00:13.460
<v Ricky Horton>In the sound of people just seeing all
those.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1200-0
04:00:14.220 --> 04:00:20.506
<v Ricky Horton>In the States, we have a shop in Mexico,
Mexico, Mexico,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1200-1
04:00:20.506 --> 04:00:26.020
<v Ricky Horton>and then the manufacturers will be coming
across.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1201-0
04:00:27.100 --> 04:00:31.020
<v Ricky Horton>Let's just say we got good at it.
It certainly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1202-0
04:00:31.980 --> 04:00:36.381
<v Ricky Horton>No, you can have more, right?
You can kind of polish it if you got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1202-1
04:00:36.381 --> 04:00:41.110
<v Ricky Horton>typically four people to deal with,
two on this side, two on that side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1202-2
04:00:41.110 --> 04:00:43.540
<v Ricky Horton>but they all have to be on the money.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1203-0
04:00:45.020 --> 04:00:50.755
<v Ricky Horton>But so, you know, once we worked it out,
it worked. It was all inside business,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1203-1
04:00:50.755 --> 04:00:52.260
<v Ricky Horton>so it was all inside.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1204-0
04:00:53.260 --> 04:00:58.340
<v Ricky Horton>It's like,
that's how the US ever competes with this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1205-0
04:00:59.380 --> 04:01:00.420
<v Ricky Horton>Let me tell you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1206-0
04:01:04.980 --> 04:01:08.180
<v Ricky Horton>Share with the rest of the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1207-0
04:01:10.380 --> 04:01:16.100
<v Ricky Horton>20 years now, so factories, India, China.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1208-0
04:01:17.900 --> 04:01:24.100
<v Ricky Horton>Possible to continue? Yeah,
we're just got much lower.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1209-0
04:01:25.340 --> 04:01:32.140
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, laborers must think it's free,
but it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1210-0
04:01:33.660 --> 04:01:37.460
<v Ricky Horton>Chatter didn't start packing down for
2017.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1211-0
04:01:40.460 --> 04:01:44.332
<v Ricky Horton>You can actually do that after that.
It would probably work, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1211-1
04:01:44.332 --> 04:01:48.089
<v Ricky Horton>Was it that way around?
I thought they got, um, for the year. No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1211-2
04:01:48.089 --> 04:01:52.131
<v Ricky Horton>let's try everything right now.
I was gonna try it out for a period of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1211-3
04:01:52.131 --> 04:01:52.700
<v Ricky Horton>time, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1212-0
04:01:53.020 --> 04:01:53.180
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1213-0
04:01:53.940 --> 04:01:58.198
<v Ricky Horton>They went,
they went so far like we had to do before</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1213-1
04:01:58.198 --> 04:02:04.303
<v Ricky Horton>we're using frost into the bushes like
all the bushes were like from bumper</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1213-2
04:02:04.303 --> 04:02:10.890

04:11:22.982 --> 04:11:26.700

04:12:04.740 --> 04:12:20.660
<v Ricky Horton>No, that's probably about to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1278-0
04:12:20.700 --> 04:12:28.250

<v Ricky Horton>You're in this particularly an hour.
I use that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1281-0

04:13:42.860 --> 04:13:53.515
<v Ricky Horton>It was a lot closer than I started,
actually. I thought, I think we did it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1290-1
04:13:53.515 --> 04:13:57.580

04:13:59.220 --> 04:14:02.300
<v Ricky Horton>No, you didn't give me, uh, basically.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1292-0
04:14:03.340 --> 04:14:07.831
<v Ricky Horton>Once I was good,
but there should be a separate one. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1292-1
04:14:07.831 --> 04:14:11.140
<v Ricky Horton>double check that because that's the case.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1293-0
04:14:12.380 --> 04:14:18.169

He might have just started the one on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1293-1
04:14:18.169 --> 04:14:22.781
<v Ricky Horton>there,
but I'm pretty sure he put it somewhere</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1293-2
04:14:22.781 --> 04:14:23.860
<v Ricky Horton>else. Yeah.</v>

<v Ricky Horton>I don't think I estimated it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1299-0
04:14:44.860 --> 04:14:47.780

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1301-0
04:14:52.140 --> 04:14:57.785
<v Ricky Horton>That's the only happy nothing.
You were supposed to push it down here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1301-1
04:14:57.785 --> 04:15:04.479
<v Ricky Horton>that as a change order. Yeah, so I yeah,
I guess I'll just go back and type in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1301-2
04:15:04.479 --> 04:15:07.220
<v Ricky Horton>GX and see what the other two are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1302-0
04:15:09.740 --> 04:15:13.573
<v Ricky Horton>He's still a big one.
He's not understanding. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1302-1
04:15:13.573 --> 04:15:18.585
<v Ricky Horton>because they have both there.
So they do the field portion and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1302-2
04:15:18.585 --> 04:15:22.343
<v Ricky Horton>they have a compatload.
He started the compatload.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1302-3
04:15:22.343 --> 04:15:26.618
<v Ricky Horton>That makes sense.
Don't you guys are responding things in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1302-4
04:15:26.618 --> 04:15:27.060
<v Ricky Horton>there?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1303-0
04:15:27.500 --> 04:15:33.813
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I had 29450 from Steel and then 150150.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1303-1
04:15:33.813 --> 04:15:36.420
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he gave it a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1304-0
04:15:37.940 --> 04:15:44.294
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so he gave you like what?
He gave me the total 31, plus 31,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1304-1
04:15:44.294 --> 04:15:49.589
<v Ricky Horton>some change or whatever my e-mail said.
We're talking,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1304-2
04:15:49.589 --> 04:15:52.380
<v Ricky Horton>we're talking about shipping.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1305-0
04:15:54.460 --> 04:16:00.199
<v Ricky Horton>That's because we can save time by going
to just the one quote and worried about</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1305-1
04:16:00.199 --> 04:16:04.379
<v Ricky Horton>keep getting lost.
Maybe we have three different quotes in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1305-2
04:16:04.379 --> 04:16:08.700
<v Ricky Horton>there, one for the harlot,
one for the drought, one for the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1306-0
04:16:09.860 --> 04:16:11.500
<v Ricky Horton>The clock.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1307-0
04:16:20.580 --> 04:16:26.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1308-0
04:16:29.940 --> 04:16:30.180
<v Ricky Horton>Right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1311-0
04:16:44.460 --> 04:16:46.860
<v Ricky Horton>That's the limit.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1312-0
04:16:51.580 --> 04:16:55.708
<v Ricky Horton>Must be worried.
We'll be in the powers problem.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1312-1
04:16:55.708 --> 04:16:59.920
<v Ricky Horton>What do we have one person in question
and it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1312-2
04:16:59.920 --> 04:17:06.323
<v Ricky Horton>I just think it's a very sort of bridge.
I just saw it clicked on in in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1312-3
04:17:06.323 --> 04:17:08.260
<v Ricky Horton>morning. I just got it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1313-0
04:17:08.700 --> 04:17:13.284
<v Ricky Horton>Till disclaimer.
It'll be sure to spread it yet,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1313-1
04:17:13.284 --> 04:17:14.500
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1314-0
04:17:15.620 --> 04:17:15.660
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1315-0
04:17:17.580 --> 04:17:18.740
<v Ricky Horton>By playing music.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1316-0
04:17:22.620 --> 04:17:27.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1317-0
04:17:28.860 --> 04:17:42.390
<v Ricky Horton>And then she's learning the lab only if
we needed so they don't create much</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1317-1
04:17:42.390 --> 04:17:48.620
<v Ricky Horton>different sheets. I'm really doing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1318-0
04:17:48.860 --> 04:17:54.522
<v Ricky Horton>No, it's probably the more field schools.
Is that one of the problem, John? John?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1318-1
04:17:54.522 --> 04:17:58.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, do you want to go to the drawers?
Yeah, we should have a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1319-0
04:18:01.380 --> 04:18:06.684
<v Ricky Horton>Should we start in the original at least
in close?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1319-1
04:18:06.684 --> 04:18:13.860
<v Ricky Horton>If you're on the down where you want me
to, I should have something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1319-2
04:18:13.860 --> 04:18:15.940
<v Ricky Horton>What are they doing?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1320-0
04:18:16.340 --> 04:18:21.780
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not sure yet. Well,
I mean what I've got here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1323-0
04:18:34.780 --> 04:18:39.105
<v Ricky Horton>They're going to put me on.
They made it something they're going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1323-1
04:18:39.105 --> 04:18:43.747
<v Ricky Horton>put me on the same TJ's on so TJ doesn't
have to do it. So but you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1323-2
04:18:43.747 --> 04:18:46.100
<v Ricky Horton>haven't you looked at that adventure?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1324-0
04:18:48.060 --> 04:18:51.860
<v Ricky Horton>There's not an auto kind of venture for
like, so we had a better.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1325-0
04:18:55.300 --> 04:18:55.460
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1326-0
04:18:56.940 --> 04:19:03.601
<v Ricky Horton>Veteran Solid Works are very similar,
but seemed like a lot more than people</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1326-1
04:19:03.601 --> 04:19:08.878
<v Ricky Horton>who are very solid works,
but we didn't want to keep all the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1326-2
04:19:08.878 --> 04:19:11.300
<v Ricky Horton>licenses, but what sucks is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1327-0
04:19:12.820 --> 04:19:17.755
<v Ricky Horton>Inventors of AutoCAD boxes.
So a lot of the old guys like me were</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1327-1
04:19:17.755 --> 04:19:23.364
<v Ricky Horton>AutoCAD people and so now it became a
problem on how many AutoCAD licenses</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1327-2
04:19:23.364 --> 04:19:29.420
<v Ricky Horton>could be achieved while we were getting
these licenses like we all know started.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1328-0
04:19:29.500 --> 04:19:34.220
<v Ricky Horton>But I mean if you want to do simple lines
like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1329-0
04:19:34.940 --> 04:19:39.540
<v Ricky Horton>But I mean, Inventor is a whole or song.
It's a whole thing tomorrow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1330-0
04:19:41.500 --> 04:19:44.252
<v Ricky Horton>I got.
I haven't entered for a little while and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1330-1
04:19:44.252 --> 04:19:48.436
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like, we need this add on,
we need this add on, we need this add on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1330-2
04:19:48.436 --> 04:19:51.474
<v Ricky Horton>I was like,
it's going to cost a fortune by the time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1330-3
04:19:51.474 --> 04:19:56.002
<v Ricky Horton>it's not like we're redesigning our if
you're going to use it for the field or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1330-4
04:19:56.002 --> 04:19:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>you can.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1331-0
04:19:56.540 --> 04:19:59.576
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they wanted to do it here for the shop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1331-1
04:19:59.576 --> 04:20:04.922
<v Ricky Horton>And I was like, I think that'd be great.
That just sounds what did you draw here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1331-2
04:20:04.922 --> 04:20:10.004
<v Ricky Horton>in the winter because the buildings and
the oh, they actually draw it. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1331-3
04:20:10.004 --> 04:20:13.700
<v Ricky Horton>they who's going to do the home?
They want me to do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1332-0
04:20:14.420 --> 04:20:20.628
<v Ricky Horton>Jimmy had started doing it and there's
just, that's for like, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1332-1
04:20:20.628 --> 04:20:27.354
<v Ricky Horton>real tight manufacturing where you're
really trying to get it processes close</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1332-2
04:20:27.354 --> 04:20:29.940
<v Ricky Horton>together and you're trying to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1333-0
04:20:30.140 --> 04:20:33.820
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, sorry. But I was like,
I don't have time for that either.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1333-1
04:20:33.820 --> 04:20:37.787
<v Ricky Horton>It's a lot. It's not just.
I heard somebody you, you know, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1333-2
04:20:37.787 --> 04:20:42.616
<v Ricky Horton>Upwork. No, it's like a website, you know,
you can just throw a job at somebody and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1333-3
04:20:42.616 --> 04:20:45.260
<v Ricky Horton>it just does this **** all the time.
Exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1334-0
04:20:45.700 --> 04:20:48.433
<v Ricky Horton>And then what we did is for one of the
buildings,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1334-1
04:20:48.433 --> 04:20:52.697
<v Ricky Horton>we did a demo on a building scanner and
so we're all walking around doing the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1334-2
04:20:52.697 --> 04:20:55.594
<v Ricky Horton>training on it and scan and then they
said, Oh yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1334-3
04:20:55.594 --> 04:20:59.858
<v Ricky Horton>we'll send you your file for free,
you know, we're part of the just the demo,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1334-4
04:20:59.858 --> 04:21:01.060
<v Ricky Horton>so that we never were.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1335-0
04:21:01.420 --> 04:21:02.420
<v Ricky Horton>And bottles.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1336-0
04:21:03.500 --> 04:21:12.608
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so I think,
but I have some interest. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1336-1
04:21:12.608 --> 04:21:15.340
<v Ricky Horton>that's the jab.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1337-0
04:21:16.740 --> 04:21:23.810
<v Ricky Horton>But I I have, I have. I'll look at 2011,
the company I work for a bottom of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1337-1
04:21:23.810 --> 04:21:27.963
<v Ricky Horton>disk,
so I haven't had to have it forever now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1337-2
04:21:27.963 --> 04:21:30.260
<v Ricky Horton>but it's it's limited but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1338-0
04:21:32.780 --> 04:21:37.660
<v Ricky Horton>And then I start deals with that software
code.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1339-0
04:21:40.220 --> 04:21:45.500
<v Ricky Horton>Because there's kids that are so good at
it. Exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1340-0
04:21:48.740 --> 04:21:54.464
<v Ricky Horton>So we're going to wait for the electrical?
Should we do your demo?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1340-1
04:21:54.464 --> 04:22:00.018
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't heard something about it.
Must be in that cold though.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1340-2
04:22:00.018 --> 04:22:04.460
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I'm thinking about that.
It's like the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1341-0
04:22:04.540 --> 04:22:08.140
<v Ricky Horton>In a call to see 12:30.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1342-0
04:22:11.260 --> 04:22:15.300
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1343-0
04:22:18.060 --> 04:22:24.260
<v Ricky Horton>And then there's this 15 chicks, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1344-0
04:22:24.300 --> 04:22:24.460
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1345-0
04:22:25.500 --> 04:22:31.057
<v Ricky Horton>I did just a bit on on the one that I did.
I didn't do an estimate of it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1345-1
04:22:31.057 --> 04:22:33.460
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't do the labor. I didn't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1347-0
04:22:36.700 --> 04:22:42.782
<v Ricky Horton>You can't reject that, kid.
Not unless it's 8C. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1347-1
04:22:42.782 --> 04:22:45.260
<v Ricky Horton>that'll work that way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1349-0
04:22:53.180 --> 04:22:56.860
<v Ricky Horton>No, we did not. Uh,
I mean ready for the top model.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1350-0
04:22:58.140 --> 04:23:02.151
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'm just walking in the conference rooms</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1350-1
04:23:02.151 --> 04:23:03.260
<v Ricky Horton>and you just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1352-0
04:23:19.900 --> 04:23:24.220
<v Ricky Horton>I believe it's seeing in the field site,
the other construction site.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1353-0
04:23:27.940 --> 04:23:28.180
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1354-0
04:23:29.940 --> 04:23:31.860
<v Ricky Horton>It's our technology.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1356-0
04:23:42.860 --> 04:23:46.060
<v Ricky Horton>I'm good. Yeah, like you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1357-0
04:23:51.980 --> 04:23:56.660
<v Ricky Horton>I was not that impressed.
I was a little one in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1357-1
04:23:56.660 --> 04:24:00.560
<v Ricky Horton>They get embarrassed.
I think they were bad.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1357-2
04:24:00.560 --> 04:24:05.847
<v Ricky Horton>It's like they thought it was kind of
funny. Well, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1357-3
04:24:05.847 --> 04:24:07.580
<v Ricky Horton>you got to remember.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1358-0
04:24:07.580 --> 04:24:13.033
<v Ricky Horton>Or I've come from other places that have
all this really nice equipment and I go a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1358-1
04:24:13.033 --> 04:24:16.055
<v Ricky Horton>lot of space to do that.
I'm going to use it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1358-2
04:24:16.055 --> 04:24:21.245
<v Ricky Horton>I'm purposely use a really good set of
drawings so you can kind of see what it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1358-3
04:24:21.245 --> 04:24:24.267
<v Ricky Horton>can do.
That's throwing up the most difficult</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1358-4
04:24:24.267 --> 04:24:26.500
<v Ricky Horton>things. See what it can do, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1359-0
04:24:27.700 --> 04:24:27.780
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1360-0
04:24:29.820 --> 04:24:34.727
<v Ricky Horton>They've had this thing.
They've had about 70 fabricators on it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1360-1
04:24:34.727 --> 04:24:39.011
<v Ricky Horton>for about the past six months,
just as a in beta mode,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1360-2
04:24:39.011 --> 04:24:44.151
<v Ricky Horton>just to get things working.
So I'm gonna upload a set of drawings</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1360-3
04:24:44.151 --> 04:24:44.540
<v Ricky Horton>here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1361-0
04:24:46.220 --> 04:24:49.329
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
just put in today's date as a project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1361-1
04:24:49.329 --> 04:24:52.660
<v Ricky Horton>number.
Fill out whatever you want to there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1362-0
04:24:54.620 --> 04:24:57.767
<v Ricky Horton>So it's gonna upload the drawings.
Let me actually,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1362-1
04:24:57.767 --> 04:25:01.820
<v Ricky Horton>let me go open that so you can kind of
see what I'm uploading. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1363-0
04:25:06.060 --> 04:25:06.100
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1364-0
04:25:16.860 --> 04:25:21.604
<v Ricky Horton>So this is what I'm uploading.
Just just PDF, just sub PDFS. Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1364-1
04:25:21.604 --> 04:25:25.198
<v Ricky Horton>And what's good?
What's this program going to do?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1364-2
04:25:25.198 --> 04:25:29.870
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to do magic. It's going to.
So once it gets up there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1364-3
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:34.111
<v Ricky Horton>I'll fill up the analyze PDFS.
It'll take off the columns.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1364-4
04:25:34.111 --> 04:25:35.620
<v Ricky Horton>It'll take off the B.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1365-0
04:25:36.260 --> 04:25:42.578
<v Ricky Horton>Things it'll engineer connections,
it'll spin out the next floor to to bring</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1365-1
04:25:42.578 --> 04:25:47.665
<v Ricky Horton>in the power plant and it'll build the
model all in one shot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1365-2
04:25:47.665 --> 04:25:52.260
<v Ricky Horton>How long have you got to say?
Are you impressive? It's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1366-0
04:25:52.460 --> 04:26:00.031
<v Ricky Horton>Crazy. It's unbelievable. All right,
so I'm in there. Let me go here first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1366-1
04:26:00.031 --> 04:26:08.100
<v Ricky Horton>This configuration. No, it's it's you.
You don't have to upload everything like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1367-0
04:26:08.780 --> 04:26:13.742
<v Ricky Horton>This page is going to do nothing with,
right? Sure. But even with the sections,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1367-1
04:26:13.742 --> 04:26:17.277
<v Ricky Horton>it's not going to really look at the
sections right now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1367-2
04:26:17.277 --> 04:26:22.053
<v Ricky Horton>They're actually working on it where
where we'll start using the sections to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1367-3
04:26:22.053 --> 04:26:24.905
<v Ricky Horton>get more detail and to get other
information.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1367-4
04:26:24.905 --> 04:26:27.820
<v Ricky Horton>But pretty much these are all the pages I
can.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1368-0
04:26:28.460 --> 04:26:32.051
<v Ricky Horton>So now I can write here on this config
page.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1368-1
04:26:32.051 --> 04:26:38.433
<v Ricky Horton>You would wanna go in here and look and
do all your settings for how you wanted</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1368-2
04:26:38.433 --> 04:26:43.220
<v Ricky Horton>to do connections,
the Bman reaction method, seismic stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1369-0
04:26:45.860 --> 04:26:49.912
<v Ricky Horton>Do I want to default to double angles or
shoe tabs? Right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1369-1
04:26:49.912 --> 04:26:53.690
<v Ricky Horton>So you set all this up in order to do the
connections.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1369-2
04:26:53.690 --> 04:26:58.635
<v Ricky Horton>Does it actually understand different
side of the parts of the I'm not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1369-3
04:26:58.635 --> 04:27:04.060
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that I know the full answer
for that to be quite honest with you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1370-0
04:27:04.060 --> 04:27:10.867
<v Ricky Horton>I I haven't you know I haven't used this
in production it's just so I I I don't</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1370-1
04:27:10.867 --> 04:27:17.674
<v Ricky Horton>know all those have to ask them on that
but So what I'm going to do on so I'm a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1370-2
04:27:17.674 --> 04:27:22.609
<v Ricky Horton>foundation plan.
So what I'm going to do it picked up the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1370-3
04:27:22.609 --> 04:27:23.460
<v Ricky Horton>scale and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1371-0
04:27:23.700 --> 04:27:28.523
<v Ricky Horton>the well pick up top of steel because
there is no top of steel, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1371-1
04:27:28.523 --> 04:27:31.986
<v Ricky Horton>So I could do zero,
I could do minus one for that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1371-2
04:27:31.986 --> 04:27:37.556
<v Ricky Horton>I can do whatever I wanted to there for
for this and then I'm going to tell it by</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1371-3
04:27:37.556 --> 04:27:40.340
<v Ricky Horton>hitting this button to go and analyze it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1372-0
04:27:40.940 --> 04:27:44.425
<v Ricky Horton>So now you'll see that like on this one,
you'll see it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1372-1
04:27:44.425 --> 04:27:49.216
<v Ricky Horton>It'll pick it up here in a second.
See how it is now highlighted in blue and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1372-2
04:27:49.216 --> 04:27:53.323
<v Ricky Horton>has that overlay on it.
At that point I'm just making sure it got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1372-3
04:27:53.323 --> 04:27:58.238
<v Ricky Horton>everything and making sure it didn't get
something that I don't want like this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1372-4
04:27:58.238 --> 04:27:58.860
<v Ricky Horton>over here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1373-0
04:27:59.500 --> 04:28:02.119
<v Ricky Horton>It picked up stuff here which I don't
want,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1373-1
04:28:02.119 --> 04:28:06.822
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm just going to highlight that and
say don't don't do that and tell it to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1373-2
04:28:06.822 --> 04:28:09.500
<v Ricky Horton>rebuild it with that with that out of it
so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1374-0
04:28:10.460 --> 04:28:13.314
<v Ricky Horton>You're pretty much just letting it do its
thing,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1374-1
04:28:13.314 --> 04:28:16.516
<v Ricky Horton>then making sure it got everything and
cleaning it up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1374-2
04:28:16.516 --> 04:28:20.825
<v Ricky Horton>Now if I I'm going to then go to the next
set, it picked up top of steel.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1374-3
04:28:20.825 --> 04:28:24.260
<v Ricky Horton>It picked up my scale,
so I'm just going to tell it to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1375-0
04:28:26.940 --> 04:28:30.992
<v Ricky Horton>And boom, it got all that.
You can see the red though.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1375-1
04:28:30.992 --> 04:28:36.222
<v Ricky Horton>It didn't pick up like if I zoom in here,
it didn't get this one here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1375-2
04:28:36.222 --> 04:28:40.495
<v Ricky Horton>this 10 at 12 and it didn't get this 10
at 12 right here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1375-3
04:28:40.495 --> 04:28:43.220
<v Ricky Horton>So if I were to select both of those.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1376-0
04:28:44.940 --> 04:28:49.940
<v Ricky Horton>I can then tell that it's a dead whoops W
10 by 12.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1377-0
04:28:52.820 --> 04:28:56.260
<v Ricky Horton>And that it has six studs.
It is picking up the studs, by the way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1378-0
04:28:58.300 --> 04:29:03.157
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm saving that, telling it to rebuild.
So really, I'm just cleaning it up, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1378-1
04:29:03.157 --> 04:29:07.506
<v Ricky Horton>Like I picked up all this crap right here
thinking it's a beam of some sort.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1378-2
04:29:07.506 --> 04:29:12.081
<v Ricky Horton>So I would just be going through cleaning
all that up. I'll go to the next page.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1378-3
04:29:12.081 --> 04:29:16.260
<v Ricky Horton>Same deal picked up top of steel and my
scale. I'll just tell it to scan.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1379-0
04:29:18.540 --> 04:29:22.500
<v Ricky Horton>I see you're going floor by elevation by
elevation, correct?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1380-0
04:29:27.980 --> 04:29:31.235
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
I haven't really cleaned up anything,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1380-1
04:29:31.235 --> 04:29:35.391
<v Ricky Horton>right? But just a few, a few things.
But as I'm doing that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1380-2
04:29:35.391 --> 04:29:40.100
<v Ricky Horton>if I go here to my 3D view,
you're gonna see this building a model.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1381-0
04:29:45.140 --> 04:29:50.340
<v Ricky Horton>This is where I think modeling is going
to be a thing of the past before too long.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1382-0
04:29:57.300 --> 04:30:01.300
<v Ricky Horton>And so now I've got my model with
connections in it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1383-0
04:30:04.580 --> 04:30:09.500
<v Ricky Horton>Hmm. Interesting. Isn't that crazy? Yeah,
it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1384-0
04:30:12.300 --> 04:30:17.373
<v Ricky Horton>Absolutely, I believe.
So I I got my bottle.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1384-1
04:30:17.373 --> 04:30:23.799
<v Ricky Horton>I can come over here,
but you see that bill of material.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1384-2
04:30:23.799 --> 04:30:28.420
<v Ricky Horton>This is actually the the import template.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1385-0
04:30:28.860 --> 04:30:33.427
<v Ricky Horton>For technical power fab.
So you can see that it's it's picked up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1385-1
04:30:33.427 --> 04:30:39.468
<v Ricky Horton>my quality, my shape, my size, the length,
the grade. It's got my labor code in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1385-2
04:30:39.468 --> 04:30:44.948
<v Ricky Horton>They're they're working on this being
customizable to your own labor codes if</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1385-3
04:30:44.948 --> 04:30:45.580
<v Ricky Horton>you want.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1386-0
04:30:45.980 --> 04:30:56.340
<v Ricky Horton>It got camber coat holes, studs. I mean,
it's just picking up everything, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1387-0
04:30:58.780 --> 04:31:02.257
<v Ricky Horton>They would find it a whole lot.
We've met one of yours,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1387-1
04:31:02.257 --> 04:31:05.921
<v Ricky Horton>not growing up here,
but that's that's one thing that they</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1387-2
04:31:05.921 --> 04:31:11.260
<v Ricky Horton>wanted all these fabricators on there for.
They're like, hey, go on there, it's free.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1388-0
04:31:12.620 --> 04:31:23.516
<v Ricky Horton>Now I can come here also with my columns.
You see that it thought that it thought</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1388-1
04:31:23.516 --> 04:31:32.020
<v Ricky Horton>that on the upper level it was a 14 to 74,
but it's a 14 to 68.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-0
04:31:32.540 --> 04:31:35.295
<v Ricky Horton>Actually,
so I will change this to a 14 at 60.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-1
04:31:35.295 --> 04:31:39.809
<v Ricky Horton>So what it did, it put a splice in there.
That's what that is. Put a splice,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-2
04:31:39.809 --> 04:31:42.799
<v Ricky Horton>I won't get rid of it.
So now I've got that fixed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-3
04:31:42.799 --> 04:31:45.612
<v Ricky Horton>So you want to check your column schedule
here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-4
04:31:45.612 --> 04:31:48.836
<v Ricky Horton>But like if I literally did want a column
splice here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1389-5
04:31:48.836 --> 04:31:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>I can do that and then choose whether I
want it to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1390-0
04:31:52.060 --> 04:31:57.104
<v Ricky Horton>Be welded or bolted or what type of
connect splice I want there, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1390-1
04:31:57.104 --> 04:32:02.778
<v Ricky Horton>So I can build. This was a client of mine,
so it's a fabricator that wrote this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1390-2
04:32:02.778 --> 04:32:06.980
<v Ricky Horton>which is another big check box, right?
That's a good thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1391-0
04:32:07.180 --> 04:32:13.620
<v Ricky Horton>A firework behavior like this.
So it's pretty awesome, isn't it? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1392-0
04:32:14.780 --> 04:32:18.216
<v Ricky Horton>I can also right here,
they're going to get it set.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1392-1
04:32:18.216 --> 04:32:21.982
<v Ricky Horton>Let me apply that.
They're going to get it set where the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1392-2
04:32:21.982 --> 04:32:27.202
<v Ricky Horton>bracing just it figures the bracing out
and does it. If I get a braces though,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1392-3
04:32:27.202 --> 04:32:31.365
<v Ricky Horton>I can't build my bracing in here if I
wanted to by saying hey,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1392-4
04:32:31.365 --> 04:32:32.620
<v Ricky Horton>start at column C1.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1393-0
04:32:32.660 --> 04:32:41.532
<v Ricky Horton>C1 go to column C32. I want V bracing.
I want it to be welded to cool and I want</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1393-1
04:32:41.532 --> 04:32:46.460
<v Ricky Horton>it to be HSS 8 by 8 by I don't know
quarter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1394-0
04:32:49.100 --> 04:32:49.300
<v Ricky Horton>Wow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1395-0
04:32:51.140 --> 04:32:52.460
<v Ricky Horton>Freaked out on me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1396-0
04:32:59.060 --> 04:33:02.470
<v Ricky Horton>Oh man, you're bad.
Something freaked out on me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1396-1
04:33:02.470 --> 04:33:07.758
<v Ricky Horton>Let me get back in there. But I can.
I can build my bracing if I wanted to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1396-2
04:33:07.758 --> 04:33:13.185
<v Ricky Horton>Then once I get all that done and I have
the model, I could import the model.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1396-3
04:33:13.185 --> 04:33:16.663
<v Ricky Horton>I can also by by getting the the IFC
right there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1396-4
04:33:16.663 --> 04:33:18.820
<v Ricky Horton>They're building it so that it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1398-0
04:33:18.900 --> 04:33:24.422
<v Ricky Horton>You can go straight into tech
construction or SDS too as well and and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1398-1
04:33:24.422 --> 04:33:30.180
<v Ricky Horton>just build the model in there.
But I can also do this export as PDF and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1399-0
04:33:31.060 --> 04:33:36.331
<v Ricky Horton>It marks up everything that it took off.
Now I can go do the rest of the junk,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1399-1
04:33:36.331 --> 04:33:40.200
<v Ricky Horton>you know, the gingerbread stuff,
all the perimeter stuff,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1399-2
04:33:40.200 --> 04:33:44.870
<v Ricky Horton>my miscellaneous and everything.
So I mean, yeah, you think about it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1399-3
04:33:44.870 --> 04:33:48.139
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, how,
how much savings is is that if it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1399-4
04:33:48.139 --> 04:33:50.140
<v Ricky Horton>picking up the drawing, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1400-0
04:33:50.580 --> 04:33:56.573
<v Ricky Horton>I've got, um,
one client in Texas who was if you go to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1400-1
04:33:56.573 --> 04:33:56.900
<v Ricky Horton>um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1401-0
04:33:57.860 --> 04:34:02.241
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, what's her name? The other guy.
The other guy is here. Lyft.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1401-1
04:34:02.241 --> 04:34:06.622
<v Ricky Horton>If you go to these guys website,
you're gonna see a sketch deck.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1401-2
04:34:06.622 --> 04:34:10.801
<v Ricky Horton>You're gonna see one of my clients is the
biggest user of it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1401-3
04:34:10.801 --> 04:34:12.620
<v Ricky Horton>They searched over the his.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1402-0
04:34:12.940 --> 04:34:19.731
<v Ricky Horton>And he he says that he's getting about
40% more estimates out what is moving on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1402-1
04:34:19.731 --> 04:34:24.314
<v Ricky Horton>the same people.
So they're straight structure. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1402-2
04:34:24.314 --> 04:34:30.340
<v Ricky Horton>industrial drugs don't need, yeah,
but like straight structural stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1403-0
04:34:30.660 --> 04:34:35.010
<v Ricky Horton>That's what this guy.
What percentage of what you guys do is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1403-1
04:34:35.010 --> 04:34:35.580
<v Ricky Horton>strange.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1404-0
04:34:38.700 --> 04:34:40.740
<v Ricky Horton>10 percent, 50%.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1405-0
04:34:46.700 --> 04:34:50.989
<v Ricky Horton>Everything on depends. Well,
so that's last question this way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1405-1
04:34:50.989 --> 04:34:54.460
<v Ricky Horton>I'll ask them just to do the restoration
function.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1407-0
04:35:01.380 --> 04:35:05.070
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well, I mean,
we can throw a set of your plans. I what?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1407-1
04:35:05.070 --> 04:35:08.462
<v Ricky Horton>Let me read it right to you.
I don't care if you use it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1407-2
04:35:08.462 --> 04:35:12.270
<v Ricky Horton>I get nothing with you.
I just like to show the tools that I'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1407-3
04:35:12.270 --> 04:35:17.269
<v Ricky Horton>see if it'll be back to just for the day.
How do you know how much it's going to be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1407-4
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:18.340
<v Ricky Horton>when they come up?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1408-0
04:35:18.420 --> 04:35:23.814
<v Ricky Horton>It's they'll be settled in January 1st.
So like right now that that we talked two</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1408-1
04:35:23.814 --> 04:35:27.367
<v Ricky Horton>months ago,
you'd be able to do this for free as long</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1408-2
04:35:27.367 --> 04:35:30.590
<v Ricky Horton>as you get feedback. But yeah,
come January 1st,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1408-3
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:33.616
<v Ricky Horton>it's they're not taking any more beta
people.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1408-4
04:35:33.616 --> 04:35:38.220
<v Ricky Horton>So but I have no idea what it would cost.
They know what sketch that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1409-0
04:35:38.380 --> 04:35:43.966
<v Ricky Horton>So I would imagine it's going to be at
least on sketch deck. So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1409-1
04:35:43.966 --> 04:35:49.710
<v Ricky Horton>which was pretty expensive, but yeah,
it was pretty expensive, $80,000,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1409-2
04:35:49.710 --> 04:35:53.460
<v Ricky Horton>I've heard all over the place for sketch
deck.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1410-0
04:35:54.420 --> 04:35:59.082
<v Ricky Horton>They were doing it the revenue-based
while kind of like Perthest was going for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1410-1
04:35:59.082 --> 04:36:01.973
<v Ricky Horton>a while,
then they stopped that and they started</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1410-2
04:36:01.973 --> 04:36:05.632
<v Ricky Horton>doing it per license,
then they started doing it per company,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1410-3
04:36:05.632 --> 04:36:10.293
<v Ricky Horton>then they started doing it per estimate.
I I don't know how you're going to be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1410-4
04:36:10.293 --> 04:36:11.060
<v Ricky Horton>quite honest.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1411-0
04:36:11.540 --> 04:36:14.300
<v Ricky Horton>So, but it was pretty expensive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1412-0
04:36:17.860 --> 04:36:23.540
<v Ricky Horton>I was here with $25,
000 in licensure should remember.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1413-0
04:36:24.740 --> 04:36:29.502
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, I don't know that. It seems cheap.
Probably licensing subscription. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1413-1
04:36:29.502 --> 04:36:31.700
<v Ricky Horton>it wasn't licensed. I remember that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1414-0
04:36:33.260 --> 04:36:43.253
<v Ricky Horton>But I guess my thought is if I assume $25,
000, you get that 40% more estimate.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1414-1
04:36:43.253 --> 04:36:52.620
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be I'll be all over. Sure.
This is 25K. It's done. Yeah, I'm tossing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1415-0
04:36:52.980 --> 04:36:59.366
<v Ricky Horton>The way this this happened was they hired
a guy from like Hungary that came in and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1415-1
04:36:59.366 --> 04:37:03.829
<v Ricky Horton>he started detail.
But like he's got a program background</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1415-2
04:37:03.829 --> 04:37:08.060
<v Ricky Horton>and a new background and as he's
estimating he's like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1416-0
04:37:08.420 --> 04:37:12.305
<v Ricky Horton>Guys, I think I can do this better.
Will you let me start working on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1416-1
04:37:12.305 --> 04:37:17.035
<v Ricky Horton>something? So he started working on this.
Then he got some of his buddies from back</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1416-2
04:37:17.035 --> 04:37:20.131
<v Ricky Horton>home that are programmers to start
helping them on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1416-3
04:37:20.131 --> 04:37:23.340
<v Ricky Horton>So they've been working on this for about
two years, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1417-0
04:37:23.780 --> 04:37:29.180
<v Ricky Horton>So, yeah,
it's been actively used in their shop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1417-1
04:37:29.180 --> 04:37:38.180
<v Ricky Horton>citizen. So, yeah, cool concept, right?
Yeah, cool is almost an understatement.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1418-0
04:37:39.020 --> 04:37:42.300
<v Ricky Horton>And I've got Sketchbook.
I haven't tried them in forever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1419-0
04:37:47.540 --> 04:37:52.900
<v Ricky Horton>I could throw one up there too,
but there's it doesn't do as much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1420-0
04:37:54.900 --> 04:37:56.860
<v Ricky Horton>So doing that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1421-0
04:38:01.020 --> 04:38:01.700
<v Ricky Horton>So cool.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1422-0
04:38:14.140 --> 04:38:20.136
<v Ricky Horton>I would be to try the girls to see how
much they've advanced it cause I've done</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1422-1
04:38:20.136 --> 04:38:24.782
<v Ricky Horton>some and it's like OK,
well they've had estimators on it here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1422-2
04:38:24.782 --> 04:38:30.927
<v Ricky Horton>like that. I don't know that they got it.
They had to fix too much of that like I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1422-3
04:38:30.927 --> 04:38:33.700
<v Ricky Horton>had a set of drawings I put up there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1423-0
04:38:33.700 --> 04:38:37.010
<v Ricky Horton>They're for a client and they really need
to and it it should.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1423-1
04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:40.215
<v Ricky Horton>Arkansas sent it to them and I got back
through and said OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1423-2
04:38:40.215 --> 04:38:42.527
<v Ricky Horton>you're trying to mail picked up
everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1423-3
04:38:42.527 --> 04:38:46.626
<v Ricky Horton>So I was kind of pleased with their
response right by their crowdsource agent</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1423-4
04:38:46.626 --> 04:38:49.620
<v Ricky Horton>and they can test about a bunch of
different components.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1424-0
04:38:49.740 --> 04:38:52.678
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, exactly.
When I saw it nine months ago, I'm like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1424-1
04:38:52.678 --> 04:38:56.455
<v Ricky Horton>guys, you got to sell this now.
They're like, it's not ready. I'm like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1424-2
04:38:56.455 --> 04:39:00.599
<v Ricky Horton>you're way farther than anybody else.
Just tell everybody what they can do and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1424-3
04:39:00.599 --> 04:39:03.380
<v Ricky Horton>what's needed and just go sell it.
And they're like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1424-4
04:39:03.380 --> 04:39:05.740
<v Ricky Horton>we're not going until it's until it's
ready.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1425-0
04:39:06.700 --> 04:39:07.860
<v Ricky Horton>My OK but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1426-0
04:39:10.540 --> 04:39:12.540
<v Ricky Horton>They're doing it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1433-0
04:39:54.220 --> 04:39:59.140
<v Ricky Horton>Actually,
so I'll grab those and I will try.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1446-0
04:41:09.180 --> 04:41:11.060
<v Ricky Horton>Where do they present their software?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1447-0
04:41:13.100 --> 04:41:16.712
<v Ricky Horton>Do what they go to a place that where
they going to accept it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1447-1
04:41:16.712 --> 04:41:20.438
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think they've gone anywhere yet
to to add any shade yet.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1447-2
04:41:20.438 --> 04:41:23.706
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure they will once they start
selling it, but yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1447-3
04:41:23.706 --> 04:41:25.540
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think they already have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1456-0
04:42:25.740 --> 04:42:26.300
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1457-0
04:42:29.620 --> 04:42:31.940
<v Ricky Horton>So you're not having.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1458-0
04:42:33.140 --> 04:42:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the music.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1459-0
04:42:35.620 --> 04:42:40.397
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they're YouTube videos. Cool.
That's what you were gonna show, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1459-1
04:42:40.397 --> 04:42:41.340
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1460-0
04:42:46.940 --> 04:42:50.540
<v Ricky Horton>This set of drawings I'm looking at right
here has um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1462-0
04:42:53.780 --> 04:42:58.671
<v Ricky Horton>Where the building you got half the
building on this one sheet have to build</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1462-1
04:42:58.671 --> 04:43:02.799
<v Ricky Horton>on this other sheets now has to pile
those two together somehow.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1462-2
04:43:02.799 --> 04:43:07.625
<v Ricky Horton>They're in trouble with that at first,
but they they got that taken care of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1462-3
04:43:07.625 --> 04:43:08.260
<v Ricky Horton>evidently.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1463-0
04:43:10.580 --> 04:43:13.692
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
we're hoping to put down our meeting on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1463-1
04:43:13.692 --> 04:43:16.873
<v Ricky Horton>this.
This is what we really just need to let</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1463-2
04:43:16.873 --> 04:43:18.740
<v Ricky Horton>people take a peek at this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1464-0
04:43:20.820 --> 04:43:25.340
<v Ricky Horton>I like Jimmy was just getting us in an
instant, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1469-0
04:43:54.820 --> 04:44:02.260
<v Ricky Horton>There is a way also to actually draw
stuff on here if you want me to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1470-0
04:44:04.340 --> 04:44:07.060
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know how to do that.
There's someone.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1473-0
04:44:19.940 --> 04:44:21.860
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody's called EME.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1474-0
04:44:22.940 --> 04:44:22.980
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1475-0
04:44:25.620 --> 04:44:32.571
<v Ricky Horton>You mean the company that owns Steel GD?
Master Steel is the is the steel company,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1475-1
04:44:32.571 --> 04:44:37.260
<v Ricky Horton>but they kind of formed their own company
to sell this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1480-0
04:44:57.180 --> 04:45:04.510
<v Ricky Horton>So there is a company called DNV that
does conceptual model of the analysis</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1480-1
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:07.500
<v Ricky Horton>with student structures. Hello.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1481-0
04:45:13.540 --> 04:45:13.820
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1482-0
04:45:19.740 --> 04:45:23.471
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
I think when I searched for Steel Genie,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1482-1
04:45:23.471 --> 04:45:24.900
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, this came up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1483-0
04:45:27.700 --> 04:45:32.189
<v Ricky Horton>There is another trying to think of a
name.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1483-1
04:45:32.189 --> 04:45:36.780
<v Ricky Horton>There's another one that I had a a login
to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1484-0
04:45:38.660 --> 04:45:44.352
<v Ricky Horton>There's search game with infra bells
trying to think of the name of the but</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1484-1
04:45:44.352 --> 04:45:45.100
<v Ricky Horton>it's just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1485-0
04:45:46.180 --> 04:45:51.313
<v Ricky Horton>It's a little bit frustrating because you
you upload the drones to their site,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1485-1
04:45:51.313 --> 04:45:55.277
<v Ricky Horton>they do the take off,
they do the take off of their software</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1485-2
04:45:55.277 --> 04:45:58.980
<v Ricky Horton>and send it back to you.
You have no control over it so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1486-0
04:46:00.100 --> 04:46:04.193
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's a little bit.
It will be a little bit frustrating to me</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1486-1
04:46:04.193 --> 04:46:07.356
<v Ricky Horton>just because I don't.
I got to get it through now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1486-2
04:46:07.356 --> 04:46:10.580
<v Ricky Horton>pick out everything,
manually type it in somewhere.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1487-0
04:46:12.860 --> 04:46:16.620
<v Ricky Horton>Kind of weird that in a YouTube video
they built.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1488-0
04:46:23.780 --> 04:46:26.734
<v Ricky Horton>It's like nothing about contact
information.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1488-1
04:46:26.734 --> 04:46:28.900
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe they just posted the video.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1503-0
04:47:57.260 --> 04:48:02.564
<v Ricky Horton>OK, guys, don't come. What are we doing?
What are we that's left?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1503-1
04:48:02.564 --> 04:48:06.340
<v Ricky Horton>I received the import that we're going to
try.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1504-0
04:48:07.060 --> 04:48:10.917
<v Ricky Horton>I just wanted to do for all these
trapezes. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1504-1
04:48:10.917 --> 04:48:13.540
<v Ricky Horton>I think guys tell me just go here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1505-0
04:48:14.820 --> 04:48:14.860
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1506-0
04:48:16.100 --> 04:48:22.620
<v Ricky Horton>This is on some,
but it just like a regular or something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1507-0
04:48:25.300 --> 04:48:27.740
<v Ricky Horton>Well, mostly that's processed up there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1508-0
04:48:29.420 --> 04:48:38.145
<v Ricky Horton>You got an import on the electrical stuff,
is that what you're saying?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1508-1
04:48:38.145 --> 04:48:46.500
<v Ricky Horton>It was Mike Williams. I was just,
I was just e-mailing Battle Born.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1509-0
04:48:47.340 --> 04:48:50.797
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah, yeah,
that we we helped them with estimating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1509-1
04:48:50.797 --> 04:48:55.197
<v Ricky Horton>They're wanting to help with,
they're wanting to help with production</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1509-2
04:48:55.197 --> 04:48:55.700
<v Ricky Horton>control.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1510-0
04:48:56.660 --> 04:49:00.785
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
they're clean mayor from the council.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1510-1
04:49:00.785 --> 04:49:06.221
<v Ricky Horton>They do structural, they do cranes,
and they do all that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1510-2
04:49:06.221 --> 04:49:09.220
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know anything with them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1511-0
04:49:11.220 --> 04:49:16.140
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks to work started the start for
division about better still.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1512-0
04:49:17.380 --> 04:49:18.580
<v Ricky Horton>There's a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1513-0
04:49:20.580 --> 04:49:26.107
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of other companies out there I
haven't done anything with. I'd love to,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1513-1
04:49:26.107 --> 04:49:28.020
<v Ricky Horton>which I'm busy though, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1514-0
04:49:31.900 --> 04:49:35.660
<v Ricky Horton>Are you booked out once ahead of time?
Yeah, I'm booked out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1515-0
04:49:38.140 --> 04:49:41.460
<v Ricky Horton>Into April right now. Yeah. Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1516-0
04:49:46.220 --> 04:49:50.424
<v Ricky Horton>But that's um,
I'm planning one week a month not</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1516-1
04:49:50.424 --> 04:49:54.456
<v Ricky Horton>traveling.
So that's a little bit artificially</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1516-2
04:49:54.456 --> 04:50:00.460
<v Ricky Horton>inflated from where I used to be.
So you live on the road. Yes, I do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1517-0
04:50:00.820 --> 04:50:07.202
<v Ricky Horton>How many people do you have like Jason
that do the same community? Uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1517-1
04:50:07.202 --> 04:50:08.460
<v Ricky Horton>one other guy?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1518-0
04:50:12.180 --> 04:50:16.070
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
there's probably so many structural shops</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1518-1
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:20.850
<v Ricky Horton>and it's just never ending.
It's supposed to be out there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1518-2
04:50:20.850 --> 04:50:25.793
<v Ricky Horton>It's in the US. Yeah.
And I've been to 130. I found like 87.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1518-3
04:50:25.793 --> 04:50:31.140
<v Ricky Horton>I was looking like what the West looked
like. I found 87 of them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1519-0
04:50:31.340 --> 04:50:36.951
<v Ricky Horton>West, not including California,
not including the coast. Most of my,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1519-1
04:50:36.951 --> 04:50:40.853
<v Ricky Horton>it's like most of my clients.
I don't know why,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1519-2
04:50:40.853 --> 04:50:47.033
<v Ricky Horton>but maybe there's more fabricators,
but most of my clients are eastern side</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1519-3
04:50:47.033 --> 04:50:48.740
<v Ricky Horton>of the United States.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1520-0
04:50:48.740 --> 04:50:53.660
<v Ricky Horton>More southern Western,
which I don't know whether it's just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1521-0
04:50:55.060 --> 04:50:57.420
<v Ricky Horton>Um, like there's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1522-0
04:50:58.820 --> 04:51:04.994
<v Ricky Horton>All of the green dots are on the clients,
but you can see that a higher</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1522-1
04:51:04.994 --> 04:51:09.796
<v Ricky Horton>concentration of them over there.
That's a little less.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1522-2
04:51:09.796 --> 04:51:13.740
<v Ricky Horton>So for whatever reason that is,
I don't know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1523-0
04:51:14.140 --> 04:51:14.340
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1524-0
04:51:16.060 --> 04:51:21.790
<v Ricky Horton>I'll refund my skills and let you know
when I'm looking for a job. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1524-1
04:51:21.790 --> 04:51:27.912
<v Ricky Horton>let me that got a change down here.
I'm having to be 3 miles rather than just</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1524-2
04:51:27.912 --> 04:51:31.758
<v Ricky Horton>my other.
I'm looking on like 3 times the sales,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1524-3
04:51:31.758 --> 04:51:32.700
<v Ricky Horton>3 times the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1525-0
04:51:32.980 --> 04:51:37.878
<v Ricky Horton>There's really stuff,
which is exactly what I found one day,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1525-1
04:51:37.878 --> 04:51:43.820
<v Ricky Horton>so I have to figure out this is what I
like to do and I like to schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1526-0
04:51:49.540 --> 04:51:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>Wait a few minutes in the sun here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1527-0
04:51:53.220 --> 04:52:00.745
<v Ricky Horton>I like to feel like I'm helping, you know,
that's the biggest issue for me with work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1527-1
04:52:00.745 --> 04:52:07.030
<v Ricky Horton>over the last, you know, 10 years,
I'll say. That's the biggest issue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1527-2
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:09.420
<v Ricky Horton>I'm being helped, you know?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1528-0
04:52:09.860 --> 04:52:15.127
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I stuck my nose to this 5205 thing.
I was hearing all these different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1528-1
04:52:15.127 --> 04:52:18.176
<v Ricky Horton>opinions and finally I talked to the
field.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1528-2
04:52:18.176 --> 04:52:21.710
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I left this morning to go talk
to them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1528-3
04:52:21.710 --> 04:52:24.620
<v Ricky Horton>It's like everybody just being backed off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1529-0
04:52:25.060 --> 04:52:27.660
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds like got it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1530-0
04:52:29.540 --> 04:52:33.239
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
because there was such a partial story</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1530-1
04:52:33.239 --> 04:52:38.089
<v Ricky Horton>being told by and this guy basically has
to go do the job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1530-2
04:52:38.089 --> 04:52:43.186
<v Ricky Horton>I thought Jimmy was really good guy kind
of driving all this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1530-3
04:52:43.186 --> 04:52:45.980
<v Ricky Horton>but I can see that's not the case.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1531-0
04:52:46.020 --> 04:52:53.340
<v Ricky Horton>So like check,
they must talk to first manager.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1533-0
04:52:54.580 --> 04:52:59.798
<v Ricky Horton>I think he got pulled into it.
It's not really his, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1533-1
04:52:59.798 --> 04:53:04.259
<v Ricky Horton>but there's nobody that's really good at
doing this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1533-2
04:53:04.259 --> 04:53:09.140
<v Ricky Horton>It's a it's an easy job for somebody with
experience, OK?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1534-0
04:53:10.100 --> 04:53:15.136
<v Ricky Horton>Now, when it comes to field direction,
I'm out of my I'm out of my lane.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1534-1
04:53:15.136 --> 04:53:20.724
<v Ricky Horton>The only thing I'm trying to help with is
the welding of the alloy and and but I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1534-2
04:53:20.724 --> 04:53:24.380
<v Ricky Horton>couldn't get anybody to tell me the
welding process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1535-0
04:53:27.780 --> 04:53:31.775
<v Ricky Horton>When you get the super alloys,
there's welding together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1535-1
04:53:31.775 --> 04:53:36.540
<v Ricky Horton>Actually it's asking the corrosion

05:06:26.500 --> 05:06:35.597
<v Ricky Horton>I got the back up.
It's the outing solutions. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1628-1
05:06:35.597 --> 05:06:41.020
<v Ricky Horton>on the charts. Oh, that's that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1629-0
05:06:43.820 --> 05:06:49.900
<v Ricky Horton>Successful in programming electrical
training. It's exciting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1630-0
05:06:51.300 --> 05:06:58.755
<v Ricky Horton>I did have to suddenly modify this file
to add a different column for growing in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1630-1
05:06:58.755 --> 05:07:03.540
<v Ricky Horton>there, but I just imported everybody.
Oh sweet. So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1631-0
05:07:06.660 --> 05:07:13.980
<v Ricky Horton>The keyboard and admin plan is the minute
for this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1632-0
05:07:15.540 --> 05:07:15.660
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1633-0
05:07:17.380 --> 05:07:20.460
<v Ricky Horton>Like, I guess.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1634-0
05:07:21.620 --> 05:07:27.024
<v Ricky Horton>They bring this.
I have what I have to whatever you have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1634-1
05:07:27.024 --> 05:07:28.540
<v Ricky Horton>to your project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1635-0
05:07:29.620 --> 05:07:29.660
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1636-0
05:07:31.220 --> 05:07:36.769
<v Ricky Horton>Sure there's there's definitely different
aspects that you can add in the summary.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1636-1
05:07:36.769 --> 05:07:40.980
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if it's something we can add
as a default though.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1637-0
05:07:42.420 --> 05:07:47.060
<v Ricky Horton>So account, account,
would you do that or would you see?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1638-0
05:07:48.020 --> 05:07:55.475
<v Ricky Horton>But if you're doing 109 hours of graphic
labor, 25% add 25%, so $25 for admin,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1638-1
05:07:55.475 --> 05:08:01.420
<v Ricky Horton>we see what the cost is and then figure
out and add on to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1639-0
05:08:03.060 --> 05:08:05.748
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think it would cost to cover that part.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1639-1
05:08:05.748 --> 05:08:08.380
<v Ricky Horton>You just keep them one by half, I guess,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1640-0
05:08:11.620 --> 05:08:16.565
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
because most of that we factor outside of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1640-1
05:08:16.565 --> 05:08:22.540
<v Ricky Horton>outside of the system. Yeah,
they actually push us there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1641-0
05:08:24.700 --> 05:08:26.540
<v Ricky Horton>Obviously.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1651-0
05:09:30.020 --> 05:09:30.340
<v Ricky Horton>Sons.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1652-0
05:09:31.980 --> 05:09:32.020
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1655-0
05:09:44.060 --> 05:09:45.900
<v Ricky Horton>Do you need to stop?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1656-0
05:09:48.060 --> 05:09:48.140
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1660-0
05:10:12.420 --> 05:10:12.700
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1663-0
05:10:27.300 --> 05:10:30.460
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and then the bonds change.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1665-0
05:10:44.420 --> 05:10:45.580
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, excuse me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1666-0
05:10:50.500 --> 05:10:54.660
<v Ricky Horton>We'll do that or he doesn't want to do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1667-0
05:10:55.980 --> 05:10:57.660
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1670-0
05:11:12.180 --> 05:11:12.420
<v Ricky Horton>1.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1674-0
05:11:31.860 --> 05:11:38.939
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's all you have to do. Yeah,
there was a there's one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1674-1
05:11:38.939 --> 05:11:46.792
<v Ricky Horton>one column that was missing here.
So I I ended up taking his main mark</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1674-2
05:11:46.792 --> 05:11:48.340
<v Ricky Horton>column to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1675-0
05:11:49.260 --> 05:11:55.260
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, everything on important daily bill.
So hopefully we'll definitely have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1677-0
05:11:58.140 --> 05:12:02.660
<v Ricky Horton>In the in the process, targets would be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1678-0
05:12:06.060 --> 05:12:12.737
<v Ricky Horton>Just making sure some of these can.
Let's say yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1678-1
05:12:12.737 --> 05:12:17.580
<v Ricky Horton>quite a few bars that we can in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1679-0
05:12:20.340 --> 05:12:26.780
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
and you do think that I would say you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1679-1
05:12:26.780 --> 05:12:36.440
<v Ricky Horton>could buy all the two further. Yeah,
probably have a little bit less</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1679-2
05:12:36.440 --> 05:12:40.220
<v Ricky Horton>optimization, but at least.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1680-0
05:12:40.340 --> 05:12:43.420
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm sorry, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1681-0
05:12:44.820 --> 05:12:49.277
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, if that was,
that was my process on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1681-1
05:12:49.277 --> 05:12:53.556
<v Ricky Horton>So something like considering we are and
so on,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1681-2
05:12:53.556 --> 05:12:59.260
<v Ricky Horton>I can probably just combine and see it
all the way through all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1682-0
05:13:01.780 --> 05:13:05.660
<v Ricky Horton>So why don't we just run here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1683-0
05:13:07.380 --> 05:13:14.385
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just skip something.
So I think he was working something right</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1683-1
05:13:14.385 --> 05:13:19.020
<v Ricky Horton>now and I guess maybe beginning of the
year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1684-0
05:13:20.420 --> 05:13:25.326
<v Ricky Horton>I thought they were like virtually
waiting for it to feel like can we get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1684-1
05:13:25.326 --> 05:13:29.038
<v Ricky Horton>this done now?
I wouldn't surprise me usually it's it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1684-2
05:13:29.038 --> 05:13:34.540
<v Ricky Horton>kind of part of the second time I played.
You know, make make it seem that way so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1685-0
05:13:37.540 --> 05:13:41.815
<v Ricky Horton>Depending upon how much work you need to
do in the background to get that Excel</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1685-1
05:13:41.815 --> 05:13:44.326
<v Ricky Horton>file,
we'll look at it as whether or not we're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1685-2
05:13:44.326 --> 05:13:46.998
<v Ricky Horton>going to add an actual add benefit to
this. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1685-3
05:13:46.998 --> 05:13:51.379
<v Ricky Horton>I'd love to be looking into those parts
and we don't know what the total quantity</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1685-4
05:13:51.379 --> 05:13:51.860
<v Ricky Horton>here was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1686-0
05:13:52.820 --> 05:13:55.380
<v Ricky Horton>Trying to get all these loaded up without
the cards would be the pain in the ***.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1687-0
05:14:02.900 --> 05:14:06.543
<v Ricky Horton>Or they we think they're doing this by
hand in the other shop,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1687-1
05:14:06.543 --> 05:14:08.220
<v Ricky Horton>just one inside or something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1688-0
05:14:09.620 --> 05:14:13.336
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the other shots made more for the we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1688-1
05:14:13.336 --> 05:14:17.656
<v Ricky Horton>can't send through us,
so it wouldn't make sense.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1688-2
05:14:17.656 --> 05:14:24.308
<v Ricky Horton>We do the processing and suddenly build
their carts, run all that stuff out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1688-3
05:14:24.308 --> 05:14:26.900
<v Ricky Horton>So you just drop parts of the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1689-0
05:14:26.900 --> 05:14:27.580
<v Ricky Horton>See you in one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1690-0
05:14:32.820 --> 05:14:35.060
<v Ricky Horton>So it's a seven dollar display.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1691-0
05:14:36.020 --> 05:14:38.340
<v Ricky Horton>And actually we don't want the separate
even.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1692-0
05:14:42.620 --> 05:14:51.459
<v Ricky Horton>So a couple of guys who stay here and
these are super simple to assemble.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1692-1
05:14:51.459 --> 05:14:59.820
<v Ricky Horton>So this room used to be this room,
the panel shot and used to be and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1693-0
05:15:00.380 --> 05:15:07.608
<v Ricky Horton>What are the words and that whole wall
used to be the roll of the words.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1693-1
05:15:07.608 --> 05:15:14.340
<v Ricky Horton>We installed a new roll of the origin
panel shop fell through this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1694-0
05:15:15.220 --> 05:15:20.831
<v Ricky Horton>It's kind of kind of a silly little facts
you can't do and then and then send it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1694-1
05:15:20.831 --> 05:15:23.740
<v Ricky Horton>into this swapped it back to the door and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1695-0
05:15:25.180 --> 05:15:25.220
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1696-0
05:15:26.580 --> 05:15:37.620
<v Ricky Horton>And that used to be just a closet with
added storage because so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1697-0
05:15:41.300 --> 05:15:48.116
<v Ricky Horton>Starting with Modeler and I own office in
Modeler and then I went to a pretime and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1697-1
05:15:48.116 --> 05:15:52.140
<v Ricky Horton>was there for 3 or 40 years and I was
back here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1698-0
05:15:53.300 --> 05:15:58.740
<v Ricky Horton>You're gonna build an office above the
shop overlooking the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1699-0
05:15:59.700 --> 05:16:05.180
<v Ricky Horton>That was, uh, that was a good idea.
Never left to be on a new stage.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1700-0
05:16:07.660 --> 05:16:08.460
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1701-0
05:16:11.260 --> 05:16:12.540
<v Ricky Horton>See.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1704-0
05:16:32.500 --> 05:16:38.334
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, you're going to see.
You gave me another way to run that last</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1704-1
05:16:38.334 --> 05:16:39.660
<v Ricky Horton>thing. Oh yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1705-0
05:16:41.460 --> 05:16:44.532
<v Ricky Horton>Run,
but I think I think I'd be able to do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1705-1
05:16:44.532 --> 05:16:46.460
<v Ricky Horton>something. I figure it out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1706-0
05:16:47.500 --> 05:16:52.343
<v Ricky Horton>I tried to open it and it didn't work,
but then I opened my computer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1706-1
05:16:52.343 --> 05:16:57.324
<v Ricky Horton>The morning I came out of him and there
was a weird file on the bottom.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1706-2
05:16:57.324 --> 05:17:01.060
<v Ricky Horton>I almost said it was trying to run after
a long time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1707-0
05:17:03.420 --> 05:17:03.580

<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1717-0
05:18:17.980 --> 05:18:30.700
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want bug shell when you put the
shot in your ***, chief or.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1726-0
05:19:23.020 --> 05:19:27.478
<v Ricky Horton>I'm currently going through running
everything through,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1726-1
05:19:27.478 --> 05:19:31.617
<v Ricky Horton>so I did the important creating the cuts
right now,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1726-2
05:19:31.617 --> 05:19:36.472
<v Ricky Horton>combined everything through in the
purchase order speed bid.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1726-3
05:19:36.472 --> 05:19:38.860
<v Ricky Horton>I'm making the cuts right now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1727-0
05:19:39.220 --> 05:19:42.740
<v Ricky Horton>And then we can smell that to me and say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1728-0
05:19:43.460 --> 05:19:47.070
<v Ricky Horton>It's normally good.
Here's all the records documentation</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1728-1
05:19:47.070 --> 05:19:51.755
<v Ricky Horton>required. If this is what you want,
once I do get after the confirmation,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1728-2
05:19:51.755 --> 05:19:56.884
<v Ricky Horton>know that the electrical database portion
is working, then I'll take this exact,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1728-3
05:19:56.884 --> 05:19:59.100
<v Ricky Horton>you know, copy it, put it in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1729-0
05:19:59.460 --> 05:20:07.860
<v Ricky Horton>So that they and you can see it stopped.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1730-0
05:20:10.580 --> 05:20:15.368
<v Ricky Horton>But oh,
I see the home site that we went through</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1730-1
05:20:15.368 --> 05:20:20.936
<v Ricky Horton>here somewhere.
So I didn't think it wasn't going. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1730-2
05:20:20.936 --> 05:20:21.620
<v Ricky Horton>that's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1733-0
05:20:44.540 --> 05:20:50.820
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still very.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1734-0
05:20:55.340 --> 05:20:58.860
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we've gone through it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1735-0
05:21:08.460 --> 05:21:11.980
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1736-0
05:21:15.580 --> 05:21:16.500
<v Ricky Horton>Open this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1737-0
05:21:20.820 --> 05:21:21.100
<v Ricky Horton>Select.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1743-0
05:21:52.860 --> 05:21:53.700
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1746-0
05:22:06.340 --> 05:22:06.900
<v Ricky Horton>List.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1747-0
05:22:12.700 --> 05:22:14.220
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1749-0
05:22:16.220 --> 05:22:21.940
<v Ricky Horton>I think we want them to see if they like
this where they have type of training.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1750-0
05:22:27.260 --> 05:22:31.860
<v Ricky Horton>This statement established for cutting
people.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1755-0
05:23:03.900 --> 05:23:03.940
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1756-0
05:23:11.460 --> 05:23:16.820
<v Ricky Horton>I think too, if I'm not mistaken,
in permissions they help.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1757-0
05:23:18.220 --> 05:23:28.441
<v Ricky Horton>There is. Or maybe it's coming.
You can set somebody's default workshop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1757-1
05:23:28.441 --> 05:23:34.260
<v Ricky Horton>so that they don't see their stuff, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1758-0
05:23:34.820 --> 05:23:37.980
<v Ricky Horton>It might be.
It's not going to be working what it was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1781-0
05:25:47.900 --> 05:25:50.980
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. OK. You know,
we're going on the speed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1783-0
05:25:59.100 --> 05:26:04.900
<v Ricky Horton>Which one of the bed it is? It's OK.
Is the day before young here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1784-0
05:26:10.860 --> 05:26:11.900
<v Ricky Horton>No story.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1786-0
05:26:22.900 --> 05:26:28.435
<v Ricky Horton>And usually, I think,
but usually I'll be someone in the office</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1786-1
05:26:28.435 --> 05:26:29.300
<v Ricky Horton>like it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1787-0
05:26:32.700 --> 05:26:34.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, but there's not one thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1789-0
05:26:41.860 --> 05:26:42.740
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1790-0
05:26:57.900 --> 05:27:04.543
<v Ricky Horton>What type of music I expected me to be
listed? What were you expecting? How?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1790-1
05:27:04.543 --> 05:27:08.769
<v Ricky Horton>How was it was expected at Lake Park?
Lake Park?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1790-2
05:27:08.769 --> 05:27:14.980
<v Ricky Horton>I was at Lake Park even though I only
like old Lake Park. There you go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1791-0
05:27:18.300 --> 05:27:24.264
<v Ricky Horton>We never really knew old country,
new country, EDM.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1791-1
05:27:24.264 --> 05:27:30.342
<v Ricky Horton>There's only two kinds of music. Western.
That's it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1791-2
05:27:30.342 --> 05:27:38.140
<v Ricky Horton>I said I can listen to anything except
jazz. I just don't get jazz.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1792-0
05:27:38.140 --> 05:27:45.418
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, it's just like,
how can I play it as off as possible with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1792-1
05:27:45.418 --> 05:27:50.740
<v Ricky Horton>still maybe consider I still like classic,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1793-0
05:27:54.700 --> 05:28:00.168
<v Ricky Horton>I went to see James Taylor. Oh,
do you at Red Rocks, Denver. I was like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1793-1
05:28:00.168 --> 05:28:03.839
<v Ricky Horton>I heard he'd be so old,
but he felt a good show.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1793-2
05:28:03.839 --> 05:28:09.906
<v Ricky Horton>I saw him last year. He did like 3 songs.
I didn't get a hurricane back in North</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1793-3
05:28:09.906 --> 05:28:10.580
<v Ricky Horton>Carolina.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1794-0
05:28:10.700 --> 05:28:13.969
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
I did a big concert in Charlotte with a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1794-1
05:28:13.969 --> 05:28:17.379
<v Ricky Horton>bunch of big big one.
He was one of them there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1794-2
05:28:17.379 --> 05:28:21.642
<v Ricky Horton>He'd like 30 more. He's, you know,
rarely he is impressive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1794-3
05:28:21.642 --> 05:28:26.260
<v Ricky Horton>I think he's 74 or something. Yeah,
but if they have, it's just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1795-0
05:28:26.700 --> 05:28:28.500
<v Ricky Horton>Really good, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1796-0
05:28:29.700 --> 05:28:40.100
<v Ricky Horton>He's awesome.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1797-0
05:28:42.220 --> 05:28:46.931
<v Ricky Horton>I saw that Eagles last year.
That was really good. I'm really,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1797-1
05:28:46.931 --> 05:28:51.044
<v Ricky Horton>really very bad.
I haven't seen anybody in the spirit.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1797-2
05:28:51.044 --> 05:28:56.278
<v Ricky Horton>You're inside them, right?
We got all these custom ornamental panels,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1797-3
05:28:56.278 --> 05:29:00.540
<v Ricky Horton>metal panels.
The company that I just left, they didn't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1798-0
05:29:01.780 --> 05:29:02.180
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1799-0
05:29:03.340 --> 05:29:08.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'd like to go in there.
I haven't did it myself. It's a uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1800-0
05:29:09.500 --> 05:29:17.220
<v Ricky Horton>It's a production, you know, it's, I mean,
my daughter's a responsive.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1801-0
05:29:20.940 --> 05:29:25.832
<v Ricky Horton>They won't let you stand there in the
concert because they're afraid you're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1801-1
05:29:25.832 --> 05:29:29.371
<v Ricky Horton>going to fall over.
So you have to sit in the concert.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1801-2
05:29:29.371 --> 05:29:34.005
<v Ricky Horton>It's great. You know, Vince, he'll say it.
He hates playing. He's like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1801-3
05:29:34.005 --> 05:29:39.540
<v Ricky Horton>I've never been ignored by so many people,
because I said looking up and watching me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1802-0
05:29:39.820 --> 05:29:41.940
<v Ricky Horton>And that should be OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1803-0
05:29:46.740 --> 05:29:51.282
<v Ricky Horton>You're getting all these dumped into here
from the electrical side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1803-1
05:29:51.282 --> 05:29:55.824
<v Ricky Horton>so that we can use it to estimate that
project with that thing. No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1803-2
05:29:55.824 --> 05:29:59.498
<v Ricky Horton>it's for processing.
I think it's just for processing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1803-3
05:29:59.498 --> 05:30:00.900
<v Ricky Horton>I don't take any. OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1804-0
05:30:02.540 --> 05:30:08.420
<v Ricky Horton>If all that was set up because we're
purchasing that and for nesting, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1805-0
05:30:11.100 --> 05:30:14.460
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure it's the best thing part that he
really wants to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1806-0
05:30:24.220 --> 05:30:29.195
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I'm surprised that he wasn't
going to just ruin it here when the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1806-1
05:30:29.195 --> 05:30:31.420
<v Ricky Horton>jacket we were losing power cloud.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1807-0
05:30:38.460 --> 05:30:38.580
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1808-0
05:30:46.620 --> 05:30:47.860
<v Ricky Horton>Once I'm done with the text count.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1809-0
05:30:52.700 --> 05:31:05.340
<v Ricky Horton>857 assemblies and 2571 parts and that's
rods in industry, yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1810-0
05:31:05.420 --> 05:31:06.620
<v Ricky Horton>It snap.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1812-0
05:31:11.540 --> 05:31:19.272
<v Ricky Horton>2000 lbs of brackets. Yeah. I mean,
it looks just super simple. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1812-1
05:31:19.272 --> 05:31:27.666
<v Ricky Horton>that's why I was wondering if, yeah,
can you run this? I thought it helped.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1812-2
05:31:27.666 --> 05:31:28.660
<v Ricky Horton>I see it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1813-0
05:31:28.780 --> 05:31:35.901
<v Ricky Horton>Said. What would you guys do on your saw?
You can just change your blade out for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1813-1
05:31:35.901 --> 05:31:36.340
<v Ricky Horton>this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1814-0
05:31:37.940 --> 05:31:42.939
<v Ricky Horton>That depends. Obviously,
if we're running a specialty metal and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1814-1
05:31:42.939 --> 05:31:49.265
<v Ricky Horton>stainless, yeah, we'll we'll switch out,
but I guess we're about on cutting too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1814-2
05:31:49.265 --> 05:31:54.420
<v Ricky Horton>So more than likely that,
but I could imagine that the blades you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1814-3
05:31:54.420 --> 05:31:57.700
<v Ricky Horton>use for being do a good job cutting units.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1815-0
05:31:57.780 --> 05:32:01.888
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
probably going for a little bit finer of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1815-1
05:32:01.888 --> 05:32:05.820
<v Ricky Horton>a tooth, right?
It's it's jagged as we have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1816-0
05:32:07.340 --> 05:32:07.740
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1817-0
05:32:11.300 --> 05:32:15.192
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I got the bundle coming apart.
It's just if that saw is working,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1817-1
05:32:15.192 --> 05:32:18.700
<v Ricky Horton>interrupting it, you know,
you better just run it for a day and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1817-2
05:32:18.700 --> 05:32:20.180
<v Ricky Horton>change the blade and do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1818-0
05:32:26.740 --> 05:32:31.720
<v Ricky Horton>By the way, there is a limit in that list.
Oh yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1818-1
05:32:31.720 --> 05:32:36.355
<v Ricky Horton>I found that out a few weeks ago,
so I closed it out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1818-2
05:32:36.355 --> 05:32:41.420
<v Ricky Horton>Some of your closed projects would be new,
but there is a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1819-0
05:32:42.100 --> 05:32:45.225
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that'll be that'll be the one that's in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1819-1
05:32:45.225 --> 05:32:48.620
<v Ricky Horton>the filter list when he's looking at jobs,
I see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1820-0
05:33:01.540 --> 05:33:06.466
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess to the question that jobs
don't automatically close when they ship,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1820-1
05:33:06.466 --> 05:33:07.900
<v Ricky Horton>the jobs do not better.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-0
05:33:10.780 --> 05:33:15.381
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody seems to want them done.
I didn't even close them until I got a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-1
05:33:15.381 --> 05:33:18.800
<v Ricky Horton>change. I didn't. That's what I'm used to.
Yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-2
05:33:18.800 --> 05:33:23.400
<v Ricky Horton>or the leadership develops for it.
They don't automatically close at all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-3
05:33:23.400 --> 05:33:26.322
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
our system we use automatically close on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-4
05:33:26.322 --> 05:33:29.430
<v Ricky Horton>shipment.
The invoicing people would have to open</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1821-5
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:30.300
<v Ricky Horton>it back up to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1822-0
05:33:30.340 --> 05:33:32.460
<v Ricky Horton>To the file.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1823-0
05:33:33.540 --> 05:33:37.220
<v Ricky Horton>I imagine you can set the clothes on
wherever you want to close.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1824-0
05:33:45.420 --> 05:33:52.743
<v Ricky Horton>I'm curious.
Picklet probably has just one right there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1824-1
05:33:52.743 --> 05:33:54.340
<v Ricky Horton>in the blue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1825-0
05:33:55.300 --> 05:33:57.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this one. It's here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1826-0
05:34:04.020 --> 05:34:09.140
<v Ricky Horton>Then open up one of those and um or hit
the eyeball next to one line.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1827-0
05:34:14.180 --> 05:34:17.340
<v Ricky Horton>I'm curious about the public cutting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1828-0
05:34:20.660 --> 05:34:22.780
<v Ricky Horton>And hit process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1829-0
05:34:24.980 --> 05:34:31.187
<v Ricky Horton>The last one of the one that might be the
only thing is you know how how we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1829-1
05:34:31.187 --> 05:34:36.169
<v Ricky Horton>identify which ones you can bundle,
which ones you couldn't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1829-2
05:34:36.169 --> 05:34:42.702
<v Ricky Horton>So you you you the only way to find out
is really go into the eyeball on one of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1829-3
05:34:42.702 --> 05:34:44.580
<v Ricky Horton>those and process like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1830-0
05:34:44.660 --> 05:34:48.020
<v Ricky Horton>We did that it tells me to tell you what
over.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1831-0
05:34:49.500 --> 05:34:49.740
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1832-0
05:34:55.220 --> 05:34:57.260
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, that's a that's a one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1833-0
05:35:06.660 --> 05:35:11.176
<v Ricky Horton>So the logic's not in here to make sure
that it does that. No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1833-1
05:35:11.176 --> 05:35:16.696
<v Ricky Horton>because you know when they build it's
like building a structural environment</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1833-2
05:35:16.696 --> 05:35:22.574
<v Ricky Horton>and you know it's it's not often you're
building on that and so but it will allow</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1833-3
05:35:22.574 --> 05:35:22.860
<v Ricky Horton>you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1834-0
05:35:23.020 --> 05:35:26.688
<v Ricky Horton>So if if it sees so many bars up that are
identical,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1834-1
05:35:26.688 --> 05:35:30.632
<v Ricky Horton>they don't give you a quantity up here.
There's like 14.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1834-2
05:35:30.632 --> 05:35:35.338
<v Ricky Horton>So you can say I've got four,
four of those together right there to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1834-3
05:35:35.338 --> 05:35:36.860
<v Ricky Horton>process all four bars.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1835-0
05:35:38.820 --> 05:35:43.049
<v Ricky Horton>It's interesting that they've got 5 and
three eights, five and a half,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1835-1
05:35:43.049 --> 05:35:44.300
<v Ricky Horton>five and five eights.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1836-0
05:35:45.620 --> 05:35:48.380
<v Ricky Horton>But there must be was a little bit of
slope in that building or something.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1837-0
05:35:54.020 --> 05:35:56.256
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
I guess what I'm saying is you could</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1837-1
05:35:56.256 --> 05:36:00.520
<v Ricky Horton>really get those very easily mixed up,
'cause they're just so slightly different,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1837-2
05:36:00.520 --> 05:36:00.780
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1838-0
05:36:02.300 --> 05:36:06.990
<v Ricky Horton>Now if you had stick out allowance in
your nuts,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1838-1
05:36:06.990 --> 05:36:12.540
<v Ricky Horton>you could probably eliminate all those
different lengths.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1839-0
05:36:14.020 --> 05:36:22.880
<v Ricky Horton>And just let the extra stick out and hang
below your dents. Yeah, that there we go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1839-1
05:36:22.880 --> 05:36:28.787
<v Ricky Horton>That we're getting some more.
So if we could, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1839-2
05:36:28.787 --> 05:36:30.580
<v Ricky Horton>somehow identify.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1840-0
05:36:30.660 --> 05:36:32.620
<v Ricky Horton>Did you see how close that works and what?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1841-0
05:36:33.740 --> 05:36:39.106
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that's the drop. Yeah.
So if I go back and go here, see,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1841-1
05:36:39.106 --> 05:36:45.174
<v Ricky Horton>these are 10 foot six, three,
one part of the bar on these 20 first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1841-2
05:36:45.174 --> 05:36:49.220
<v Ricky Horton>We'll get back to this challenge that I
made.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1842-0
05:36:49.540 --> 05:36:50.700
<v Ricky Horton>Easy to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1843-0
05:36:52.100 --> 05:36:57.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I took that to the four foot. Yeah,
I got it. Those are just drops. So yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1844-0
05:36:59.140 --> 05:37:05.592
<v Ricky Horton>So if you so you went for 20s,
but is it you could create a stop list of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1844-1
05:37:05.592 --> 05:37:12.661
<v Ricky Horton>less than two and twelves? Yeah, yeah,
I combine it against 20s and twelves and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1844-2
05:37:12.661 --> 05:37:14.340
<v Ricky Horton>once again the 20s.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1845-0
05:37:14.740 --> 05:37:24.380
<v Ricky Horton>Or but it's always looking for the low
usage factors, so it's gonna try and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1846-0
05:37:26.780 --> 05:37:32.819
<v Ricky Horton>What's the 9595 and 7-8 you're dropping
it? Yeah, that's you. That's the problem.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1846-1
05:37:32.819 --> 05:37:38.784
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we're having a slot ahead for it.
I remember to pick back for this 10 foot</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1846-2
05:37:38.784 --> 05:37:42.245
<v Ricky Horton>six. Yeah,
I think 12 makes sense here because</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1846-3
05:37:42.245 --> 05:37:44.380
<v Ricky Horton>you're dropping way too much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1847-0
05:37:45.620 --> 05:37:55.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's weird. Oh,
that's that's not wrong.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1848-0
05:37:57.060 --> 05:38:03.900
<v Ricky Horton>And found anybody, like if you need any,
you know we have 144 for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1849-0
05:38:04.980 --> 05:38:14.011
<v Ricky Horton>Good goal. Finish. Yeah, exactly.
So seems to be seems to be functioning as</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1849-1
05:38:14.011 --> 05:38:17.100
<v Ricky Horton>intended. Yeah, let's see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1850-0
05:38:21.300 --> 05:38:27.193
<v Ricky Horton>Only thing I want to figure out is like,
you know, how I would know, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1850-1
05:38:27.193 --> 05:38:32.937
<v Ricky Horton>if I would go out there today, how,
how would I know what I can bum the cut?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1850-2
05:38:32.937 --> 05:38:35.100
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. Who do you buy?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1851-0
05:38:36.260 --> 05:38:40.738
<v Ricky Horton>This one was wrong.
That's what they wanted to ask Jimmy is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1851-1
05:38:40.738 --> 05:38:44.619
<v Ricky Horton>if it was was a threaded end.
Is it a threaded end?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1851-2
05:38:44.619 --> 05:38:48.201
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if the douglas shot as a
threader.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1851-3
05:38:48.201 --> 05:38:51.260
<v Ricky Horton>I don't thread the bottom parts of these.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1852-0
05:38:51.380 --> 05:38:54.695
<v Ricky Horton>Or if it needs to be bought as all
threads,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1852-1
05:38:54.695 --> 05:39:00.195
<v Ricky Horton>or we'll buy it up from Duncan and off
thread, I think it's right there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1852-2
05:39:00.195 --> 05:39:03.660
<v Ricky Horton>That's why would you think it's Duncan
stone.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1853-0
05:39:04.540 --> 05:39:05.100
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1854-0
05:39:06.660 --> 05:39:10.736
<v Ricky Horton>I'd be surprised if David's at the end.
It'll be so much later.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1854-1
05:39:10.736 --> 05:39:16.022
<v Ricky Horton>It should just be all for a you thing and
you have full adjustable capabilities on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1854-2
05:39:16.022 --> 05:39:16.340
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1855-0
05:39:20.940 --> 05:39:24.340
<v Ricky Horton>But I've seen crazier things, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1856-0
05:39:27.940 --> 05:39:28.660
<v Ricky Horton>You gotta say it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1857-0
05:39:30.340 --> 05:39:36.422
<v Ricky Horton>You would think that there's a supplier
that just supplies us all out of the past.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1857-1
05:39:36.422 --> 05:39:41.039
<v Ricky Horton>He was driving with all grids and
freaking support about that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1857-2
05:39:41.039 --> 05:39:44.630
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty sure I can find somebody who
is also,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1857-3
05:39:44.630 --> 05:39:48.220
<v Ricky Horton>but maybe that's the he's not going to
get into.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1858-0
05:39:48.420 --> 05:39:55.875
<v Ricky Horton>They got to hope that somebody looked to
see if they can buy now and then they</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1858-1
05:39:55.875 --> 05:40:00.404
<v Ricky Horton>said, well,
for this quantity we can do it way,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1858-2
05:40:00.404 --> 05:40:03.140
<v Ricky Horton>you know, for half the price.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1859-0
05:40:03.820 --> 05:40:08.246
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
or the lead time is 3 months and we need</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1859-1
05:40:08.246 --> 05:40:09.940
<v Ricky Horton>it in three weeks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1860-0
05:40:15.700 --> 05:40:18.786
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I I don't see any issue with doing this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1860-1
05:40:18.786 --> 05:40:22.610
<v Ricky Horton>thing. I don't know why they were curious.
Well, I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1860-2
05:40:22.610 --> 05:40:27.708
<v Ricky Horton>this is we've ran the money initial
projects through here and a lot of this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1860-3
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:30.860
<v Ricky Horton>is freaking night and day for anything we
run.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1861-0
05:40:31.220 --> 05:40:35.331
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's may I get as big as the XL import.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1861-1
05:40:35.331 --> 05:40:40.726
<v Ricky Horton>I've given that example XL imports the
same report we came up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1861-2
05:40:40.726 --> 05:40:47.406
<v Ricky Horton>So would you take the time in their
database to get rid of that half inch rod</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1861-3
05:40:47.406 --> 05:40:50.660
<v Ricky Horton>and put the right stuff in so it gets.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1862-0
05:40:50.940 --> 05:40:56.932
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I mean, if it was all thread,
I guess just going here and switch to all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1862-1
05:40:56.932 --> 05:41:00.542
<v Ricky Horton>threads,
it's gonna keep the same and keep the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1862-2
05:41:00.542 --> 05:41:04.460
<v Ricky Horton>same logic.
So time we're going from a linear to a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1862-3
05:41:04.460 --> 05:41:06.380
<v Ricky Horton>plate, so and going here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1863-0
05:41:07.740 --> 05:41:11.449
<v Ricky Horton>Percent all three of the run and no half
inch.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1863-1
05:41:11.449 --> 05:41:17.920
<v Ricky Horton>It's not that that's in my lane category.
I'm going to keep it the same length so</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1863-2
05:41:17.920 --> 05:41:22.260
<v Ricky Horton>it should be offered the same amount
across the board.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1864-0
05:41:22.500 --> 05:41:31.220
<v Ricky Horton>So in that one I can get a 144 so but I'm
going to get 24 so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1866-0
05:41:32.980 --> 05:41:38.024
<v Ricky Horton>Did you need the head of piece tracking
or reports? We need the default,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1866-1
05:41:38.024 --> 05:41:43.689
<v Ricky Horton>but you have the default default for that.
So piece tracking is on for everything</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1866-2
05:41:43.689 --> 05:41:48.180
<v Ricky Horton>from all the routing and assembly routes
and the apartments, OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1867-0
05:41:48.580 --> 05:41:57.501
<v Ricky Horton>So and then so now now we have cut saw
and burn routes that are just for parts</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1867-1
05:41:57.501 --> 05:42:03.260
<v Ricky Horton>and then we have taken Weld for the main
assembly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1868-0
05:42:03.660 --> 05:42:04.340
<v Ricky Horton>Gotcha.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1869-0
05:42:05.900 --> 05:42:09.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll change that so that I can do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1870-0
05:42:16.020 --> 05:42:17.540
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1871-0
05:42:19.980 --> 05:42:21.620
<v Ricky Horton>Should have an issue.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1872-0
05:42:22.700 --> 05:42:22.980
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1873-0
05:42:29.700 --> 05:42:29.820
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1874-0
05:42:31.300 --> 05:42:33.500
<v Ricky Horton>OK, all good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1875-0
05:42:45.380 --> 05:42:46.780
<v Ricky Horton>Say confirm alternative.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1876-0
05:42:52.980 --> 05:42:56.100
<v Ricky Horton>Even though it'll be long.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1877-0
05:42:57.260 --> 05:43:08.932
<v Ricky Horton>He's one of the landlord. Yeah,
that's what I remember you say. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1877-1
05:43:08.932 --> 05:43:12.100
<v Ricky Horton>that's what I have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1878-0
05:43:12.380 --> 05:43:15.853
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we were in the house room or a pardon.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1878-1
05:43:15.853 --> 05:43:21.794
<v Ricky Horton>I was in the town of Chandler and I'll
never hear the end of the fact that I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1878-2
05:43:21.794 --> 05:43:25.420
<v Ricky Horton>forgot to like **** *** my twill with you,
so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1879-0
05:43:26.140 --> 05:43:34.440
<v Ricky Horton>It's freaking making my wife clean ****
*** the toilet seat for you. I was like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1879-1
05:43:34.440 --> 05:43:41.100
<v Ricky Horton>I'm freaking telling you. Sorry,
I forgot I was freaking moving.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1880-0
05:43:41.940 --> 05:43:49.065
<v Ricky Horton>Ever since then, he is to be my boss.
Jimmy is to be my boss and my mentor for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1880-1
05:43:49.065 --> 05:43:54.296
<v Ricky Horton>the longest time.
Jared was my boss and Jimmy was my boss</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1880-2
05:43:54.296 --> 05:43:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>and Mark became my boss.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1881-0
05:43:56.900 --> 05:43:57.180
<v Ricky Horton>Start.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1882-0
05:43:59.540 --> 05:44:05.759
<v Ricky Horton>But my interview was I don't want to work.
You work hard. You have a job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1882-1
05:44:05.759 --> 05:44:11.642
<v Ricky Horton>We'll figure that out on Monday.
We'll see you at 6:00 AM. All right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1882-2
05:44:11.642 --> 05:44:17.860
<v Ricky Horton>That's when I got all the books for Fab
Troll and I just started reading.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1883-0
05:44:18.500 --> 05:44:25.991
<v Ricky Horton>And yeah, once I figured that one out,
then this one was a lot easier.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1883-1
05:44:25.991 --> 05:44:33.060
<v Ricky Horton>A lot more, more videos for it.
That's very that's the damn share.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1884-0
05:44:33.420 --> 05:44:38.914
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's a lot more flexible,
but you got 40 ways of doing the same</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1884-1
05:44:38.914 --> 05:44:45.035
<v Ricky Horton>thing. They could take for 20 more.
Here's what you did there, left to right,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1884-2
05:44:45.035 --> 05:44:47.860
<v Ricky Horton>the last name, yes, but it was good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1885-0
05:44:48.460 --> 05:45:02.580
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, especially estimating.
It's hard to get estimated. Yep, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1886-0
05:45:03.980 --> 05:45:07.059
<v Ricky Horton>I also had to do all my manual well
take-ups,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1886-1
05:45:07.059 --> 05:45:12.481
<v Ricky Horton>all I have freaking binders of drawings
and I'd be going through calculating the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1886-2
05:45:12.481 --> 05:45:17.301
<v Ricky Horton>wells. Everything else is easy.
I get all that stuff done with the well</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1886-3
05:45:17.301 --> 05:45:20.580
<v Ricky Horton>take-ups over and over and I go to each
drawing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1887-0
05:45:20.940 --> 05:45:28.752
<v Ricky Horton>Well, this might be interesting.
So this is the last I'm over shop next</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1887-1
05:45:28.752 --> 05:45:36.020
<v Ricky Horton>month that I had originally set it up
with this 2-3 years ago and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1888-0
05:45:36.380 --> 05:45:40.410
<v Ricky Horton>They're an estimator wanted to majorly
put in every building here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1888-1
05:45:40.410 --> 05:45:44.380
<v Ricky Horton>It's in the labor case.
Let it do the things that he was adamant.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1888-2
05:45:44.380 --> 05:45:48.951
<v Ricky Horton>He went through there and they had a set
of estimators and all of them were</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1888-3
05:45:48.951 --> 05:45:52.620
<v Ricky Horton>banging like, why are we doing this?
Why are we having that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1889-0
05:45:52.700 --> 05:45:58.342
<v Ricky Horton>So it's taking 400 long to do this,
you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1889-1
05:45:58.342 --> 05:46:05.700
<v Ricky Horton>I will be curious to see if we're still
doing that. That's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1890-0
05:46:08.020 --> 05:46:10.180
<v Ricky Horton>That's some as we say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1891-0
05:46:11.340 --> 05:46:16.339
<v Ricky Horton>Pre-2020, yeah. Well, for me, at least,
yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1891-1
05:46:16.339 --> 05:46:25.141
<v Ricky Horton>20/18/2019 was all fast roll for me and
then in 2020 was when we had end of life</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1891-2
05:46:25.141 --> 05:46:30.900
<v Ricky Horton>fast roll and we bought Tesla and we were
basically.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-0
05:46:30.940 --> 05:46:34.686
<v Ricky Horton>You know where they get to the point
where they're like, Papa,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-1
05:46:34.686 --> 05:46:38.848
<v Ricky Horton>we ain't facing ****. Yeah,
duplicate this **** over and you're using</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-2
05:46:38.848 --> 05:46:43.544
<v Ricky Horton>this. I don't care. I was like, OK,
I guess I'll learn it. And usually people,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-3
05:46:43.544 --> 05:46:47.409
<v Ricky Horton>when people say, yeah,
we're working on that and we're facing it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-4
05:46:47.409 --> 05:46:49.965
<v Ricky Horton>in,
because they're not really going to do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1892-5
05:46:49.965 --> 05:46:50.500
<v Ricky Horton>anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1893-0
05:46:50.540 --> 05:46:56.355
<v Ricky Horton>I love going to shops and say, all right,
guys, Monday, here's where we're starting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1893-1
05:46:56.355 --> 05:46:59.913
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm good.
I'm just the one to down and then I'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1893-2
05:46:59.913 --> 05:47:04.701
<v Ricky Horton>figure it out. Yeah, well,
that's how it wasn't this. When I started,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1893-3
05:47:04.701 --> 05:47:09.900
<v Ricky Horton>I had full permissions. I had everything.
So it was like, oh, I wrote that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-0
05:47:10.420 --> 05:47:13.233
<v Ricky Horton>OK, yeah,
now I'm gonna figure out how to fix it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-1
05:47:13.233 --> 05:47:16.275
<v Ricky Horton>and it's good. OK,
that's how you figure things out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-2
05:47:16.275 --> 05:47:20.637
<v Ricky Horton>You break it and then you got to fix it
and now I'm sure that works for it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-3
05:47:20.637 --> 05:47:23.564
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
which now I now I know a lot of different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-4
05:47:23.564 --> 05:47:27.123
<v Ricky Horton>ways to do a lot of different things in
here. Yeah, honestly,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1894-5
05:47:27.123 --> 05:47:29.820
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to treat this the only thing
I've.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1895-0
05:47:29.820 --> 05:47:35.916
<v Ricky Horton>And then we're really fussed with and and
have the ability to be. Most people,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1895-1
05:47:35.916 --> 05:47:40.777
<v Ricky Horton>though I I had to use it, but yeah,
most people are there too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1895-2
05:47:40.777 --> 05:47:43.940
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think anybody served my own shop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1896-0
05:47:46.020 --> 05:47:52.260
<v Ricky Horton>Small projects and running them myself.
Our break off was if it was detailed,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1896-1
05:47:52.260 --> 05:47:56.660
<v Ricky Horton>it was a production job.
It wasn't detailed if it was,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1896-2
05:47:56.660 --> 05:48:02.180
<v Ricky Horton>but we did all some residential meetings
for some local contractors.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1897-0
05:48:02.860 --> 05:48:07.571
<v Ricky Horton>We probably ran a couple $1,000,
000 worth of stuff through the order</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1897-1
05:48:07.571 --> 05:48:12.618
<v Ricky Horton>engine. It was great for, you know,
pull the inventory and it would, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1897-2
05:48:12.618 --> 05:48:18.271
<v Ricky Horton>we could create the invoices out of here
and so it was good for that kind of stuff,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1897-3
05:48:18.271 --> 05:48:18.540
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1898-0
05:48:19.100 --> 05:48:24.553
<v Ricky Horton>It's 100% paper driven that you can't do
anything on getting with it or anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1898-1
05:48:24.553 --> 05:48:29.474
<v Ricky Horton>So oh, I was going to ask you,
I was trouble with the mentions this year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1898-2
05:48:29.474 --> 05:48:34.860
<v Ricky Horton>It was good because it was it gets better
every year. I tried to get them to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1899-0
05:48:35.300 --> 05:48:40.323
<v Ricky Horton>More sessions. I did two sessions.
But I figured, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1899-1
05:48:40.323 --> 05:48:45.614
<v Ricky Horton>the more sessions they do,
the more people come. But yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1899-2
05:48:45.614 --> 05:48:51.892
<v Ricky Horton>that's good. That's good. Yeah.
And probably I was supposed to build.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1899-3
05:48:51.892 --> 05:48:52.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1900-0
05:48:52.780 --> 05:48:55.568
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
And then long roll they're going</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1900-1
05:48:55.568 --> 05:48:59.498
<v Ricky Horton>percentage per Vista. Oh really?
And they had a whole,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1900-2
05:48:59.498 --> 05:49:05.287
<v Ricky Horton>a whole topic that they were speaking on
and how they have Vista integrated with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1900-3
05:49:05.287 --> 05:49:08.860
<v Ricky Horton>the PTO system and and doing all that.
Yeah, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1901-0
05:49:09.020 --> 05:49:09.140
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1902-0
05:49:11.220 --> 05:49:16.995
<v Ricky Horton>Anyway, it should be gone.
It should be me. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1902-1
05:49:16.995 --> 05:49:25.540
<v Ricky Horton>I guess the cool thing about it is,
you know they they are there to help.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1903-0
05:49:26.540 --> 05:49:30.913
<v Ricky Horton>They want to hear from you and what you
want. And so like they did one session,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1903-1
05:49:30.913 --> 05:49:33.536
<v Ricky Horton>we'll bring up,
we'll bring up the video on it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1903-2
05:49:33.536 --> 05:49:37.252
<v Ricky Horton>but they did one session where it's like,
OK, here's what's coming,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1903-3
05:49:37.252 --> 05:49:40.313
<v Ricky Horton>tell us what you think. Yeah,
although their thing was,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1903-4
05:49:40.313 --> 05:49:41.460
<v Ricky Horton>here's what's coming.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1904-0
05:49:42.540 --> 05:49:47.271
<v Ricky Horton>We're a little promising, but you know,
here's what's coming, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1904-1
05:49:47.271 --> 05:49:52.461
<v Ricky Horton>because I can't really say what's coming
outside of the current folder anyway,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1904-2
05:49:52.461 --> 05:49:53.380
<v Ricky Horton>they're doing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1905-0
05:49:56.220 --> 05:49:59.604
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, OK,
restrict user cut lists and work packages</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1905-1
05:49:59.604 --> 05:50:02.532
<v Ricky Horton>by location. So that's yeah,
multiple shots.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1905-2
05:50:02.532 --> 05:50:05.460
<v Ricky Horton>They they always see their shots though.
Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1906-0
05:50:07.700 --> 05:50:13.990
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, estimating this one. This was mine.
I made good for this and I had multiple</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1906-1
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:19.258
<v Ricky Horton>meetings with him about it.
They're a study I'm estimating so that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1906-2
05:50:19.258 --> 05:50:21.380
<v Ricky Horton>you can get a breakdown by.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1907-0
05:50:22.700 --> 05:50:27.012
<v Ricky Horton>Multiple different things.
I'm not sure about how we're doing it yet,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1907-1
05:50:27.012 --> 05:50:30.092
<v Ricky Horton>but what I asked them is in the estimate
summary,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1907-2
05:50:30.092 --> 05:50:34.589
<v Ricky Horton>you can hit the summary drop down at the
top and choose cost. It'll get.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1907-3
05:50:34.589 --> 05:50:38.900
<v Ricky Horton>It'll break the estimate down by cost,
which you're not really using.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1908-0
05:50:39.220 --> 05:50:44.527
<v Ricky Horton>But I I I asked him there,
I want to have an option there for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1908-1
05:50:44.527 --> 05:50:48.977
<v Ricky Horton>category, subcategory page,
give me a custom field,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1908-2
05:50:48.977 --> 05:50:54.540
<v Ricky Horton>but I need some way to break down the
estimate cause like if if.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1909-0
05:50:54.620 --> 05:50:58.220
<v Ricky Horton>Client is like,
I need a I need a dollar for this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1909-1
05:50:58.220 --> 05:51:01.604
<v Ricky Horton>building at that building.
I was going to say,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1909-2
05:51:01.604 --> 05:51:05.276
<v Ricky Horton>get three or four buildings,
you know what I said.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1909-3
05:51:05.276 --> 05:51:10.532
<v Ricky Horton>All four of those buildings. Yeah.
And it's going to be able to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1909-4
05:51:10.532 --> 05:51:14.060
<v Ricky Horton>You don't really have a way of doing that.
Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1910-0
05:51:14.140 --> 05:51:19.337
<v Ricky Horton>That's the codes when you have to say,
put it in building A, B, C, D, whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1910-1
05:51:19.337 --> 05:51:23.689
<v Ricky Horton>So it's permanent over there.
That's the way that's what happened.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1910-2
05:51:23.689 --> 05:51:28.041
<v Ricky Horton>So I shouldn't be able to.
Multiple workers thought it on the same</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1910-3
05:51:28.041 --> 05:51:29.340
<v Ricky Horton>basis for happening.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1911-0
05:51:29.380 --> 05:51:34.740
<v Ricky Horton>You will be able to say nothing ships on
my side is complete,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1911-1
05:51:34.740 --> 05:51:39.668
<v Ricky Horton>which I've never done a thing,
but that'll be an option,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1911-2
05:51:39.668 --> 05:51:42.780
<v Ricky Horton>which I haven't looked for a little.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1912-0
05:51:45.620 --> 05:51:51.220
<v Ricky Horton>To be able to attach documents on the
loading screen when you're sharing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1914-0
05:51:52.340 --> 05:52:01.241
<v Ricky Horton>Some of the matrix, yes. You're going,
you're going to be able to finalize when</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1914-1
05:52:01.241 --> 05:52:05.580
<v Ricky Horton>you receive on together if you want to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1915-0
05:52:07.220 --> 05:52:12.292
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have any reporting in there.
Everybody does.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1915-1
05:52:12.292 --> 05:52:19.661
<v Ricky Horton>I got stuck with every single one we've
ever done at this company. Yeah. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1915-2
05:52:19.661 --> 05:52:22.340
<v Ricky Horton>you know how to do that? OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1916-0
05:52:22.740 --> 05:52:29.726
<v Ricky Horton>I was like, no, I didn't, but now I do.
It's the assembly lane is going to become</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1916-1
05:52:29.726 --> 05:52:35.264
<v Ricky Horton>more prominent as well.
I've kind of think we're talking about a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1916-2
05:52:35.264 --> 05:52:40.631
<v Ricky Horton>20 foot length of slice,
so the assembly length is going to be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1916-3
05:52:40.631 --> 05:52:42.420
<v Ricky Horton>more prominent there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1917-0
05:52:42.500 --> 05:52:47.293
<v Ricky Horton>Where we use a lot of reports in order as
well. So, but that, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1917-1
05:52:47.293 --> 05:52:51.287
<v Ricky Horton>they have recession where it's like,
how should we do this?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1917-2
05:52:51.287 --> 05:52:55.015
<v Ricky Horton>What should we be able to do this?
And that type stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1917-3
05:52:55.015 --> 05:53:00.008
<v Ricky Horton>So picking user's brains. Yeah.
Figure out what the real world's thinking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1917-4
05:53:00.008 --> 05:53:00.340
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1918-0
05:53:00.900 --> 05:53:04.613
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's.
I could care less of this in Vegas.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1918-1
05:53:04.613 --> 05:53:09.364
<v Ricky Horton>That's a perk. But yeah, I wanted to.
I've always wanted to go.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1918-2
05:53:09.364 --> 05:53:11.220
<v Ricky Horton>I asked every year. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1919-0
05:53:12.980 --> 05:53:16.342
<v Ricky Horton>It's a that's an expensive conference,
man.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1919-1
05:53:16.342 --> 05:53:21.766
<v Ricky Horton>It's like 1700 bucks a person or
something like that, which, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1919-2
05:53:21.766 --> 05:53:27.572
<v Ricky Horton>all in all, it's worth it. But you know,
it's it used to be like 600 bucks,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1919-3
05:53:27.572 --> 05:53:29.100
<v Ricky Horton>something like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1920-0
05:53:29.300 --> 05:53:41.093
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, absolutely. But I need to do this.
That's one of the reason I speak,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1920-1
05:53:41.093 --> 05:53:47.540
<v Ricky Horton>because we're 700 knowledge when I speak.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1921-0
05:53:47.620 --> 05:53:51.180
<v Ricky Horton>That's perfectly the same.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1922-0
05:53:53.140 --> 05:53:59.916
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there we go.
They're going to send me and Bob and I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1922-1
05:53:59.916 --> 05:54:07.626
<v Ricky Horton>was like, I don't care,
send me no one to be on the Bravo project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1922-2
05:54:07.626 --> 05:54:10.780
<v Ricky Horton>and then they went to that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1923-0
05:54:11.140 --> 05:54:15.057
<v Ricky Horton>A convention in Chicago for all the
equipment Fabtech. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1923-1
05:54:15.057 --> 05:54:20.387
<v Ricky Horton>and we had like 5 guys in the Fabtech and
then spent all this money going up there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1923-2
05:54:20.387 --> 05:54:25.460
<v Ricky Horton>with getting the equipment we were never
going to buy. And they were like, oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1923-3
05:54:25.460 --> 05:54:27.900
<v Ricky Horton>this kind of just seemed like a waste.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1924-0
05:54:28.260 --> 05:54:33.071
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that was a waste.
We knew that was a waste when we got into</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1924-1
05:54:33.071 --> 05:54:36.279
<v Ricky Horton>it.
Careful dimensions wouldn't have been a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1924-2
05:54:36.279 --> 05:54:39.850
<v Ricky Horton>waste.
I was taking notes I would have and tried</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1924-3
05:54:39.850 --> 05:54:45.244
<v Ricky Horton>to have a good take away from it.
That was that was purely knowledge that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1924-4
05:54:45.244 --> 05:54:45.900
<v Ricky Horton>is truly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1925-0
05:54:46.100 --> 05:54:50.448
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, right. Unless,
unless you've got a serious buy off for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1925-1
05:54:50.448 --> 05:54:56.078
<v Ricky Horton>some equipment before you go into it,
you ain't going to go there and and say,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1925-2
05:54:56.078 --> 05:54:59.000
<v Ricky Horton>well,
I found that half a million dollar</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1925-3
05:54:59.000 --> 05:55:02.420
<v Ricky Horton>machine I really want.
We think we can do this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1926-0
05:55:02.420 --> 05:55:06.540
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe, yeah,
we used to send to people every year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1927-0
05:55:09.020 --> 05:55:14.075
<v Ricky Horton>Like, yeah, I don't think so. Well,
you already do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1927-1
05:55:14.075 --> 05:55:18.060
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of the vendors come see you anyway.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1928-0
05:55:20.300 --> 05:55:26.729
<v Ricky Horton>Benefit is if you are shopping for a
bunch of, you know, starting to shop,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1928-1
05:55:26.729 --> 05:55:32.386
<v Ricky Horton>you see everybody. Yeah.
So that was a GT that was here the other</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1928-2
05:55:32.386 --> 05:55:35.900
<v Ricky Horton>day. Is that correct? Yeah, that that is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1929-0
05:55:36.100 --> 05:55:41.068
<v Ricky Horton>Who's looking to bond?
Who's Who's still needing to do all that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1929-1
05:55:41.068 --> 05:55:45.500
<v Ricky Horton>Mark. Mark through. Yeah,
here's what here's who visited.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1930-0
05:55:46.940 --> 05:55:52.871
<v Ricky Horton>Something to consider. Yeah,
I need to talk to Mark because I was all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1930-1
05:55:52.871 --> 05:55:58.209
<v Ricky Horton>in on the line on that.
I traveled to their place in Canada to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1930-2
05:55:58.209 --> 05:56:03.971
<v Ricky Horton>check them out, talk with the programmers.
I love that issue. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1930-3
05:56:03.971 --> 05:56:05.580
<v Ricky Horton>what's it good for?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1931-0
05:56:06.020 --> 05:56:11.282
<v Ricky Horton>So it is a robotic building,
but it's it's well known.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1931-1
05:56:11.282 --> 05:56:18.745
<v Ricky Horton>It's not it's not sure unless you have
you have to pack it in it and then you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1931-2
05:56:18.745 --> 05:56:22.380
<v Ricky Horton>put it in its space which rotates and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1932-0
05:56:22.940 --> 05:56:28.480
<v Ricky Horton>Then you download from the instructions
for us and give directly to their</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1932-1
05:56:28.480 --> 05:56:31.100
<v Ricky Horton>software. It runs things saying OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1933-0
05:56:32.180 --> 05:56:35.784
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I can tell what's the best way to build</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1933-1
05:56:35.784 --> 05:56:39.700
<v Ricky Horton>this. Yeah,
I reach everything that I'm living in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1933-2
05:56:39.700 --> 05:56:43.695
<v Ricky Horton>here, attention, training,
the well site can't do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1933-3
05:56:43.695 --> 05:56:47.220
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe say here's what I want to do.
So like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1934-0
05:56:47.220 --> 05:56:58.086
<v Ricky Horton>We need the first piece that we ran on a
bunch of 12/12/5568 students and to the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1934-1
05:56:58.086 --> 05:57:02.780
<v Ricky Horton>14 minutes to run that up. So it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1935-0
05:57:03.140 --> 05:57:08.670
<v Ricky Horton>We had, we had a 60 foot,
60 foot sale that we that she for that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1935-1
05:57:08.670 --> 05:57:12.924
<v Ricky Horton>one it was 40.
We we we did a 40 footer at first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1935-2
05:57:12.924 --> 05:57:18.284
<v Ricky Horton>So the arm had reached 20 feet or the
carriage moved. So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1935-3
05:57:18.284 --> 05:57:19.900
<v Ricky Horton>the carriage moved.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1936-0
05:57:20.380 --> 05:57:24.405
<v Ricky Horton>So the you put the I'm familiar with it.
Yeah, you put it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1936-1
05:57:24.405 --> 05:57:29.453
<v Ricky Horton>It looks like we're tracking, right.
You put it in there and the computer</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1936-2
05:57:29.453 --> 05:57:34.501
<v Ricky Horton>would would be down here where it would
be down the other area, the well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1936-3
05:57:34.501 --> 05:57:37.980
<v Ricky Horton>and then there'd be a lot based on the
other side.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1937-0
05:57:38.260 --> 05:57:41.352
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well,
not necessarily on the station.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1937-1
05:57:41.352 --> 05:57:46.131
<v Ricky Horton>It just ran a little track to the other
side of the poop. So, well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1937-2
05:57:46.131 --> 05:57:50.277
<v Ricky Horton>I looked at clues.
Clues makes something like that and you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1937-3
05:57:50.277 --> 05:57:53.860
<v Ricky Horton>know, while it's welding,
you want the other side.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1938-0
05:57:54.420 --> 05:57:59.204
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody's setting it up and the ones I
saw were rotating,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1938-1
05:57:59.204 --> 05:58:05.122
<v Ricky Horton>so it would rotate the piece in this
thing. Well, exactly what you said.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1938-2
05:58:05.122 --> 05:58:09.500
<v Ricky Horton>On the other side,
they're loading the next piece in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1939-0
05:58:09.860 --> 05:58:16.977
<v Ricky Horton>So they they we we bought the one cell to
start with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1939-1
05:58:16.977 --> 05:58:24.620
<v Ricky Horton>We bought a single cell thing and so it
it was a 40 foot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-0
05:58:25.780 --> 05:58:28.991
<v Ricky Horton>43 million that was in and so one piece
was in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-1
05:58:28.991 --> 05:58:33.569
<v Ricky Horton>Then when that was done pulling out
through another piece in and then it was</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-2
05:58:33.569 --> 05:58:37.136
<v Ricky Horton>our welding idea.
Their brand and butter that they tried to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-3
05:58:37.136 --> 05:58:40.407
<v Ricky Horton>sell you is a 2 cell thing.
So you got one piece here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-4
05:58:40.407 --> 05:58:43.320
<v Ricky Horton>one piece in here.
So off welding on this piece,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1940-5
05:58:43.320 --> 05:58:45.460
<v Ricky Horton>you're over here packing up on this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1941-0
05:58:45.540 --> 05:58:50.411
<v Ricky Horton>Yes. And then once none of it goes out,
we pull this left the middle,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1941-1
05:58:50.411 --> 05:58:52.220
<v Ricky Horton>we'll start packing it up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1942-0
05:58:53.420 --> 05:58:57.792
<v Ricky Horton>It to me wasn't worth the money because
like we would tack up,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1942-1
05:58:57.792 --> 05:59:01.053
<v Ricky Horton>we'd have a Bay and the brothers on this
side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1942-2
05:59:01.053 --> 05:59:06.674
<v Ricky Horton>we would tack up on this side and then
while it's welding and then bring the PC,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1942-3
05:59:06.674 --> 05:59:09.935
<v Ricky Horton>pull this piece out,
bring another PC into it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1942-4
05:59:09.935 --> 05:59:12.780
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't feel like it was worth an extra.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1943-0
05:59:13.140 --> 05:59:16.658
<v Ricky Horton>$100,
000 and get another area for us to pack</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1943-1
05:59:16.658 --> 05:59:20.559
<v Ricky Horton>up. Yeah,
I just didn't see the benefit except for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1943-2
05:59:20.559 --> 05:59:22.700
<v Ricky Horton>work, maybe about, you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1944-0
05:59:24.460 --> 05:59:30.137
<v Ricky Horton>5 minutes of time to pull the piece out
in another lead.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1944-1
05:59:30.137 --> 05:59:34.220
<v Ricky Horton>How many pieces were you running? So are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1945-0
05:59:35.300 --> 05:59:40.222
<v Ricky Horton>Like on those 12 square columns,
which a lot of that was from red and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1945-1
05:59:40.222 --> 05:59:43.949
<v Ricky Horton>furniture,
we were getting about 28 columns a day or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1945-2
05:59:43.949 --> 05:59:48.660
<v Ricky Horton>shifts, excuse me, 28 columns a shift.
So how are you going to do?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1946-0
05:59:49.540 --> 05:59:51.020
<v Ricky Horton>How do we have to do?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1947-0
05:59:52.300 --> 05:59:56.324
<v Ricky Horton>Like, uh, 10,000,
I mean that that was really a bit better</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1947-1
05:59:56.324 --> 06:00:01.031
<v Ricky Horton>than most of the jobs we're doing
services cost a little bit. So OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1947-2
06:00:01.031 --> 06:00:06.146
<v Ricky Horton>so so it makes sense because we're doing
it forever. Yeah, trying to find,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1947-3
06:00:06.146 --> 06:00:08.260
<v Ricky Horton>I got a video of it early, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1948-0
06:00:09.380 --> 06:00:15.489
<v Ricky Horton>There was always just how many pieces do
you have to judge by the cost of it? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1948-1
06:00:15.489 --> 06:00:20.726
<v Ricky Horton>first the set up of it. I mean,
if you're doing something all the time,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1948-2
06:00:20.726 --> 06:00:24.580
<v Ricky Horton>it would do the work of about 3 1/2 to 4
revolution.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1949-0
06:00:27.460 --> 06:00:28.900
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, it was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1950-0
06:00:30.100 --> 06:00:34.779
<v Ricky Horton>It was worth the money and I think we've
made like, I know it's gone up since then,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1950-1
06:00:34.779 --> 06:00:37.340
<v Ricky Horton>but I think we've made like $600,
000 for it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1951-0
06:00:38.540 --> 06:00:38.700
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1952-0
06:00:40.180 --> 06:00:43.300
<v Ricky Horton>That's so worth.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1953-0
06:00:49.060 --> 06:00:50.580
<v Ricky Horton>A good machine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1954-0
06:00:51.540 --> 06:00:55.177
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there's fair,
fair and weld options out there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1954-1
06:00:55.177 --> 06:00:59.020
<v Ricky Horton>but they're going to be double or triple
the money too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1955-0
06:01:00.660 --> 06:01:05.815
<v Ricky Horton>And we were striving all the all the
pieces of the layout and fill up was</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1955-1
06:01:05.815 --> 06:01:09.925
<v Ricky Horton>nothing, you know,
pretty much just put the line on the on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1955-2
06:01:09.925 --> 06:01:15.428
<v Ricky Horton>the main piece and we took a job for a
solar farm once and it was thousands of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1955-3
06:01:15.428 --> 06:01:17.100
<v Ricky Horton>the same thing and yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1956-0
06:01:18.420 --> 06:01:21.202
<v Ricky Horton>We had one of those Lincoln machines.
Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1956-1
06:01:21.202 --> 06:01:25.438
<v Ricky Horton>we had a table that rotated on this side.
So we well on this side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1956-2
06:01:25.438 --> 06:01:28.915
<v Ricky Horton>well on this side. Yeah,
there was table on this side,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1956-3
06:01:28.915 --> 06:01:33.340
<v Ricky Horton>well on this side, well on this side.
I think we probably put 6 or 8.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1957-0
06:01:33.780 --> 06:01:39.260
<v Ricky Horton>I'll call them columns.
They were a small piece of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1958-0
06:01:40.260 --> 06:01:47.121
<v Ricky Horton>And you're literally, for most of them,
as the welding was so quick, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1958-1
06:01:47.121 --> 06:01:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>that you really just hadn't got all your
parts taxed.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1960-0
06:01:53.220 --> 06:01:57.824
<v Ricky Horton>You know, everything had to get there.
We weren't barely attacking it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1960-1
06:01:57.824 --> 06:02:01.584
<v Ricky Horton>The the biggest problem we were having is
it was finicky,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1960-2
06:02:01.584 --> 06:02:04.890
<v Ricky Horton>but the piece had been exactly in the
right place.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1960-3
06:02:04.890 --> 06:02:08.780
<v Ricky Horton>And I hear that the vision system would
have gotten better.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1961-0
06:02:08.980 --> 06:02:13.831
<v Ricky Horton>And so the vision, if it wasn't there,
it would stop. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1961-1
06:02:13.831 --> 06:02:18.197
<v Ricky Horton>the AGT will do that too.
It feels it scans at first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1961-2
06:02:18.197 --> 06:02:24.260
<v Ricky Horton>It is actually it scans at first with
pieces of there and then it'll stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1962-0
06:02:26.740 --> 06:02:32.666
<v Ricky Horton>The simple little flapper right there
just popped in and it just it's scanned</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1962-1
06:02:32.666 --> 06:02:38.365
<v Ricky Horton>in that wall and and then the tube.
So even if the tube is slightly there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1962-2
06:02:38.365 --> 06:02:38.820
<v Ricky Horton>it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1965-0
06:02:49.740 --> 06:02:53.870
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I don't know.
So that thing with we had one within the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1965-1
06:02:53.870 --> 06:02:59.120
<v Ricky Horton>first month or two that we were just
going full board with it and and that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1965-2
06:02:59.120 --> 06:03:03.740
<v Ricky Horton>well with this side and then it was going
down to the other side.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1965-3
06:03:03.740 --> 06:03:05.980
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody broke it and I'll stop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1966-0
06:03:06.180 --> 06:03:10.550
<v Ricky Horton>And that big carriage was going down and
I'll stop the cool.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1966-1
06:03:10.550 --> 06:03:15.421
<v Ricky Horton>And so I called them and I'm like, guys,
we got a big problem here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1966-2
06:03:15.421 --> 06:03:20.436
<v Ricky Horton>We got a lot of work in this.
I told them what happened and I said we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1966-3
06:03:20.436 --> 06:03:21.940
<v Ricky Horton>called them back, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1967-0
06:03:22.060 --> 06:03:26.409
<v Ricky Horton>30 minutes later, he called them.
That's it. I have a flat look.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1967-1
06:03:26.409 --> 06:03:29.954
<v Ricky Horton>I have a part in my hand.
I'm carrying them with me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1967-2
06:03:29.954 --> 06:03:34.704
<v Ricky Horton>Can we get your? Absolutely.
And so they fixed it overnight and got us</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1967-3
06:03:34.704 --> 06:03:40.056
<v Ricky Horton>back. So what's this thing that I do?
Is this column going to rotate or is this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1967-4
06:03:40.056 --> 06:03:41.460
<v Ricky Horton>mark going to re fix?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1968-0
06:03:42.140 --> 06:03:47.137
<v Ricky Horton>First got we we needed it so bad and they
were like, OK, rotators are not ready.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1968-1
06:03:47.137 --> 06:03:49.913
<v Ricky Horton>So we're like we put it up on bucks for
now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1968-2
06:03:49.913 --> 06:03:53.491
<v Ricky Horton>So this was before we had the before we
had the rotators.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1968-3
06:03:53.491 --> 06:03:57.316
<v Ricky Horton>So you're going to have to rotate this
thing four times. Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1968-4
06:03:57.316 --> 06:04:01.140
<v Ricky Horton>So it it's always well and flat. Sure.
And so yeah, it would.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1969-0
06:04:01.140 --> 06:04:05.376
<v Ricky Horton>Rotate four times. So yeah,
so we can integrate the rotator. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1969-1
06:04:05.376 --> 06:04:08.347
<v Ricky Horton>with our this was quite the pain.
So but yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1969-2
06:04:08.347 --> 06:04:13.532
<v Ricky Horton>then we got the rotators about a month
after that and then once it goes in there,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1969-3
06:04:13.532 --> 06:04:16.060
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, it just rotates it on its own. So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1970-0
06:04:16.260 --> 06:04:20.420
<v Ricky Horton>How much was that 600,000? There was 600,
000 when we bought it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1970-1
06:04:20.420 --> 06:04:23.940
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm hearing it's 8900,
000 or something like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1971-0
06:04:25.300 --> 06:04:27.885
<v Ricky Horton>I believe I'm for sure,
to be quite honest with you,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1971-1
06:04:27.885 --> 06:04:28.860
<v Ricky Horton>the full cross bear.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1972-0
06:04:34.740 --> 06:04:39.020
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I like clues.
Clues was pretty fancy, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1973-0
06:04:42.140 --> 06:04:46.620
<v Ricky Horton>The thing I was most concerned about was
whether we were.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1974-0
06:04:48.740 --> 06:04:51.060
<v Ricky Horton>How easy was it gonna be to get the?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1975-0
06:04:52.580 --> 06:04:58.548
<v Ricky Horton>From the software into their software,
from detailing into their software, I was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1975-1
06:04:58.548 --> 06:05:03.860
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't want to put somebody else on
payroll just to do that, you know?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1975-2
06:05:03.860 --> 06:05:04.660
<v Ricky Horton>And it was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1976-0
06:05:05.740 --> 06:05:09.740
<v Ricky Horton>Honestly, seamless.
It's literally an export import.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1977-0
06:05:10.820 --> 06:05:13.563
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it includes the ones all that German</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1977-1
06:05:13.563 --> 06:05:16.944
<v Ricky Horton>welding equipments and I was like,
do you guys stop,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1977-2
06:05:16.944 --> 06:05:20.580
<v Ricky Horton>get over this ship in the US in case
something goes bad?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1978-0
06:05:23.860 --> 06:05:26.540
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody here,
I'm waiting for consumables from Germany.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1979-0
06:05:27.940 --> 06:05:31.220
<v Ricky Horton>But they were awesome. They were awesome.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1980-0
06:05:34.660 --> 06:05:37.980
<v Ricky Horton>And this was pre COVID when I was looking
at it, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1981-0
06:05:40.540 --> 06:05:47.015
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so I don't know that he was in here,
but I can go over with him,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1981-1
06:05:47.015 --> 06:05:50.580
<v Ricky Horton>but I kind of want to be going to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1982-0
06:05:51.300 --> 06:05:58.466
<v Ricky Horton>Production planner or future production,
current production work packages,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1982-1
06:05:58.466 --> 06:06:04.390
<v Ricky Horton>so on and so forth.
I think that's what they're able to build</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1982-2
06:06:04.390 --> 06:06:06.300
<v Ricky Horton>that into. Yeah, OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1983-0
06:06:07.860 --> 06:06:14.649
<v Ricky Horton>So then we do some set up already on it
to get it kind of set up for departments</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1983-1
06:06:14.649 --> 06:06:19.761
<v Ricky Horton>and stuff. Yeah, yeah,
I know what we did and what we didn't</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1983-2
06:06:19.761 --> 06:06:20.180
<v Ricky Horton>then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1990-0
06:06:55.300 --> 06:06:56.780
<v Ricky Horton>So we have our code.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1991-0
06:06:57.940 --> 06:07:02.555
<v Ricky Horton>And then handling cuts on burning fit,
well, assembly,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1991-1
06:07:02.555 --> 06:07:09.100
<v Ricky Horton>comfort stone and unplanned handling and
quality control. You see that there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1991-2
06:07:09.100 --> 06:07:12.540
<v Ricky Horton>It's still down so we can see the future.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1992-0
06:07:13.780 --> 06:07:19.439
<v Ricky Horton>So that's where you can now do. OK,
we just got this job. It's 5500 hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1992-1
06:07:19.439 --> 06:07:25.625
<v Ricky Horton>So this time frame and then we'll plug it
in there for you and your schedules for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1992-2
06:07:25.625 --> 06:07:29.020
<v Ricky Horton>you'll have it on there for future
planning.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1993-0
06:07:29.340 --> 06:07:35.929
<v Ricky Horton>So essentially, is this just like a form?
Form fill ordinance? So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1993-1
06:07:35.929 --> 06:07:40.504
<v Ricky Horton>you'd have to have the job in later.
How does it?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1993-2
06:07:40.504 --> 06:07:43.340
<v Ricky Horton>How does it know the resources?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1994-0
06:07:44.500 --> 06:07:49.177
<v Ricky Horton>It pulls it from estimating,
which is why it's so critical that in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1994-1
06:07:49.177 --> 06:07:54.761
<v Ricky Horton>estimating they use the labor codes like
we were looking at because it it knows</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1994-2
06:07:54.761 --> 06:07:59.367
<v Ricky Horton>all those different departments and
everybody knows to split out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1994-3
06:07:59.367 --> 06:08:01.740
<v Ricky Horton>So it pulls it from estimating so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1995-0
06:08:02.580 --> 06:08:08.364
<v Ricky Horton>But it also clearly must somehow know how
many people you have in each in each work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1995-1
06:08:08.364 --> 06:08:11.806
<v Ricky Horton>center, right? Yeah,
so there's a resource setup,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1995-2
06:08:11.806 --> 06:08:13.940
<v Ricky Horton>so like cuts also in the hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1996-0
06:08:15.940 --> 06:08:19.176
<v Ricky Horton>Actually,
that's gonna be in production control and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1996-1
06:08:19.176 --> 06:08:20.980
<v Ricky Horton>then fabrication maintenance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1997-0
06:08:22.980 --> 06:08:25.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they gave a appointment.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1998-0
06:08:26.660 --> 06:08:30.700
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, they go to workshop first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/1999-0
06:08:31.700 --> 06:08:33.900
<v Ricky Horton>That's where you set up your shots.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2000-0
06:08:34.860 --> 06:08:37.580
<v Ricky Horton>And your different work areas.
Can we set up work areas?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2001-0
06:08:38.660 --> 06:08:43.133
<v Ricky Horton>OK, OK, that's cool. close this and then,
yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2001-1
06:08:43.133 --> 06:08:46.860
<v Ricky Horton>go to go to the part of the maintenance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2002-0
06:08:48.500 --> 06:08:54.020
<v Ricky Horton>One of the things we were trying to do is
try to run schedules by days.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2003-0
06:08:55.140 --> 06:08:59.547
<v Ricky Horton>So that certain bays just didn't move
because they had long term projects in it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2003-1
06:08:59.547 --> 06:09:00.580
<v Ricky Horton>certain bays moved.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2004-0
06:09:01.780 --> 06:09:05.636
<v Ricky Horton>You could essentially do that here.
So yeah, right here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2004-1
06:09:05.636 --> 06:09:10.032
<v Ricky Horton>like handling is set for 60 hours a week
and then cut saw at 60,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2004-2
06:09:10.032 --> 06:09:13.820
<v Ricky Horton>so on and so forth.
So you you can build that out here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2004-3
06:09:13.820 --> 06:09:17.540
<v Ricky Horton>You can build multiple shifts if you want
and whatnot.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2005-0
06:09:18.100 --> 06:09:22.329
<v Ricky Horton>In different work areas.
So like you can have if that is in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2005-1
06:09:22.329 --> 06:09:27.261
<v Ricky Horton>multiple bays, you can do work here.
It needs to have different bays.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2005-2
06:09:27.261 --> 06:09:32.688
<v Ricky Horton>Like I was a shot a couple weeks ago.
I was really having work in their shop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2005-3
06:09:32.688 --> 06:09:37.620
<v Ricky Horton>about which bays at the end of the last
time you guys have got to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2006-0
06:09:37.820 --> 06:09:41.267
<v Ricky Horton>Acid even so they we set up a different
phase. So yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2006-1
06:09:41.267 --> 06:09:43.420
<v Ricky Horton>it's real time against the wanding.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2007-0
06:09:44.620 --> 06:09:47.963
<v Ricky Horton>It is.
It doesn't really look at the hours that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2007-1
06:09:47.963 --> 06:09:52.142
<v Ricky Horton>you have been work.
It's looking at pieces that are done so</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2007-2
06:09:52.142 --> 06:09:56.529
<v Ricky Horton>to whether it's closed down.
So it's not even looking at this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2007-3
06:09:56.529 --> 06:09:59.872
<v Ricky Horton>This schedule is not even looking at the
hours,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2007-4
06:09:59.872 --> 06:10:03.980
<v Ricky Horton>it's looking at the hours planning for
some your capacity.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2008-0
06:10:04.260 --> 06:10:07.176
<v Ricky Horton>But whatever you work is whatever you
work,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2008-1
06:10:07.176 --> 06:10:10.820
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's just planning the work that's
never done so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2009-0
06:10:15.060 --> 06:10:19.131
<v Ricky Horton>So the plan is man hours or the plan is
pieces plan is it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2009-1
06:10:19.131 --> 06:10:24.720
<v Ricky Horton>It could be done by man hours or orphans
and you could and you could set both of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2009-2
06:10:24.720 --> 06:10:28.860
<v Ricky Horton>them up and talk between the two so you
can see either one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2010-0
06:10:31.300 --> 06:10:33.860
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, our intention and it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2011-0
06:10:34.620 --> 06:10:35.500
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2012-0
06:10:37.220 --> 06:10:39.620
<v Ricky Horton>Because our word package is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2013-0
06:10:40.580 --> 06:10:47.240
<v Ricky Horton>To build this to populate the hours in
here and then go into the selection</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2013-1
06:10:47.240 --> 06:10:54.077
<v Ricky Horton>planner and drop these work packages in
by week and we can see how resources</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2013-2
06:10:54.077 --> 06:10:57.540
<v Ricky Horton>begin to get to use the hours that are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2014-0
06:10:57.540 --> 06:10:59.500
<v Ricky Horton>Mobile.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2015-0
06:11:02.300 --> 06:11:04.300
<v Ricky Horton>Well, and that's why I would be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2016-0
06:11:05.860 --> 06:11:08.996
<v Ricky Horton>Really nice to get it linked up to
estimating,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2016-1
06:11:08.996 --> 06:11:14.333
<v Ricky Horton>get it linked linked up to estimating.
So there's an average to show up in here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2016-2
06:11:14.333 --> 06:11:18.136
<v Ricky Horton>without somebody,
I guess Mark or somebody having to sit</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2016-3
06:11:18.136 --> 06:11:22.139
<v Ricky Horton>there and say, well,
what kind of split do I think this is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2016-4
06:11:22.139 --> 06:11:23.540
<v Ricky Horton>you know, estimating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2017-0
06:11:24.300 --> 06:11:30.123
<v Ricky Horton>And what was the toggle that says this is
a likely job to land or because obviously</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2017-1
06:11:30.123 --> 06:11:34.907
<v Ricky Horton>you know all of them. Yeah,
but the way they built this initially it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2017-2
06:11:34.907 --> 06:11:39.620
<v Ricky Horton>was only work that you had released.
Now they've got it dealt with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2018-0
06:11:39.660 --> 06:11:44.898
<v Ricky Horton>With where it's like I've been waiting at
this job and I don't have as many hours</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2018-1
06:11:44.898 --> 06:11:50.071
<v Ricky Horton>in this time frame and then as releases.
So I'll put that on the schedule so you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2018-2
06:11:50.071 --> 06:11:55.117
<v Ricky Horton>know to plan for it and but as you get
releases it, it reduces that plan work,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2018-3
06:11:55.117 --> 06:11:55.500
<v Ricky Horton>right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2020-0
06:11:55.500 --> 06:11:58.741
<v Ricky Horton>So it it will take those hours and reduce
it there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2020-1
06:11:58.741 --> 06:12:03.975
<v Ricky Horton>But so let's say you've got your released
work and let's say you've got your landed</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2020-2
06:12:03.975 --> 06:12:08.524
<v Ricky Horton>work, which is the released yet,
but it's coming and now you want to say</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2020-3
06:12:08.524 --> 06:12:10.580
<v Ricky Horton>if I take this job, what happens?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2021-0
06:12:10.940 --> 06:12:16.193
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you can do that. Yeah.
So you can put in a future job as a what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2021-1
06:12:16.193 --> 06:12:19.945
<v Ricky Horton>if somebody did and put it in there and
say, hey,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2021-2
06:12:19.945 --> 06:12:25.423
<v Ricky Horton>what does this do for me ever that kind
of thing? Yeah, it's gonna cool.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2021-3
06:12:25.423 --> 06:12:30.300
<v Ricky Horton>We have to do that in Microsoft Project.
It's a pain in the ***.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2022-0
06:12:30.300 --> 06:12:34.794
<v Ricky Horton>Because you're going in through schedule
leveling and then you level some and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2022-1
06:12:34.794 --> 06:12:38.596
<v Ricky Horton>they'll level others and and somehow I
have to kill myself. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2022-2
06:12:38.596 --> 06:12:42.513
<v Ricky Horton>this doesn't do type of leveling.
So it's not going to be like, OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2022-3
06:12:42.513 --> 06:12:46.660
<v Ricky Horton>I can schedule four times to work,
four times my capacity if I want to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2023-0
06:12:47.100 --> 06:12:51.633
<v Ricky Horton>It's not going to level it for you.
It's going to force you to make those</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2023-1
06:12:51.633 --> 06:12:55.553
<v Ricky Horton>decisions for it, you know, so,
which is good in a lot of ways,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2023-2
06:12:55.553 --> 06:12:59.534
<v Ricky Horton>but always too, right?
So my role is always to take a lot of the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2023-3
06:12:59.534 --> 06:13:04.434
<v Ricky Horton>future and easy work. If it's hard work,
you better think about it really hard,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2023-4
06:13:04.434 --> 06:13:04.740
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2024-0
06:13:05.140 --> 06:13:08.693
<v Ricky Horton>In in in this industry, it's hard to say,
OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2024-1
06:13:08.693 --> 06:13:13.171
<v Ricky Horton>just let all this happen because
everything works, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2024-2
06:13:13.171 --> 06:13:16.260
<v Ricky Horton>Let it all work and it should be OK, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2025-0
06:13:18.380 --> 06:13:22.014
<v Ricky Horton>No,
these probably need to be adjusted</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2025-1
06:13:22.014 --> 06:13:29.189
<v Ricky Horton>because when we set this up in July,
we have a different amount of employees</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2025-2
06:13:29.189 --> 06:13:34.220
<v Ricky Horton>to get in July.
Are you having to use this at all or?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2026-0
06:13:34.340 --> 06:13:39.446
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty much said nothing and then
whatever. Yeah, that's what we did.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2026-1
06:13:39.446 --> 06:13:45.427
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean, we can run with it right now,
now that it's at and then once Mark gets</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2026-2
06:13:45.427 --> 06:13:48.564
<v Ricky Horton>in here,
we can kind of go through of like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2026-3
06:13:48.564 --> 06:13:49.220
<v Ricky Horton>handling.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2027-0
06:13:49.820 --> 06:13:55.359
<v Ricky Horton>I guess 60 hours a week. I mean,
I guess you're not handling movie. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2027-1
06:13:55.359 --> 06:13:59.026
<v Ricky Horton>the channel's there too.
It's in order for that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2027-2
06:13:59.026 --> 06:14:04.340
<v Ricky Horton>instead you got to have a station for it.
That's right. And it's like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2028-0
06:14:04.860 --> 06:14:09.127
<v Ricky Horton>It's not like you're processing the
handling station for a job,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2028-1
06:14:09.127 --> 06:14:12.260
<v Ricky Horton>so it's hard to have that on the schedule,
so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2029-0
06:14:13.780 --> 06:14:18.141
<v Ricky Horton>But for me, I only ever looked at it.
That's it. Well, yeah, I was like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2029-1
06:14:18.141 --> 06:14:21.068
<v Ricky Horton>handling,
we'll we'll get more people to do this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2029-2
06:14:21.068 --> 06:14:22.740
<v Ricky Horton>stuff right now. Yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2030-0
06:14:27.580 --> 06:14:30.953
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you know,
we can always cut it because cutting and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2030-1
06:14:30.953 --> 06:14:34.740
<v Ricky Horton>the subcontract cutting was not even
about Oregon either, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2031-0
06:14:39.020 --> 06:14:43.780
<v Ricky Horton>So go back to your work packages and read
the planner up again then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2032-0
06:14:44.860 --> 06:14:48.260
<v Ricky Horton>Or you can get it right down to 12.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-0
06:14:58.620 --> 06:15:01.316
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.
So the idea is you got week by week here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-1
06:15:01.316 --> 06:15:05.535
<v Ricky Horton>and then you're able to pull these
packages over and drop it in a week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-2
06:15:05.535 --> 06:15:09.285
<v Ricky Horton>Then when you do that,
it's got a breakdown of the of the hours</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-3
06:15:09.285 --> 06:15:12.157
<v Ricky Horton>by department.
So you go to the department view,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-4
06:15:12.157 --> 06:15:16.376
<v Ricky Horton>which is up there next to the Riggs
workshop before, yeah, or that way,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2033-5
06:15:16.376 --> 06:15:17.020
<v Ricky Horton>either way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2034-0
06:15:17.660 --> 06:15:19.860
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the little square up there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2035-0
06:15:22.380 --> 06:15:25.620
<v Ricky Horton>So now we got a breakout by the part of
here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2038-0
06:15:32.300 --> 06:15:38.789
<v Ricky Horton>What are we looking at there on?
So is that a day by day? That's a week,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2038-1
06:15:38.789 --> 06:15:44.300
<v Ricky Horton>a week over there, yeah.
And then so in that week there's the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2038-2
06:15:44.300 --> 06:15:48.300
<v Ricky Horton>packages for cuts all the packages for
burn.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-0
06:15:48.300 --> 06:15:51.159
<v Ricky Horton>And then you're like,
is this actually working? So like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-1
06:15:51.159 --> 06:15:54.921
<v Ricky Horton>when you first drop it into a week,
it's probably going to drop, cut, saw,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-2
06:15:54.921 --> 06:15:58.933
<v Ricky Horton>burn, everything all in the same week,
right? Well, that's not going to happen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-3
06:15:58.933 --> 06:16:02.695
<v Ricky Horton>You got to cut it before you fit it.
You got to fit it before you weld it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-4
06:16:02.695 --> 06:16:04.751
<v Ricky Horton>right?
So then you might be moving these</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2039-5
06:16:04.751 --> 06:16:07.860
<v Ricky Horton>packages around to say, OK, cool,
we're cutting it this week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2040-0
06:16:08.220 --> 06:16:12.949
<v Ricky Horton>And burning it this week,
but fit well are going to be next week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2040-1
06:16:12.949 --> 06:16:19.039
<v Ricky Horton>So you pull those down into the following
week or something like that. So it is not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2040-2
06:16:19.039 --> 06:16:24.340
<v Ricky Horton>So in project you can have same star,
you know, after it's finished star.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2041-0
06:16:24.700 --> 06:16:31.806
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's that's the reference.
This is a game chart platform like that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2041-1
06:16:31.806 --> 06:16:38.912
<v Ricky Horton>which there is a game chart platform in
here, but not not on this schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2041-2
06:16:38.912 --> 06:16:39.660
<v Ricky Horton>This is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2042-0
06:16:39.740 --> 06:16:43.980
<v Ricky Horton>This is very,
very much you have to think through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2043-0
06:16:45.180 --> 06:16:49.700
<v Ricky Horton>What's known we have so and it's not
gonna label that out for me so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2044-0
06:16:51.900 --> 06:16:55.660
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
what I'm hearing is it's a very manual</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2044-1
06:16:55.660 --> 06:17:02.060
<v Ricky Horton>way of putting blocks and packages in
different places and then if you fill the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2044-2
06:17:02.060 --> 06:17:07.740
<v Ricky Horton>bucket up, you better move, adjust it,
adjust it. Yep, it is, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2045-0
06:17:08.020 --> 06:17:13.260
<v Ricky Horton>Project will be faster then. Well,
you're totally disconnected from the from</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2045-1
06:17:13.260 --> 06:17:16.731
<v Ricky Horton>the data.
So this actually does work well when you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2045-2
06:17:16.731 --> 06:17:21.427
<v Ricky Horton>when you start working with it,
especially I think with the packages</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2045-3
06:17:21.427 --> 06:17:23.740
<v Ricky Horton>you're putting out there, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2046-0
06:17:23.820 --> 06:17:29.628
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think you're moving it around and
you do a drug. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2046-1
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:34.422
<v Ricky Horton>especially the stuff we've been having
now. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2046-2
06:17:34.422 --> 06:17:39.860
<v Ricky Horton>it's 150 total dollar package,
$200 package like this TMC.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2047-0
06:17:40.220 --> 06:17:44.908
<v Ricky Horton>Fab three,
that one's 21 and almost 2200 hours, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2047-1
06:17:44.908 --> 06:17:51.765
<v Ricky Horton>So that one will be a little bit more.
And that one I'm probably gonna release</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2047-2
06:17:51.765 --> 06:17:57.580
<v Ricky Horton>to the shop Monday of next week and we
have to have it done by 12.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-0
06:17:58.060 --> 06:18:02.106
<v Ricky Horton>The the advantage here is, yeah,
I might have to drag that down to another</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-1
06:18:02.106 --> 06:18:04.480
<v Ricky Horton>week,
but I don't have to build the project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-2
06:18:04.480 --> 06:18:07.393
<v Ricky Horton>over there.
I don't have to build the schedule out of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-3
06:18:07.393 --> 06:18:10.522
<v Ricky Horton>Microsoft Project.
I don't have to build the the job out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-4
06:18:10.522 --> 06:18:13.112
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have to build the hours out over
there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2048-5
06:18:13.112 --> 06:18:16.780
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have to do any of that stuff
manually in Microsoft Project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2049-0
06:18:16.900 --> 06:18:20.780
<v Ricky Horton>That's why nothing there.
That's that's a little, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2050-0
06:18:21.740 --> 06:18:27.302
<v Ricky Horton>So you're saying what,
12th of January you have to be done?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2050-1
06:18:27.302 --> 06:18:34.439
<v Ricky Horton>And then so you're basically giving
yourself 15 days more or less to produce</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2050-2
06:18:34.439 --> 06:18:35.180
<v Ricky Horton>369,000?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2051-0
06:18:36.860 --> 06:18:39.860
<v Ricky Horton>Well, really, 2200 hours, Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2052-0
06:18:43.300 --> 06:18:43.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2053-0
06:18:45.780 --> 06:18:47.340
<v Ricky Horton>Do you work here in tents?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2054-0
06:18:48.420 --> 06:18:52.620
<v Ricky Horton>And um, unless the work has justified.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2055-0
06:18:54.060 --> 06:19:01.105
<v Ricky Horton>So are you have a 1493? Yeah,
that's one of the. Sure, you've got 20,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2055-1
06:19:01.105 --> 06:19:03.620
<v Ricky Horton>any photo holidays? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2056-0
06:19:05.420 --> 06:19:06.340
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe more.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2057-0
06:19:07.100 --> 06:19:13.672
<v Ricky Horton>Do you think that's hard for you to do
2200 hours by then? No, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2057-1
06:19:13.672 --> 06:19:17.688
<v Ricky Horton>I think it'll be good. Honestly,
I I think,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2057-2
06:19:17.688 --> 06:19:23.620
<v Ricky Horton>I think it'll be cause that will be other
projects that will be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2058-0
06:19:24.060 --> 06:19:26.180
<v Ricky Horton>So what's your trouble about, you know?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2059-0
06:19:29.220 --> 06:19:35.374
<v Ricky Horton>Literally nothing. I see. Yeah,
the only work that we have is whatever</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2059-1
06:19:35.374 --> 06:19:39.880
<v Ricky Horton>would be Mark.
It was more than what we have to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2059-2
06:19:39.880 --> 06:19:45.860
<v Ricky Horton>I see. Really, this is only 100 jobs.
I mean, jobs coming from them.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2060-0
06:19:46.140 --> 06:19:53.383
<v Ricky Horton>Almost never. Almost never.
The only job we're winning is the job</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2060-1
06:19:53.383 --> 06:20:00.187
<v Ricky Horton>that I'm estimating insecurity. Oh,
the 4% job we're getting,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2060-2
06:20:00.187 --> 06:20:02.820
<v Ricky Horton>they're not coming from.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2061-0
06:20:03.180 --> 06:20:08.536
<v Ricky Horton>Karaman, they're coming to you.
I haven't even seen Karaman.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2061-1
06:20:08.536 --> 06:20:14.858
<v Ricky Horton>I just heard that number for a crowd.
96% of the work that's, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2061-2
06:20:14.858 --> 06:20:20.740
<v Ricky Horton>I'm shot from me and Mark estimating
reaching out to our contacts.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2062-0
06:20:21.260 --> 06:20:27.780
<v Ricky Horton>That's a great planning to tell me and I
can't remember the estimated field jobs</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2062-1
06:20:27.780 --> 06:20:32.690
<v Ricky Horton>too. Yeah, they're estimated field jobs.
They're estimating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2062-2
06:20:32.690 --> 06:20:37.358
<v Ricky Horton>They're they're doing it all the
estimating for anything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2062-3
06:20:37.358 --> 06:20:41.060
<v Ricky Horton>Me and Mark are getting,
we get over to over.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2063-0
06:20:41.260 --> 06:20:46.900
<v Ricky Horton>You know, over for work for Sahuaro,
you guys just have it on the over for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2063-1
06:20:46.900 --> 06:20:51.112
<v Ricky Horton>work, big shots and yeah,
you're working with that son,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2063-2
06:20:51.112 --> 06:20:54.420
<v Ricky Horton>you know they're going back and down,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2064-0
06:20:55.500 --> 06:20:59.082
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine, but it's over.
That's the way for the country.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2064-1
06:20:59.082 --> 06:21:03.022
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I'm asking.
That's what I was going to be asking your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2064-2
06:21:03.022 --> 06:21:05.828
<v Ricky Horton>question, but then your answer. Yeah,
they do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2064-3
06:21:05.828 --> 06:21:10.903
<v Ricky Horton>But they give their plan for all the over
over the whole United States or just here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2064-4
06:21:10.903 --> 06:21:11.380
<v Ricky Horton>however.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2065-0
06:21:11.700 --> 06:21:16.016
<v Ricky Horton>So the the stuff that it's for all around
the country.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2065-1
06:21:16.016 --> 06:21:21.274
<v Ricky Horton>Are they getting jobs for going to the
other parts of the country?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2065-2
06:21:21.274 --> 06:21:24.020
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds like it. Yeah. Oh, OK, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2066-0
06:21:27.060 --> 06:21:30.660
<v Ricky Horton>So the overall win rate though is 4%.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2067-0
06:21:32.620 --> 06:21:35.234
<v Ricky Horton>You deal with that if you do.
If you got a less,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2067-1
06:21:35.234 --> 06:21:36.940
<v Ricky Horton>you're getting enough jobs, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2068-0
06:21:37.900 --> 06:21:43.041
<v Ricky Horton>If we're trying to make it really big,
do you feel better?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2068-1
06:21:43.041 --> 06:21:49.315
<v Ricky Horton>That's the that's things are electrical.
I mean there's a big one, $50,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2068-2
06:21:49.315 --> 06:21:55.502
<v Ricky Horton>000 and and then you know at the same
timeline we want one $50 million</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2068-3
06:21:55.502 --> 06:21:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>electrical.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2069-0
06:21:56.500 --> 06:22:00.872
<v Ricky Horton>So,
but I I don't really know what's going on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2069-1
06:22:00.872 --> 06:22:07.144
<v Ricky Horton>back on that. But yeah,
it's been me and Mark this entire year if</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2069-2
06:22:07.144 --> 06:22:11.420
<v Ricky Horton>there's been a job in the shop,
me and Mark.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2071-0
06:22:11.820 --> 06:22:19.560
<v Ricky Horton>Sort it out, put a number against it.
So and it's all the stuff I've estimated.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2071-1
06:22:19.560 --> 06:22:27.687
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of our a lot of our numbers that
are right on are Mark's landual take-off,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2071-2
06:22:27.687 --> 06:22:31.460
<v Ricky Horton>just my tech will take off and then us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2072-0
06:22:31.540 --> 06:22:38.167
<v Ricky Horton>Or to retrieve that for us and because we
can't rely on estimating department.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2072-1
06:22:38.167 --> 06:22:44.542
<v Ricky Horton>So what's going on with the jobs like the
water treatment plants and stuff?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2072-2
06:22:44.542 --> 06:22:48.820
<v Ricky Horton>Who got those jobs?
These are estimating those up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2073-0
06:22:49.060 --> 06:22:55.000
<v Ricky Horton>The PDE are doing it themselves or which
you want to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2073-1
06:22:55.000 --> 06:23:01.981
<v Ricky Horton>What kind of work are we doing now?
Honestly, this stuff. It must.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2073-2
06:23:01.981 --> 06:23:05.940
<v Ricky Horton>Mostly we happened. I said that maybe.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2074-0
06:23:06.260 --> 06:23:14.069
<v Ricky Horton>Camrails and canopies and graphic. Yeah,
camrails, canopies, swing rails, batters,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2074-1
06:23:14.069 --> 06:23:19.620
<v Ricky Horton>fence, man ways,
and the PDS are are they using tech load?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2075-0
06:23:20.580 --> 06:23:26.692
<v Ricky Horton>This is where a lot of them are using
previous data,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2075-1
06:23:26.692 --> 06:23:35.917
<v Ricky Horton>so so they'll take a lot of believe we
fabricated this like 36243648 inch rams.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2075-2
06:23:35.917 --> 06:23:37.300
<v Ricky Horton>We've got a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2076-0
06:23:37.460 --> 06:23:43.397
<v Ricky Horton>We've done so many of those that they
know what we're going to throw 30 hours</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2076-1
06:23:43.397 --> 06:23:49.714
<v Ricky Horton>in there and we're going to do 1500 bucks
in cost of materials and we need four of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2076-2
06:23:49.714 --> 06:23:53.900
<v Ricky Horton>them for this project.
It's all very surprising to me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2077-0
06:23:54.180 --> 06:24:00.238
<v Ricky Horton>You know, it's hard to make.
It's hard to make a lot of money going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2077-1
06:24:00.238 --> 06:24:05.016
<v Ricky Horton>hospital jobs.
I think you can wear yourself with that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2077-2
06:24:05.016 --> 06:24:11.500
<v Ricky Horton>especially if it all shows up at you,
you know, like $10,000 jobs over one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2078-0
06:24:11.860 --> 06:24:16.858
<v Ricky Horton>Five million more jobs.
It takes a whole bunch of time to manage</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2078-1
06:24:16.858 --> 06:24:20.934
<v Ricky Horton>those 10100,000 jobs. Yeah, yeah,
a whole bunch. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2078-2
06:24:20.934 --> 06:24:26.700
<v Ricky Horton>like I can manage a three to five million
jobs, the same amount, you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2079-0
06:24:27.060 --> 06:24:28.500
<v Ricky Horton>I want you to take.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2080-0
06:24:29.540 --> 06:24:34.660
<v Ricky Horton>It was under 100. Yeah, it better be 50%.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2081-0
06:24:35.620 --> 06:24:40.640
<v Ricky Horton>I think this is a packed habit because
otherwise it's not worth disrupting your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2081-1
06:24:40.640 --> 06:24:42.020
<v Ricky Horton>regular open business.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2082-0
06:24:44.260 --> 06:24:47.406
<v Ricky Horton>I'm scratching my head trying to figure
out some stuff.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2082-1
06:24:47.406 --> 06:24:49.540
<v Ricky Horton>Some of this stuff ain't have nothing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2083-0
06:24:51.580 --> 06:24:55.124
<v Ricky Horton>But Lowen Rd.
to spot these guys in January, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2083-1
06:24:55.124 --> 06:24:59.282
<v Ricky Horton>Big master grand plan or something.
We're not worried. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2083-2
06:24:59.282 --> 06:25:04.189
<v Ricky Horton>they just said that last night, right?
Did you guys see the grand plan?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2083-3
06:25:04.189 --> 06:25:07.801
<v Ricky Horton>I did see that. Yeah,
we're doing everything in red,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2083-4
06:25:07.801 --> 06:25:11.140
<v Ricky Horton>white and blue and this and then I got
all that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2084-0
06:25:11.300 --> 06:25:15.020
<v Ricky Horton>That's good, buddy.
Where did I got one of the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2085-0
06:25:17.740 --> 06:25:18.060
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2086-0
06:25:19.460 --> 06:25:21.740
<v Ricky Horton>But may I do my work?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2087-0
06:25:23.060 --> 06:25:27.243
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
when we're supposed to be the the shining</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2087-1
06:25:27.243 --> 06:25:33.951
<v Ricky Horton>star template for all the other shops.
So we're supposed to refine our tech,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2087-2
06:25:33.951 --> 06:25:40.660
<v Ricky Horton>get everything filed in and do it there.
I like that idea. That makes sense.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2088-0
06:25:41.540 --> 06:25:41.740
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2089-0
06:25:43.340 --> 06:25:48.890
<v Ricky Horton>But me and Mark don't actively working
for work looking for work, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2089-1
06:25:48.890 --> 06:25:54.878
<v Ricky Horton>3-4 days and best and and then we'd still
get a random package dropped in our lab</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2089-2
06:25:54.878 --> 06:26:00.500
<v Ricky Horton>and then ask what we're doing like we're
doing kind of jobs that we can get.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2090-0
06:26:01.740 --> 06:26:01.980
<v Ricky Horton>Well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2091-0
06:26:04.100 --> 06:26:07.851
<v Ricky Horton>That's the that's the thing. I mean,
you can do so much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2091-1
06:26:07.851 --> 06:26:13.379
<v Ricky Horton>There's so many different things. I mean,
even even with even with the stuff we get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2091-2
06:26:13.379 --> 06:26:17.788
<v Ricky Horton>from the next level, I mean,
we're doing heavy structural work for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2091-3
06:26:17.788 --> 06:26:20.420
<v Ricky Horton>W&amp;W through the next level and yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2092-0
06:26:20.860 --> 06:26:24.954
<v Ricky Horton>And I mean,
one of our biggest constraints is I get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2092-1
06:26:24.954 --> 06:26:31.330
<v Ricky Horton>all those big materials and then I have
to get those subbed out process and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2092-2
06:26:31.330 --> 06:26:35.580
<v Ricky Horton>they come back in and then they can fit
in well, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2093-0
06:26:36.340 --> 06:26:41.844
<v Ricky Horton>Otherwise,
anything over 30 inches were buoying</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2093-1
06:26:41.844 --> 06:26:47.463
<v Ricky Horton>cuttings,
and anything over 30 inches were being</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2093-2
06:26:47.463 --> 06:26:50.100
<v Ricky Horton>more level line on our.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2094-0
06:26:51.980 --> 06:26:54.860
<v Ricky Horton>Does this just take through that?
Thank you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2095-0
06:26:55.980 --> 06:27:03.673
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of a lot of refining to be done,
but I I I think you think that the tech</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2095-1
06:27:03.673 --> 06:27:09.020
<v Ricky Horton>way is going to help.
I'm not as worried about that now.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2096-0
06:27:11.460 --> 06:27:14.852
<v Ricky Horton>I have jobs, I have equipment. Yeah,
you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2096-1
06:27:14.852 --> 06:27:20.263
<v Ricky Horton>it's like if they're going to go to all
the struggle to get with big jobs,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2096-2
06:27:20.263 --> 06:27:26.108
<v Ricky Horton>they've got to have a method of doing it
and it's just going to be they're going</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2096-3
06:27:26.108 --> 06:27:30.220
<v Ricky Horton>to buy farming.
I just want to get a shuttle management.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2097-0
06:27:30.500 --> 06:27:36.220
<v Ricky Horton>She had a mill map that you can go.
Call your call, your beam line work here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2097-1
06:27:36.220 --> 06:27:40.840
<v Ricky Horton>this work over here.
We're going to do a little bit of welding</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2097-2
06:27:40.840 --> 06:27:44.800
<v Ricky Horton>here. Send the pack. I guess. OK,
now that I've been,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2097-3
06:27:44.800 --> 06:27:48.100
<v Ricky Horton>I get a sense that there's X amount of
fuel.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2098-0
06:27:49.260 --> 06:27:53.980
<v Ricky Horton>Right. And I say, OK,
in X amount of field work we're seeing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2099-0
06:27:55.540 --> 06:28:03.340
<v Ricky Horton>Packages of fab. There's this one thought.
Let's grab more of those packages itself.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2100-0
06:28:04.460 --> 06:28:07.049
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
There's the other one that says in order</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2100-1
06:28:07.049 --> 06:28:10.442
<v Ricky Horton>to self perform,
you got to have the equipment to do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2100-2
06:28:10.442 --> 06:28:14.296
<v Ricky Horton>You're actually going to self perform,
right? I think they're not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2100-3
06:28:14.296 --> 06:28:18.610
<v Ricky Horton>I think they're going to buy a certain
portion of that. I'm curious. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2100-4
06:28:18.610 --> 06:28:19.300
<v Ricky Horton>I'm curious.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2101-0
06:28:20.020 --> 06:28:20.300
<v Ricky Horton>1.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2102-0
06:28:21.220 --> 06:28:22.380
<v Ricky Horton>I would just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2103-0
06:28:23.700 --> 06:28:26.060
<v Ricky Horton>Look at it. You know I would do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2104-0
06:28:27.140 --> 06:28:30.249
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
nobody really analyzes until Jeff came</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2104-1
06:28:30.249 --> 06:28:34.119
<v Ricky Horton>here. Jeff's also analyzing.
That's why I know these things,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2104-2
06:28:34.119 --> 06:28:38.179
<v Ricky Horton>because he's told me.
But I think Chris and Jarrod kind of were</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2104-3
06:28:38.179 --> 06:28:42.620
<v Ricky Horton>like, oh, we're only winning 4%,
but they didn't really realize that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2105-0
06:28:43.060 --> 06:28:48.116
<v Ricky Horton>And so now the next thing is to me is
categorize what are we winning and what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2105-1
06:28:48.116 --> 06:28:51.682
<v Ricky Horton>are we losing?
Or are we losing a lot of stuff that we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2105-2
06:28:51.682 --> 06:28:56.738
<v Ricky Horton>could add a half million dollar piece of
equipment to win more of that? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2105-3
06:28:56.738 --> 06:28:57.580
<v Ricky Horton>I understand.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2106-0
06:28:58.980 --> 06:29:03.330
<v Ricky Horton>But I think stepping into the world of
Bechtel is like 3 steps away.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2106-1
06:29:03.330 --> 06:29:07.933
<v Ricky Horton>First we got to take one step.
They're they're thinking they're going to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2106-2
06:29:07.933 --> 06:29:12.976
<v Ricky Horton>get the Bechtel job because of the time
constraint and they're going to be at a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2106-3
06:29:12.976 --> 06:29:14.300
<v Ricky Horton>higher profit margin.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2107-0
06:29:14.420 --> 06:29:17.960
<v Ricky Horton>Because the other,
the other companies bidding it arguably</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2107-1
06:29:17.960 --> 06:29:21.200
<v Ricky Horton>at the time,
we can cram it together and equipment to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2107-2
06:29:21.200 --> 06:29:24.320
<v Ricky Horton>different places.
I think that's what they that's a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2107-3
06:29:24.320 --> 06:29:28.580
<v Ricky Horton>straction. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
Problem is all the other places are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2107-4
06:29:28.580 --> 06:29:29.420
<v Ricky Horton>actually busy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2108-0
06:29:29.620 --> 06:29:32.935
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it was a guarantee that they got to stay</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2108-1
06:29:32.935 --> 06:29:36.672
<v Ricky Horton>at the game too,
but cause I reached the steel beds.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2108-2
06:29:36.672 --> 06:29:40.832
<v Ricky Horton>Steel bed's busier in common.
They got backlog like crazy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2108-3
06:29:40.832 --> 06:29:43.300
<v Ricky Horton>They always got backlog like crazy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2109-0
06:29:45.740 --> 06:29:51.034
<v Ricky Horton>Large majority of our be mine work is
Saguaro.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2109-1
06:29:51.034 --> 06:29:59.820
<v Ricky Horton>Usually they are really pricey and all
this and all this out. Are they? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2110-0
06:30:00.340 --> 06:30:07.299
<v Ricky Horton>I got to send my TSMC stuff over to them
before I think that's it this year. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2110-1
06:30:07.299 --> 06:30:11.324
<v Ricky Horton>I gotta have it done.
I try to do it this year,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2110-2
06:30:11.324 --> 06:30:15.180
<v Ricky Horton>so so let's say they make a good job back
to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2111-0
06:30:15.740 --> 06:30:18.938
<v Ricky Horton>Who are they going to throw all that
stuff out to?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2111-1
06:30:18.938 --> 06:30:23.577
<v Ricky Horton>Remember that the release date is not
till November of next year. I know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2111-2
06:30:23.577 --> 06:30:27.590
<v Ricky Horton>but they got a certain portion of work
has to be done by March,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2111-3
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:31.790
<v Ricky Horton>March of the following year.
So the following year 2027, 2027. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2111-4
06:30:31.790 --> 06:30:33.420
<v Ricky Horton>this is way in the future.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2112-0
06:30:33.900 --> 06:30:37.049
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I don't know if everybody else realizes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2112-1
06:30:37.049 --> 06:30:42.046
<v Ricky Horton>that, but if you look at the schedule,
so they can do it then, then why?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2112-2
06:30:42.046 --> 06:30:47.180
<v Ricky Horton>Why are the standard team mining
companies not big enough? Maybe they are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2113-0
06:30:49.140 --> 06:30:52.610
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, if it's near and halfway,
they can certainly do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2113-1
06:30:52.610 --> 06:30:56.200
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't think so.
And I think there may be a little bit</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2113-2
06:30:56.200 --> 06:30:59.061
<v Ricky Horton>confusing that this has worked for this
March,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2113-3
06:30:59.061 --> 06:31:03.808
<v Ricky Horton>it has worked for next March and the
packages are not going to be ready until</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2113-4
06:31:03.808 --> 06:31:04.660
<v Ricky Horton>next November.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2114-0
06:31:06.300 --> 06:31:10.008
<v Ricky Horton>That's why you only have 81 days and
about 7000 sons.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2114-1
06:31:10.008 --> 06:31:15.226
<v Ricky Horton>There's the time constraint is then it's
not because it's having parts that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2114-2
06:31:15.226 --> 06:31:18.728
<v Ricky Horton>they're going to,
but it's still next to a member.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2114-3
06:31:18.728 --> 06:31:24.220
<v Ricky Horton>So it's still very tight fabrication,
you know, so that's why they're thinking.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2115-0
06:31:24.420 --> 06:31:28.869
<v Ricky Horton>We're in the pump again.
We we can't in the Bectel scope of work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2115-1
06:31:28.869 --> 06:31:33.251
<v Ricky Horton>Bectel deserves the right to award
packages at different values.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2115-2
06:31:33.251 --> 06:31:35.340
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have a split expect.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2116-0
06:31:37.100 --> 06:31:37.260
<v Ricky Horton>With.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2117-0
06:31:38.660 --> 06:31:44.356
<v Ricky Horton>So what's your questions here?
I think you're set up this road,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2117-1
06:31:44.356 --> 06:31:49.963
<v Ricky Horton>but what's what's the?
I guess our biggest questions were like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2117-2
06:31:49.963 --> 06:31:53.700
<v Ricky Horton>on future work is essentially the goal is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2118-0
06:31:54.300 --> 06:31:54.380
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2119-0
06:31:58.580 --> 06:32:02.913
<v Ricky Horton>Christie wants us in codings to be able
to go, OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2119-1
06:32:02.913 --> 06:32:09.709
<v Ricky Horton>we've got a project that we got awarded.
This is all the work we have active in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2119-2
06:32:09.709 --> 06:32:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>the shop and it's scheduled out.
We got a new project awarded.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2120-0
06:32:15.100 --> 06:32:21.211
<v Ricky Horton>And we want to try and plug that one in
the other system or even theoretical</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2120-1
06:32:21.211 --> 06:32:26.846
<v Ricky Horton>something that's not ordered,
but we do not potential this many hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2120-2
06:32:26.846 --> 06:32:30.020
<v Ricky Horton>How do we plug that kind of stuff in so?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2122-0
06:32:30.460 --> 06:32:36.046
<v Ricky Horton>It would be a a bit hard considering you
still have to have the job number in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2122-1
06:32:36.046 --> 06:32:41.345
<v Ricky Horton>there and something that's not,
it's just going to money in the system or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2122-2
06:32:41.345 --> 06:32:46.500
<v Ricky Horton>at least making up the job number. Yeah,
I mean, you might even have a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2123-0
06:32:46.860 --> 06:32:54.380
<v Ricky Horton>Fake job that's in there,
always that says you can plug in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2124-0
06:32:55.500 --> 06:33:00.723
<v Ricky Horton>So it's within tech,
but this is the production plan.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2124-1
06:33:00.723 --> 06:33:06.140
<v Ricky Horton>You've also got a dance chart.
Are they linked? No. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2124-2
06:33:06.140 --> 06:33:12.620
<v Ricky Horton>are they good to do that?
They wouldn't do it. So now there's any.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2125-0
06:33:12.700 --> 06:33:17.362
<v Ricky Horton>We might want to get over and consider
something else.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2125-1
06:33:17.362 --> 06:33:24.397
<v Ricky Horton>There is a production schedule linked to
the project schedule that could be run as</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2125-2
06:33:24.397 --> 06:33:24.820
<v Ricky Horton>well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2126-0
06:33:26.300 --> 06:33:29.928
<v Ricky Horton>So the big point,
just more even is what I want and some</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2126-1
06:33:29.928 --> 06:33:32.919
<v Ricky Horton>people just want to make 30,
000 for the year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2126-2
06:33:32.919 --> 06:33:36.993
<v Ricky Horton>And I think we looked at that production
schedule, right? Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2126-3
06:33:36.993 --> 06:33:42.020
<v Ricky Horton>So this thing only runs your week at a
time. You can't do a month or whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2127-0
06:33:42.740 --> 06:33:48.044
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, no. You guys already want.
You got five units more open. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2127-1
06:33:48.044 --> 06:33:51.853
<v Ricky Horton>only one one week to show because there's
so many.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2127-2
06:33:51.853 --> 06:33:56.260
<v Ricky Horton>You scroll down and you'll you'll see the
other weeks, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2128-0
06:33:59.660 --> 06:34:06.009
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they're in development. Got it.
Yeah. So yeah, besides this one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2128-1
06:34:06.009 --> 06:34:12.983
<v Ricky Horton>then you see there's two other. Yeah,
there's a Gantt chart one and that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2128-2
06:34:12.983 --> 06:34:16.380
<v Ricky Horton>The project schedule is a Gantt chart.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2129-0
06:34:19.060 --> 06:34:24.569
<v Ricky Horton>It's never been a Microsoft project.
I see that it's right here. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2129-1
06:34:24.569 --> 06:34:28.914
<v Ricky Horton>we're looking at.
It's what we're looking at yesterday.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2129-2
06:34:28.914 --> 06:34:31.940
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. OK, I see. Yeah. So now this can.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2130-0
06:34:32.220 --> 06:34:38.722
<v Ricky Horton>Automatically build a production schedule.
So like go to the drop down at the top</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2130-1
06:34:38.722 --> 06:34:41.100
<v Ricky Horton>and go to production schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2131-0
06:34:45.300 --> 06:34:45.900
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2132-0
06:34:48.500 --> 06:34:51.518
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
then when we got set up for resources</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2132-1
06:34:51.518 --> 06:34:52.380
<v Ricky Horton>either with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2133-0
06:34:55.260 --> 06:35:01.607
<v Ricky Horton>And then beside this, there's another one.
So this is the production schedule,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2133-1
06:35:01.607 --> 06:35:07.712
<v Ricky Horton>this length of the project schedule.
Basically it puts it out here and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2133-2
06:35:07.712 --> 06:35:13.094
<v Ricky Horton>you can scroll out to the right.
You see week by week you've got a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2133-3
06:35:13.094 --> 06:35:14.540
<v Ricky Horton>capacity like for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2134-0
06:35:14.940 --> 06:35:20.550
<v Ricky Horton>I've never seen this, really.
This is pretty cool. Yeah. And so this is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2134-1
06:35:20.550 --> 06:35:24.854
<v Ricky Horton>it's not the production schedule for your
overall shop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2134-2
06:35:24.854 --> 06:35:30.618
<v Ricky Horton>The production schedule by area on T,
by cut area, burn area and all that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2134-3
06:35:30.618 --> 06:35:34.460
<v Ricky Horton>It's just kind of what we had over there
as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2135-0
06:35:34.540 --> 06:35:38.093
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
It's been a little bit more dynamic with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2135-1
06:35:38.093 --> 06:35:42.239
<v Ricky Horton>it over there. But this,
by doing the project schedule,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2135-2
06:35:42.239 --> 06:35:46.902
<v Ricky Horton>this pretty much just creates itself.
It sprays the hours out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2135-3
06:35:46.902 --> 06:35:51.492
<v Ricky Horton>And this is only for one job. No,
for all jobs. All jobs, OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2135-4
06:35:51.492 --> 06:35:53.860
<v Ricky Horton>we we have a filter for one job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2136-0
06:35:54.060 --> 06:35:57.593
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, OK,
so can you put a dummy job in here then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2136-1
06:35:57.593 --> 06:35:59.620
<v Ricky Horton>if you want to say about, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2137-0
06:36:01.380 --> 06:36:03.220
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see like a good option.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2138-0
06:36:05.020 --> 06:36:11.159
<v Ricky Horton>Right click over there on the right or
just anywhere it says flaps off and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2138-1
06:36:11.159 --> 06:36:15.456
<v Ricky Horton>like open up or open up welder,
whichever one you want.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2138-2
06:36:15.456 --> 06:36:20.980
<v Ricky Horton>Now there's all the jobs that are
contributing to the welding resource.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2139-0
06:36:21.660 --> 06:36:28.287
<v Ricky Horton>And it would say how many hours per job
each week gets a good on that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2139-1
06:36:28.287 --> 06:36:33.420
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say I'm not these guys are running
the schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2139-2
06:36:33.420 --> 06:36:36.500
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sitting wherever I'm sitting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2140-0
06:36:36.780 --> 06:36:43.481
<v Ricky Horton>And I don't want to forecast when I had
test jobs, does it mess with their units?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2140-1
06:36:43.481 --> 06:36:50.181
<v Ricky Horton>If you put hours and stuff in there and
apply to it, then it will put it in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2140-2
06:36:50.181 --> 06:36:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but you can do a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2141-0
06:36:52.140 --> 06:36:53.940
<v Ricky Horton>You can do a um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2142-0
06:36:55.620 --> 06:37:02.290
<v Ricky Horton>It like I used to put in a paid job that
I just had a job that said what what did</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2142-1
06:37:02.290 --> 06:37:06.520
<v Ricky Horton>I call it?
It was like I think I call it estimating</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2142-2
06:37:06.520 --> 06:37:13.027
<v Ricky Horton>or something like that and I might have
50 limelines instead of working jobs we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2142-3
06:37:13.027 --> 06:37:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>might think we might get.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2143-0
06:37:15.180 --> 06:37:18.935
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm pulling in and out. I want to.
But when these guys lose their mind and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2143-1
06:37:18.935 --> 06:37:19.980
<v Ricky Horton>they see the schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-0
06:37:21.660 --> 06:37:24.481
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but I mean,
most of the time I'm going to put it in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-1
06:37:24.481 --> 06:37:27.496
<v Ricky Horton>there just to see where it is. Yeah,
you have a special name.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-2
06:37:27.496 --> 06:37:29.684
<v Ricky Horton>They just won't include that particular
one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-3
06:37:29.684 --> 06:37:33.234
<v Ricky Horton>It's not like you're going to drop
anything and leave it for two months,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-4
06:37:33.234 --> 06:37:35.277
<v Ricky Horton>right?
You don't drop it and you see what</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-5
06:37:35.277 --> 06:37:38.000
<v Ricky Horton>happens, then you don't pull it out,
right? Yeah. Well,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2144-6
06:37:38.000 --> 06:37:40.820
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to give you this one.
Now you drop it in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2145-0
06:37:41.340 --> 06:37:44.596
<v Ricky Horton>If your boss calls you,
you leave and walk away.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2145-1
06:37:44.596 --> 06:37:47.653
<v Ricky Horton>You forgot that you did it.
This guy's going,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2145-2
06:37:47.653 --> 06:37:52.371
<v Ricky Horton>my whole schedule just went tense up.
Can you can you say, oh, I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2145-3
06:37:52.371 --> 06:37:57.820
<v Ricky Horton>you want these jobs, that schedule? OK,
you can just say, OK, I don't want those.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2146-0
06:37:58.420 --> 06:38:01.476
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I mean,
I have my own schedule because master</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2146-1
06:38:01.476 --> 06:38:04.943
<v Ricky Horton>schedule never wanted me to mess with the
master schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2146-2
06:38:04.943 --> 06:38:09.703
<v Ricky Horton>So this is tied to the project schedule.
The project schedule is each individual</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2146-3
06:38:09.703 --> 06:38:13.464
<v Ricky Horton>project, right? Yep.
And then the first one we were looking at,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2146-4
06:38:13.464 --> 06:38:14.580
<v Ricky Horton>what's that called?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2147-0
06:38:15.220 --> 06:38:19.400
<v Ricky Horton>So the the production planner,
production planner, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2147-1
06:38:19.400 --> 06:38:23.947
<v Ricky Horton>So it's basically this,
but you can get much more five nights</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2147-2
06:38:23.947 --> 06:38:29.227
<v Ricky Horton>with it if you want the production
planner. I don't think I'd use that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2147-3
06:38:29.227 --> 06:38:30.180
<v Ricky Horton>I'd use this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2148-0
06:38:32.620 --> 06:38:36.962
<v Ricky Horton>They they had,
they've had this for years and when they</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2148-1
06:38:36.962 --> 06:38:40.140
<v Ricky Horton>want me the production planner, I'm like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2149-0
06:38:41.180 --> 06:38:47.037
<v Ricky Horton>Wow, you got this for finance? Yeah.
I thought this was fun for workshops.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2149-1
06:38:47.037 --> 06:38:52.268
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I would think so too.
Says what workshops do you want? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2149-2
06:38:52.268 --> 06:38:55.860
<v Ricky Horton>that's what I do. Or Microsoft Product.
Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2150-0
06:38:56.420 --> 06:39:01.604
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I like this.
And this thing has the has the ability to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2150-1
06:39:01.604 --> 06:39:08.231
<v Ricky Horton>do a start to start or finish to start.
This this particular program is like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2150-2
06:39:08.231 --> 06:39:11.460
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, I like this. That would be good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2151-0
06:39:13.020 --> 06:39:17.546
<v Ricky Horton>And you could put total available hours
if you wanted and then somehow we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2151-1
06:39:17.546 --> 06:39:22.194
<v Ricky Horton>calculate here's how many hours for all
the jobs for two weeks from now and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2151-2
06:39:22.194 --> 06:39:25.741
<v Ricky Horton>here's how many hours available.
So and then you tell OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2151-3
06:39:25.741 --> 06:39:27.820
<v Ricky Horton>I'm short or I'm over or whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2152-0
06:39:28.300 --> 06:39:31.272
<v Ricky Horton>And if what it will do with that is it
does.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2152-1
06:39:31.272 --> 06:39:35.696
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say you put this job for four weeks
and you have 1000 hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2152-2
06:39:35.696 --> 06:39:40.120
<v Ricky Horton>It'll do 250 in each week.
It's just going to make it even, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2152-3
06:39:40.120 --> 06:39:45.469
<v Ricky Horton>But you do have the building going there
manually saying now $500 over the first</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2152-4
06:39:45.469 --> 06:39:47.780
<v Ricky Horton>week they'll split it out, correct?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2153-0
06:39:48.140 --> 06:39:54.220
<v Ricky Horton>And you and you could bot try this every
week. I just pushed out. Yep, Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2153-1
06:39:54.220 --> 06:39:58.140
<v Ricky Horton>And you know, I like,
I don't know for you guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2153-2
06:39:58.140 --> 06:40:02.860
<v Ricky Horton>You guys are already doing what needs to
be done for this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2154-0
06:40:03.260 --> 06:40:09.372
<v Ricky Horton>You're already in scale,
which I'm wondering if you use this to to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2154-1
06:40:09.372 --> 06:40:15.118
<v Ricky Horton>see if it would be.
But we're not using it, right? Yes and no.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2154-2
06:40:15.118 --> 06:40:20.226
<v Ricky Horton>We right now there's only a couple weeks
worth of jobs,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2154-3
06:40:20.226 --> 06:40:22.780
<v Ricky Horton>so there's no really reason.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2155-0
06:40:23.020 --> 06:40:26.053
<v Ricky Horton>Right. But yeah,
when you've been really busy,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2155-1
06:40:26.053 --> 06:40:29.602
<v Ricky Horton>it's like for two or three months.
But the problem is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2155-2
06:40:29.602 --> 06:40:33.860
<v Ricky Horton>when we're really busy,
it's like 30 tiny packages that are gonna</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2155-3
06:40:33.860 --> 06:40:39.215
<v Ricky Horton>be in and out for oh, three days. Got it.
So it takes me longer to set up and it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2155-4
06:40:39.215 --> 06:40:39.860
<v Ricky Horton>5 minutes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2156-0
06:40:40.180 --> 06:40:44.909
<v Ricky Horton>And do all this and it does.
I see for it to it's process in the shop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2156-1
06:40:44.909 --> 06:40:50.178
<v Ricky Horton>and that makes a plumber would be easier
because it's it just happens to work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2156-2
06:40:50.178 --> 06:40:53.623
<v Ricky Horton>package.
I was told there used to be 50 guys right</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2156-3
06:40:53.623 --> 06:40:56.460
<v Ricky Horton>here. Now there's 20 when you get 50 guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2157-0
06:40:56.940 --> 06:41:02.623
<v Ricky Horton>You have two or three months for the work
back then. Yeah. So at times like that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2157-1
06:41:02.623 --> 06:41:07.681
<v Ricky Horton>it would be very useful for you, right?
Yeah, day and night shift. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2157-2
06:41:07.681 --> 06:41:09.760
<v Ricky Horton>because I remember hearing it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2158-0
06:41:14.980 --> 06:41:19.219
<v Ricky Horton>Back in our prime, but I I guess to me,
yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2158-1
06:41:19.219 --> 06:41:25.117
<v Ricky Horton>what you use depends on what you're
trying to accomplish. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2158-2
06:41:25.117 --> 06:41:29.540
<v Ricky Horton>if it's just I need to be able to look
and see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2159-0
06:41:30.180 --> 06:41:33.997
<v Ricky Horton>Two months from now,
whether I have a hole where I can drop a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2159-1
06:41:33.997 --> 06:41:36.582
<v Ricky Horton>job,
you know this this might probably be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2159-2
06:41:36.582 --> 06:41:41.321
<v Ricky Horton>great if it's like, OK, this week,
what packages am I working on and what do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2159-3
06:41:41.321 --> 06:41:44.460
<v Ricky Horton>I need to work on first or the production
planner?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2160-0
06:41:45.620 --> 06:41:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>So who did the skid job for Iowa here or
Gilbert GTS? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2160-1
06:41:50.460 --> 06:41:56.268
<v Ricky Horton>I'm really glad to know this is to be
personal, but I'm learning. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2160-2
06:41:56.268 --> 06:42:00.381
<v Ricky Horton>it looks like Microsoft project only in
some ways.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2160-3
06:42:00.381 --> 06:42:05.140
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's a little better because it's
breaking it out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2161-0
06:42:05.340 --> 06:42:11.277
<v Ricky Horton>By, you know, well, yeah,
automatically from what you have in your</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2161-1
06:42:11.277 --> 06:42:15.972
<v Ricky Horton>estimate. Yeah, yeah. Or So what? What?
Yeah, it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2161-2
06:42:15.972 --> 06:42:23.060
<v Ricky Horton>So when you get an estimate and you get
the job, what does it take? Do you get?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2162-0
06:42:23.540 --> 06:42:34.059
<v Ricky Horton>When you get a job, so OK,
I want you to know what I'm looking at.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2162-1
06:42:34.059 --> 06:42:42.380
<v Ricky Horton>Is that the harvest of the site?
So all those hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2163-0
06:42:42.740 --> 06:42:47.147
<v Ricky Horton>It was all in their venison of your
project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2163-1
06:42:47.147 --> 06:42:54.882
<v Ricky Horton>There's somewhat this confidence that
there has to be made with the nine hours</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2163-2
06:42:54.882 --> 06:43:01.540
<v Ricky Horton>of overall opportunities.
I think it was maybe not that to be with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2164-0
06:43:01.900 --> 06:43:09.174
<v Ricky Horton>You know, it's in the system,
but there's no schedule for it yet, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2164-1
06:43:09.174 --> 06:43:17.444
<v Ricky Horton>So then you should go into that project.
So everybody's schedule and then it shows</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2164-2
06:43:17.444 --> 06:43:18.540
<v Ricky Horton>up on this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2166-0
06:43:18.780 --> 06:43:23.621
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so then you got to put in like a schedule</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2166-1
06:43:23.621 --> 06:43:30.986
<v Ricky Horton>to build for this programming.
So then I would finally you'd also you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2166-2
06:43:30.986 --> 06:43:35.300
<v Ricky Horton>will be from the college screen business.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2167-0
06:43:35.580 --> 06:43:39.940
<v Ricky Horton>But you got to shoot sequences in there.
Yes, and it just marks all of that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2167-1
06:43:39.940 --> 06:43:42.941
<v Ricky Horton>which isn't.
So even once you have the same time and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2167-2
06:43:42.941 --> 06:43:45.885
<v Ricky Horton>you'll just say, look,
even before you sequence it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2167-3
06:43:45.885 --> 06:43:49.735
<v Ricky Horton>the thing was they got 10 million hours.
We put it in the schedule,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2167-4
06:43:49.735 --> 06:43:50.980
<v Ricky Horton>even being a sequence.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2168-0
06:43:51.260 --> 06:43:55.595
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
if you didn't have a sentence and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2168-1
06:43:55.595 --> 06:44:01.989
<v Ricky Horton>leadership, yeah,
they usually just have to say to say all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2168-2
06:44:01.989 --> 06:44:07.191
<v Ricky Horton>this in one giant seat.
It's still put in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2168-3
06:44:07.191 --> 06:44:09.900
<v Ricky Horton>I really want a sentence.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2169-0
06:44:10.140 --> 06:44:14.112
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think it's the least utilized part of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2169-1
06:44:14.112 --> 06:44:18.083
<v Ricky Horton>the system. It is.
It is a Microsoft project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2169-2
06:44:18.083 --> 06:44:23.436
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of people are the one.
It's like I got a spreadsheet to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2169-3
06:44:23.436 --> 06:44:29.220
<v Ricky Horton>understand it. Yeah, just Brents,
you want to take some 3 seconds?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2170-0
06:44:29.900 --> 06:44:32.810
<v Ricky Horton>OK, the color of these boxes are here,
here and here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2170-1
06:44:32.810 --> 06:44:37.121
<v Ricky Horton>and everybody hates their spreadsheet,
but they don't use it because they would</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2170-2
06:44:37.121 --> 06:44:41.054
<v Ricky Horton>have to spend more than 5 minutes.
It's one easy to use the spreadsheet,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2170-3
06:44:41.054 --> 06:44:44.718
<v Ricky Horton>but this one kind of does it
authentically as long as you enter the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2170-4
06:44:44.718 --> 06:44:45.580
<v Ricky Horton>system directly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2171-0
06:44:46.220 --> 06:44:48.020
<v Ricky Horton>It's already there, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2172-0
06:44:50.140 --> 06:44:55.874
<v Ricky Horton>So hopefully it really does depend to me
on your goal for scheduling. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2172-1
06:44:55.874 --> 06:45:00.627
<v Ricky Horton>it depends on my mute.
I need to look and see what's happening</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2172-2
06:45:00.627 --> 06:45:04.700
<v Ricky Horton>this week and move my packages around and
figure out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2173-0
06:45:05.460 --> 06:45:09.117
<v Ricky Horton>What I need to do this week and next week,
yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2173-1
06:45:09.117 --> 06:45:15.386
<v Ricky Horton>I'm the the planner is the tool for that.
This is the I'm saying that maybe not 30,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2173-2
06:45:15.386 --> 06:45:20.460
<v Ricky Horton>000 foot would be, but I'm saying that 10,
000 foot would be, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2174-0
06:45:20.460 --> 06:45:25.902
<v Ricky Horton>I have a feeling these guys,
pretty small amounts of work can do it in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2174-1
06:45:25.902 --> 06:45:29.964
<v Ricky Horton>their head.
If you've got a bunch of 2000 hour jobs,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2174-2
06:45:29.964 --> 06:45:31.420
<v Ricky Horton>you couldn't do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2175-0
06:45:32.980 --> 06:45:36.128
<v Ricky Horton>But well,
it sounds like a bad or it's only a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2175-1
06:45:36.128 --> 06:45:40.713
<v Ricky Horton>couple weeks right now.
So probably pretty easy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2175-2
06:45:40.713 --> 06:45:44.066
<v Ricky Horton>After January 12,
I'll be able to work it again,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2175-3
06:45:44.066 --> 06:45:48.583
<v Ricky Horton>trying to find more work in between here
and there. So, but yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2175-4
06:45:48.583 --> 06:45:52.620
<v Ricky Horton>I guess we're having this work, you know,
all the regular.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2176-0
06:45:52.700 --> 06:45:56.992
<v Ricky Horton>Taters will be giving us overflow.
Your regular guys been coming to you all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2176-1
06:45:56.992 --> 06:45:57.500
<v Ricky Horton>the time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2177-0
06:45:58.380 --> 06:46:01.499
<v Ricky Horton>That's good. Yeah.
We have a good report with all the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2177-1
06:46:01.499 --> 06:46:05.657
<v Ricky Horton>foundators and that, in my opinion,
that should be filling work that we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2177-2
06:46:05.657 --> 06:46:10.392
<v Ricky Horton>should have our own big dogs and that all
all that work that you guys are getting</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2177-3
06:46:10.392 --> 06:46:14.839
<v Ricky Horton>should just be filling things to me.
You all stand to work with whatever the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2177-4
06:46:14.839 --> 06:46:15.820
<v Ricky Horton>hours data space.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2178-0
06:46:15.900 --> 06:46:22.357
<v Ricky Horton>That will keep my head above water,
but I don't think it's delegated</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2178-1
06:46:22.357 --> 06:46:28.159
<v Ricky Horton>salespeople or in charge.
I think it's exactly what I've been</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2178-2
06:46:28.159 --> 06:46:31.060
<v Ricky Horton>saying. It's the key, you know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2179-0
06:46:31.260 --> 06:46:37.866
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this would sound like, you know,
pretty much an opportunity falls in our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2179-1
06:46:37.866 --> 06:46:43.217
<v Ricky Horton>lap hard enough giving the monthly
talking tomorrow or getting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2179-2
06:46:43.217 --> 06:46:46.060
<v Ricky Horton>I did mostly getting work for the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2180-0
06:46:46.100 --> 06:46:49.701
<v Ricky Horton>The city getting work for the company
that stayed down.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2180-1
06:46:49.701 --> 06:46:55.038
<v Ricky Horton>We're not getting much of that work here.
They're just not getting much worry out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2180-2
06:46:55.038 --> 06:46:58.510
<v Ricky Horton>Great Falls is empty.
There's nothing in Great Falls.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2180-3
06:46:58.510 --> 06:47:03.397
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think the caster has much.
I think the answer is the facilities are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2180-4
06:47:03.397 --> 06:47:04.940
<v Ricky Horton>severely under realized.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2181-0
06:47:05.300 --> 06:47:07.220
<v Ricky Horton>And they would like to change the map.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2182-0
06:47:08.100 --> 06:47:08.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2183-0
06:47:09.700 --> 06:47:13.438
<v Ricky Horton>And then New Mexico, they can't,
they can't keep employees.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2183-1
06:47:13.438 --> 06:47:17.175
<v Ricky Horton>They've got three or four guys there at
that facility. See,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2183-2
06:47:17.175 --> 06:47:22.034
<v Ricky Horton>a bunch of estimators needs that we need
to figure out how to build and work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2183-3
06:47:22.034 --> 06:47:26.020
<v Ricky Horton>That's the money so we can get more jobs
and be working better.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2184-0
06:47:26.100 --> 06:47:31.926
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, in a nutshell, absolutely.
And that's the weird thing, man.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2184-1
06:47:31.926 --> 06:47:37.664
<v Ricky Horton>Just like we were so busy all the time.
Don't know what changed,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2184-2
06:47:37.664 --> 06:47:44.460
<v Ricky Horton>but we also had a start to do with this
facility like you do with your hand.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2185-0
06:47:44.900 --> 06:47:47.940
<v Ricky Horton>Much work to be done here. Yeah, I mean.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2186-0
06:47:49.020 --> 06:47:53.989
<v Ricky Horton>And I guess I don't, I don't know.
It's great that maybe a a dollar that I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2186-1
06:47:53.989 --> 06:47:57.500
<v Ricky Horton>can see. Yeah, I don't know.
I think that makes the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2187-0
06:47:59.740 --> 06:48:04.110
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
I guess any company there goes 15 million</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2187-1
06:48:04.110 --> 06:48:05.820
<v Ricky Horton>departmental only.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2188-0
06:48:06.940 --> 06:48:12.836
<v Ricky Horton>It's 30 some odd percent profit margin.
I mean we have marked the phone cranes</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2188-1
06:48:12.836 --> 06:48:17.463
<v Ricky Horton>that's somewhere around 4,
almost 5 million just in one year,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2188-2
06:48:17.463 --> 06:48:21.940
<v Ricky Horton>just in one year and that's, yeah,
you're probably getting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2189-0
06:48:23.460 --> 06:48:29.367
<v Ricky Horton>Dana, Robert. Sorry, I haven't found it.
I just kind of asked the same question.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2189-1
06:48:29.367 --> 06:48:32.940
<v Ricky Horton>You and I got a lot of the same questions,
yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2190-0
06:48:36.780 --> 06:48:42.713
<v Ricky Horton>But as far as tech was concerned,
I think we can just show us it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2190-1
06:48:42.713 --> 06:48:48.645
<v Ricky Horton>It would be very helpful.
We don't have all this. This is even 1,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2190-2
06:48:48.645 --> 06:48:52.420
<v Ricky Horton>2025, 324,000 pounds shipped to job sites.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2191-0
06:48:53.260 --> 06:48:56.340
<v Ricky Horton>And then Q1 of 2023.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2192-0
06:49:00.260 --> 06:49:04.544
<v Ricky Horton>568,000 lbs.
Should we know how much we're done,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2192-1
06:49:04.544 --> 06:49:08.827
<v Ricky Horton>we're selling,
we're still on average Q 1/20/24,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2192-2
06:49:08.827 --> 06:49:15.471
<v Ricky Horton>I guess we're not entirely certain.
So we're quite a bit of land this year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2192-3
06:49:15.471 --> 06:49:18.180
<v Ricky Horton>Well, this is a quarter of one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2193-0
06:49:18.660 --> 06:49:26.708
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So Q 4/20/24, yeah,
that's what we're going to see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2193-1
06:49:26.708 --> 06:49:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>And where are we at now? Q4 hasn't done,
said none Q3.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2194-0
06:49:34.820 --> 06:49:40.100
<v Ricky Horton>634 That's all about fixing me in North.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2195-0
06:49:42.100 --> 06:49:44.940
<v Ricky Horton>What are you sellable? Uh, 850.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2196-0
06:49:48.740 --> 06:49:55.220
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I'm going to do. Yeah, it's,
I mean the in mind different facets of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2196-1
06:49:55.220 --> 06:49:59.837
<v Ricky Horton>work that we're bidding.
I don't know if there's a true,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2196-2
06:49:59.837 --> 06:50:05.020
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure there's an average,
but I'm not tribute to an average.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2197-0
06:50:05.460 --> 06:50:09.420
<v Ricky Horton>How about any of the jobs that you bid?
Do you know what any of them are?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2198-0
06:50:10.860 --> 06:50:10.900
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2199-0
06:50:11.940 --> 06:50:17.312
<v Ricky Horton>Or do you not look at price per pound
price per pound? No, usually.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2199-1
06:50:17.312 --> 06:50:23.079
<v Ricky Horton>I can certainly figure it out.
But like a TSMC job which you're about to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2199-2
06:50:23.079 --> 06:50:27.660
<v Ricky Horton>do, what's the sell for?
Do you know the call to sell it?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2200-0
06:50:36.220 --> 06:50:40.900
<v Ricky Horton>What do you get scheduled for a month to
check? Anything you all welcome.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2201-0
06:50:42.340 --> 06:50:46.900
<v Ricky Horton>Are supposed to be some kind of old
public presentation.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2201-1
06:50:46.900 --> 06:50:52.660
<v Ricky Horton>I don't even know what that is.
We don't give. We don't do the cadence.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2201-2
06:50:52.660 --> 06:50:56.900
<v Ricky Horton>The what?
We don't want to talk about floor cadence.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2201-3
06:50:56.900 --> 06:50:58.260
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2202-0
06:51:04.260 --> 06:51:11.670
<v Ricky Horton>How many for the airport?
Why is it like 340? So get to the new one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2202-1
06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:14.140
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, no more than two.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2203-0
06:51:15.540 --> 06:51:20.980
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know, I'm just, uh,
over the weekend.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2204-0
06:51:22.420 --> 06:51:26.771
<v Ricky Horton>But it was at,
but we got there for the flight</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2204-1
06:51:26.771 --> 06:51:30.380
<v Ricky Horton>department at 5:13 and we got it there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2205-0
06:51:32.220 --> 06:51:37.500
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, this is a one job right here 4.
6 million.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2206-0
06:51:49.380 --> 06:51:50.580
<v Ricky Horton>Back in the What is this?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2207-0
06:51:51.660 --> 06:51:56.744
<v Ricky Horton>What was your question?
What software are you looking at?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2207-1
06:51:56.744 --> 06:51:59.460
<v Ricky Horton>This is Poco, I see, and I was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2208-0
06:52:04.820 --> 06:52:05.020
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2212-0
06:52:24.700 --> 06:52:25.180
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2216-0
06:52:52.700 --> 06:53:01.287
<v Ricky Horton>I believe when we have to,
we have to go in, we have to go in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2216-1
06:53:01.287 --> 06:53:03.740
<v Ricky Horton>That is not a job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2217-0
06:53:09.740 --> 06:53:12.940
<v Ricky Horton>This part of the European system can't
just put that out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2218-0
06:53:21.500 --> 06:53:32.500
<v Ricky Horton>I assume that doesn't deal with dollars
involved, but you have the contract price.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2220-0
06:53:35.420 --> 06:53:40.061
<v Ricky Horton>It'll figure out dollar for found dollar
for. There's metrics for that in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2220-1
06:53:40.061 --> 06:53:42.180
<v Ricky Horton>You can pull up if you want to do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2221-0
06:53:43.260 --> 06:53:46.740
<v Ricky Horton>If you have to put it from,
you have to put the commercial side into.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2222-0
06:53:47.900 --> 06:53:50.820
<v Ricky Horton>I was just wondering to see what if it's
all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2223-0
06:53:51.980 --> 06:53:56.020
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see dollars anywhere.
I see an app. All right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2226-0
06:54:04.300 --> 06:54:07.222
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I mean you you can see the this is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2226-1
06:54:07.222 --> 06:54:11.641
<v Ricky Horton>showing you use an estimate summary.
Use an estimate summary.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2226-2
06:54:11.641 --> 06:54:14.420
<v Ricky Horton>It'll give you all that, all that data.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2229-0
06:54:34.780 --> 06:54:37.740
<v Ricky Horton>Just interested on side downstairs to
know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2230-0
06:54:41.060 --> 06:54:46.560
<v Ricky Horton>For me, dollars per pound for 836, eight,
516-1704316.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2230-1
06:54:46.560 --> 06:54:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>I always want to know the metrics Andy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2231-0
06:54:55.340 --> 06:54:59.860
<v Ricky Horton>Are you pulling out a table to put in
here to wrap your split up?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2232-0
06:55:01.340 --> 06:55:07.696
<v Ricky Horton>Long way to do it,
so we need to do this with summary,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2232-1
06:55:07.696 --> 06:55:08.620
<v Ricky Horton>I guess.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2233-0
06:55:12.300 --> 06:55:18.279
<v Ricky Horton>We have done it in the summary before.
I think the other reason we haven't done</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2233-1
06:55:18.279 --> 06:55:24.482
<v Ricky Horton>it until we see any of this for summaries
is if we haven't updated any of our tech</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2233-2
06:55:24.482 --> 06:55:29.340
<v Ricky Horton>level reports to have a loan Roman.
This all reflects one Roman.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2234-0
06:55:29.660 --> 06:55:37.787
<v Ricky Horton>And also I have the ability to play with
the margins and there's something that's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2234-1
06:55:37.787 --> 06:55:44.625
<v Ricky Horton>a little bit easier in this.
What I what I just keep seeing is there</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2234-2
06:55:44.625 --> 06:55:49.580
<v Ricky Horton>are 18 programs that we got to get in to
do this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2235-0
06:55:49.660 --> 06:55:53.971
<v Ricky Horton>Same thing that we can do in the blood
for if they like me.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2235-1
06:55:53.971 --> 06:55:56.700
<v Ricky Horton>I just came to figure out why that is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2236-0
06:55:58.460 --> 06:56:00.342
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it seems like something that is the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2236-1
06:56:00.342 --> 06:56:00.700
<v Ricky Horton>biggest.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2237-0
06:56:02.140 --> 06:56:09.573
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think there's legacy, mom,
and I think that's all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2237-1
06:56:09.573 --> 06:56:18.139
<v Ricky Horton>And I think legacy was X and well,
it's just like there's pieces of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2237-2
06:56:18.139 --> 06:56:21.540
<v Ricky Horton>information everywhere, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2238-0
06:56:22.060 --> 06:56:26.319
<v Ricky Horton>I'll do the test and get this part of the
text,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2238-1
06:56:26.319 --> 06:56:31.466
<v Ricky Horton>but I'll do the purple and get in this
part of this. Yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2238-2
06:56:31.466 --> 06:56:35.991
<v Ricky Horton>I know it's in one place and in the
moment. Vista.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2238-3
06:56:35.991 --> 06:56:39.540
<v Ricky Horton>I predict everything has to go to Vista.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2239-0
06:56:39.980 --> 06:56:41.660
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know about this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2240-0
06:56:42.780 --> 06:56:46.328
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
Think that's where the proposal's coming</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2240-1
06:56:46.328 --> 06:56:51.460
<v Ricky Horton>out. I don't know. I look,
I read back the proposals and I couldn't</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2240-2
06:56:51.460 --> 06:56:55.460
<v Ricky Horton>decide what generated.
I think everything generated.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2241-0
06:56:56.620 --> 06:57:00.118
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I think.
I think they're going to come out of him,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2241-1
06:57:00.118 --> 06:57:00.340
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2242-0
06:57:01.620 --> 06:57:06.322
<v Ricky Horton>I have seen all of those. Yeah,
I think they're putting bring everything,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2242-1
06:57:06.322 --> 06:57:10.324
<v Ricky Horton>all the dollars and everything company
they have to bid. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2242-2
06:57:10.324 --> 06:57:15.533
<v Ricky Horton>because there's a there's a 67 page thing
that went to that. Yeah, we got a copy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2242-3
06:57:15.533 --> 06:57:19.980
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, with the CSSC one, no no pricing.
Just one I didn't price like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2243-0
06:57:20.700 --> 06:57:24.624
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't go through labor codes,
calculate everything out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2243-1
06:57:24.624 --> 06:57:29.878
<v Ricky Horton>Not when we submitted a ton of time.
You know we had to drastically reduce our</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2243-2
06:57:29.878 --> 06:57:33.535
<v Ricky Horton>our labor rates,
our labor rate was lower so that with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2243-3
06:57:33.535 --> 06:57:36.860
<v Ricky Horton>Margo it was a certain dollar rate to be
able to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2244-0
06:57:37.060 --> 06:57:43.420
<v Ricky Horton>But we worked. So I mean,
you can do all that already, so forget.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2245-0
06:57:48.780 --> 06:57:53.081
<v Ricky Horton>So if I didn't want to use the labor here,
I just want to do a price per pound.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2245-1
06:57:53.081 --> 06:57:57.113
<v Ricky Horton>I changed the unit cost up there because
you got your your weight in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2245-2
06:57:57.113 --> 06:58:00.500
<v Ricky Horton>I changed my unit cost and I go down to
labor and I zero that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2246-0
06:58:02.340 --> 06:58:02.580
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2247-0
06:58:03.660 --> 06:58:04.660
<v Ricky Horton>We'll do that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2248-0
06:58:11.620 --> 06:58:12.580
<v Ricky Horton>It comes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2251-0
06:58:26.620 --> 06:58:30.579
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I'm just.
So the quantum there is in balance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2251-1
06:58:30.579 --> 06:58:35.964
<v Ricky Horton>What are you trying to do?
So if we were trying to switch this to a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2251-2
06:58:35.964 --> 06:58:40.318
<v Ricky Horton>price price per pound, yes,
just unit cost versus .64,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2251-3
06:58:40.318 --> 06:58:42.060
<v Ricky Horton>just talk to whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2252-0
06:58:42.460 --> 06:58:45.293
<v Ricky Horton>But $2.
00 will make sense if you want to or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2252-1
06:58:45.293 --> 06:58:48.189
<v Ricky Horton>something like that.
What's that going to be?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2252-2
06:58:48.189 --> 06:58:53.414
<v Ricky Horton>And then that would give us this is our
way. Yeah, 250. The others are kind. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2252-3
06:58:53.414 --> 06:58:57.443
<v Ricky Horton>we can go down to the hours down here.
Where's your sale price?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2252-4
06:58:57.443 --> 06:59:01.220
<v Ricky Horton>Where's your sale price on here?
All the way at the bottom.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2253-0
06:59:02.540 --> 06:59:06.260
<v Ricky Horton>Is that the real sell price?
Go over to the right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2254-0
06:59:12.060 --> 06:59:14.580
<v Ricky Horton>There's yourself price for how many
pounds?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2255-0
06:59:15.620 --> 06:59:21.714
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that this is, this isn't a problem.
We we, we respond. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2255-1
06:59:21.714 --> 06:59:28.932
<v Ricky Horton>I'm with you because when you clicked the
250, you changed everything. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2255-2
06:59:28.932 --> 06:59:30.900
<v Ricky Horton>that 250 is probably.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2256-0
06:59:31.180 --> 06:59:34.970
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we want to know.
We want the program to calculate based on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2256-1
06:59:34.970 --> 06:59:38.293
<v Ricky Horton>the sale. No, no,
that's to me right there should be the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2256-2
06:59:38.293 --> 06:59:41.791
<v Ricky Horton>price of my material,
just the material line that it should</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2256-3
06:59:41.791 --> 06:59:44.706
<v Ricky Horton>have made the value of my purchase orders,
right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2256-4
06:59:44.706 --> 06:59:49.020
<v Ricky Horton>And that's that's what that normally is,
but in this scenario he can say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2257-0
06:59:49.220 --> 06:59:55.172
<v Ricky Horton>We didn't do the labour.
We just saw that a price per pound for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2257-1
06:59:55.172 --> 06:59:59.636
<v Ricky Horton>the. I'm sorry,
they never ran into the labour.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2257-2
06:59:59.636 --> 07:00:04.100
<v Ricky Horton>So do you have any idea what this job
sold for?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2259-0
07:00:13.020 --> 07:00:14.260
<v Ricky Horton>Windows M.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2261-0
07:00:31.340 --> 07:00:34.159
<v Ricky Horton>But you have to go in the folder to look
at it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2261-1
07:00:34.159 --> 07:00:38.740
<v Ricky Horton>You wouldn't just hop into Vista to look
at it. I think there's some of that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2262-0
07:00:40.060 --> 07:00:45.783
<v Ricky Horton>But you won the job, right?
But because you submitted that bid,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2262-1
07:00:45.783 --> 07:00:49.180
<v Ricky Horton>you entered it in Vista as a contract.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2263-0
07:00:52.740 --> 07:00:53.380
<v Ricky Horton>It's for railways.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2264-0
07:00:54.620 --> 07:00:57.135
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the proposal is just to keep the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2264-1
07:00:57.135 --> 07:00:57.780
<v Ricky Horton>proposals.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2265-0
07:01:04.580 --> 07:01:12.628
<v Ricky Horton>So 2021 hours, maybe $27,000, 15,
000 profit at a 12% level.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2265-1
07:01:12.628 --> 07:01:19.620
<v Ricky Horton>The other one was at 338,000 lbs.
That is not right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2266-0
07:01:21.100 --> 07:01:21.580
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2267-0
07:01:26.580 --> 07:01:28.940
<v Ricky Horton>159 lbs.</v>

07:01:48.580 --> 07:01:49.500
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty see that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2271-0
07:01:51.580 --> 07:01:55.540
<v Ricky Horton>Or 56,000 pounds. That still makes sense.
No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2272-0
07:01:56.620 --> 07:02:01.828
<v Ricky Horton>By the way,
if you're trying to get 6000 lbs, $0.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2272-1
07:02:01.828 --> 07:02:07.139
<v Ricky Horton>50 per.
If you if you got to do it as labour only,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2272-2
07:02:07.139 --> 07:02:08.180
<v Ricky Horton>it's like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2273-0
07:02:09.260 --> 07:02:11.460
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there's no material in that. Oh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2274-0
07:02:12.700 --> 07:02:20.480
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, OK. Yeah, that's labor only. Still,
that's ridiculous. That's chef's only,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2274-1
07:02:20.480 --> 07:02:26.915
<v Ricky Horton>$127,000 for 256,000 lbs.
You're doing the labor at $0.50 a pound.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2274-2
07:02:26.915 --> 07:02:29.700
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I'm just doing labor.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2275-0
07:02:29.980 --> 07:02:30.740
<v Ricky Horton>$2.00 a down.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2276-0
07:02:34.540 --> 07:02:40.100
<v Ricky Horton>128 cents. We make money.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2277-0
07:02:41.380 --> 07:02:44.340
<v Ricky Horton>Make someone about 15, right?
So you were getting paid.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2278-0
07:02:47.180 --> 07:02:50.973
<v Ricky Horton>$60.
00 an hour if you did the job really in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2278-1
07:02:50.973 --> 07:02:51.900
<v Ricky Horton>2100 hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2279-0
07:02:51.980 --> 07:02:52.140
<v Ricky Horton>Hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2280-0
07:02:53.700 --> 07:02:55.620
<v Ricky Horton>You know, search area conferences.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2281-0
07:02:56.820 --> 07:02:57.700
<v Ricky Horton>Said 15,000.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2282-0
07:02:59.460 --> 07:03:04.460
<v Ricky Horton>What do you say? OK, yeah, yeah,
it's not very much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2284-0
07:03:05.780 --> 07:03:12.220
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I mean, what's the shop right here?
Cost. We're gonna fix it. Uh, cost.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2285-0
07:03:13.620 --> 07:03:17.963
<v Ricky Horton>That's hard 'cause they keep,
they keep splitting up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2285-1
07:03:17.963 --> 07:03:22.064
<v Ricky Horton>They're trying to split overhead out of
it. So um,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2285-2
07:03:22.064 --> 07:03:27.613
<v Ricky Horton>I think our actual sell is like 40 maybe
$49 or something like that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2285-3
07:03:27.613 --> 07:03:28.980
<v Ricky Horton>without overhead.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2286-0
07:03:30.540 --> 07:03:33.940
<v Ricky Horton>Suing shop management leads and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2287-0
07:03:35.460 --> 07:03:39.780
<v Ricky Horton>And employees. So this is only a really.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2288-0
07:03:42.700 --> 07:03:51.420
<v Ricky Horton>So not fun, but we need to work,
so we got it. Sure, I can understand.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2289-0
07:03:52.820 --> 07:03:59.354
<v Ricky Horton>Take my local office market.
It's OK and we really need. So this one,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2289-1
07:03:59.354 --> 07:04:00.940
<v Ricky Horton>this one was our.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2290-0
07:04:05.860 --> 07:04:08.220
<v Ricky Horton>So it's like a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2291-0
07:04:13.020 --> 07:04:15.540
<v Ricky Horton>One second, we got there first.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2292-0
07:04:18.100 --> 07:04:20.940
<v Ricky Horton>So the contract price is 1563.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2293-0
07:04:23.140 --> 07:04:27.071
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
which is actually more because there's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2293-1
07:04:27.071 --> 07:04:34.058
<v Ricky Horton>cheap original. This is the original 1,
000,600 is a lot close. I think it's 1,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2293-2
07:04:34.058 --> 07:04:36.940
<v Ricky Horton>612,000. Where are the thousands?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2294-0
07:04:38.220 --> 07:04:38.580
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2295-0
07:04:49.540 --> 07:04:53.940
<v Ricky Horton>685,582 66558265655582655582.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2296-0
07:05:05.020 --> 07:05:08.540
<v Ricky Horton>Which we had to say it again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2297-0
07:05:12.020 --> 07:05:21.700
<v Ricky Horton>So Chief, this is our, this is our video.
So that one we're doing well, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2298-0
07:05:22.900 --> 07:05:23.980
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2299-0
07:05:26.180 --> 07:05:31.540
<v Ricky Horton>That one we were probably going to finish
at a 47%.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2300-0
07:05:32.900 --> 07:05:35.713
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so we aren't cheap fabricators if we're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2300-1
07:05:35.713 --> 07:05:40.060
<v Ricky Horton>making make that kind of money,
but we're fabricating really cheap.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2301-0
07:05:41.100 --> 07:05:46.173
<v Ricky Horton>So, OK,
you're you're we're talking about sooner.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2301-1
07:05:46.173 --> 07:05:50.940
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see what that is. Yeah, that's true.
So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2302-0
07:05:52.500 --> 07:05:55.843
<v Ricky Horton>We we have. I mean,
we're pretty much trying to run through</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2302-1
07:05:55.843 --> 07:05:58.573
<v Ricky Horton>everything we're going to do on on the
business.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2302-2
07:05:58.573 --> 07:06:02.918
<v Ricky Horton>I'll tell you what I would like to do.
Yeah. What's that? I mean, OK, so I'm,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2302-3
07:06:02.918 --> 07:06:07.375
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty much brought here to say what
are we doing in tech, all right? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2302-4
07:06:07.375 --> 07:06:07.820
<v Ricky Horton>exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2303-0
07:06:08.100 --> 07:06:12.016
<v Ricky Horton>I would,
I would like to absolutely run through</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2303-1
07:06:12.016 --> 07:06:17.401
<v Ricky Horton>the entire workflow and say what's in
tech or what's not in tech,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2303-2
07:06:17.401 --> 07:06:22.540
<v Ricky Horton>but where are we doing and I'm estimating
all of our shipping.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2304-0
07:06:23.420 --> 07:06:26.567
<v Ricky Horton>How? How's it being done?
Where should be done?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2304-1
07:06:26.567 --> 07:06:28.140
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure everything is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2305-0
07:06:30.340 --> 07:06:36.339
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds great to me.
Kind of like with with estimating that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2305-1
07:06:36.339 --> 07:06:40.100
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I'm not, yeah, if if the goal is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2306-0
07:06:40.380 --> 07:06:40.620
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2307-0
07:06:41.820 --> 07:06:45.127
<v Ricky Horton>Well, yeah,
what I'm leaving in writing report,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2307-1
07:06:45.127 --> 07:06:50.295
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get my opinion that. I mean,
obviously part of what part of what I'll</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2307-2
07:06:50.295 --> 07:06:55.669
<v Ricky Horton>say is I think there's way too many
programs that are being used for the same</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2307-3
07:06:55.669 --> 07:06:57.460
<v Ricky Horton>thing. It's like, Oh yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2308-0
07:06:57.820 --> 07:07:03.498
<v Ricky Horton>That, you know,
to me estimating is there that that's my</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2308-1
07:07:03.498 --> 07:07:10.073
<v Ricky Horton>flow chart. So you made it. Yeah,
I was like, how record is this?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2308-2
07:07:10.073 --> 07:07:13.260
<v Ricky Horton>It's the it's typical flow of a.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2310-0
07:07:13.340 --> 07:07:19.522
<v Ricky Horton>Of a structured job and so it it and what
part of the system here can be used and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2310-1
07:07:19.522 --> 07:07:23.065
<v Ricky Horton>then it can be modified for your own
purposes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2310-2
07:07:23.065 --> 07:07:29.020
<v Ricky Horton>So what you're saying if you'd like to
say this is what you think it could be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-0
07:07:29.100 --> 07:07:32.770
<v Ricky Horton>You'd like to know what it is.
That's kind of the the door. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-1
07:07:32.770 --> 07:07:37.330
<v Ricky Horton>I want to know what's what's what the I
think it's great idea because I'd love to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-2
07:07:37.330 --> 07:07:40.722
<v Ricky Horton>know it myself. Yeah,
I'd like to kind of just start walking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-3
07:07:40.722 --> 07:07:43.614
<v Ricky Horton>through it,
really walking through an estimate like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-4
07:07:43.614 --> 07:07:47.395
<v Ricky Horton>you know what's be what part of the
estimate is being done in here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2311-5
07:07:47.395 --> 07:07:48.340
<v Ricky Horton>how the material.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2312-0
07:07:48.780 --> 07:07:54.421
<v Ricky Horton>We're sitting there. Yeah, I got, I got,
you know, most of this stuff,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2312-1
07:07:54.421 --> 07:08:01.015
<v Ricky Horton>but I think it'd be great to have. Yeah,
the hard part's not having our estimators</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2312-2
07:08:01.015 --> 07:08:05.940
<v Ricky Horton>here because I can only speak truth to.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2313-0
07:08:06.220 --> 07:08:11.455
<v Ricky Horton>Because everything that I do when I run
through to check with all my,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2313-1
07:08:11.455 --> 07:08:16.540
<v Ricky Horton>so I do all say all to be.
This is also my going back to everything</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2313-2
07:08:16.540 --> 07:08:19.831
<v Ricky Horton>you do.
But even when you're wrapping it up</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2313-3
07:08:19.831 --> 07:08:23.420
<v Ricky Horton>though,
you're going over in the program or so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2314-0
07:08:23.900 --> 07:08:29.788
<v Ricky Horton>Is that a company reason for that or is
that a that's just what we do thing or is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2314-1
07:08:29.788 --> 07:08:35.531
<v Ricky Horton>it you know is there and it may be the
best thing I'm just saying it seems like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2314-2
07:08:35.531 --> 07:08:40.700
<v Ricky Horton>actually work to me because now I've got
to create each other they are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2315-0
07:08:40.940 --> 07:08:47.317
<v Ricky Horton>Pull all this information from tech or to
take over or to do something,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2315-1
07:08:47.317 --> 07:08:53.429
<v Ricky Horton>whereas I do that at the time in here.
Yeah, there's a reason it is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2315-2
07:08:53.429 --> 07:08:57.060
<v Ricky Horton>but and pro core whenever we get the job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2316-0
07:08:57.420 --> 07:09:00.554
<v Ricky Horton>We we have an opportunity,
we create an opportunity,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2316-1
07:09:00.554 --> 07:09:05.343
<v Ricky Horton>fill out a new opportunity form and then
they create an estimate folder and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2316-2
07:09:05.343 --> 07:09:09.837
<v Ricky Horton>they create the job and pro order and
then they assign it to the associated</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2316-3
07:09:09.837 --> 07:09:13.207
<v Ricky Horton>estimator, which is then tilted,
tiny sales force, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2316-4
07:09:13.207 --> 07:09:14.980
<v Ricky Horton>which is the sale opportunity.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2317-0
07:09:15.340 --> 07:09:19.477
<v Ricky Horton>And then depending upon the status
updates in for a board,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2317-1
07:09:19.477 --> 07:09:24.524
<v Ricky Horton>whether it's submitted or worded and
whatnot, based upon the bid board,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2317-2
07:09:24.524 --> 07:09:28.801
<v Ricky Horton>this kind of stuff, updates, Salesforce,
so on and so forth.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2317-3
07:09:28.801 --> 07:09:34.550
<v Ricky Horton>But you want to go through the whole job
start and finish that we're using within</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2317-4
07:09:34.550 --> 07:09:34.900
<v Ricky Horton>tech.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2318-0
07:09:35.100 --> 07:09:39.089
<v Ricky Horton>Is that correct? Yeah.
Estimating all the regulations. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2318-1
07:09:39.089 --> 07:09:42.031
<v Ricky Horton>It's just got to make sure here's the
stats,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2318-2
07:09:42.031 --> 07:09:46.607
<v Ricky Horton>which you can do that you as the banker
option. Yeah. Yeah. So where,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2318-3
07:09:46.607 --> 07:09:47.980
<v Ricky Horton>where do we estimate?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2319-0
07:09:49.260 --> 07:09:56.700
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, we estimate and check the heavy dead.
I think there's one other one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2320-0
07:10:01.340 --> 07:10:06.900
<v Ricky Horton>But all structural is estimated in time.
I understand any guess I agree.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2321-0
07:10:08.380 --> 07:10:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>Now, based on what I've heard, yeah,
in my six days, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2322-0
07:10:18.020 --> 07:10:20.820
<v Ricky Horton>And yet,
do we want to walk through this now?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2322-1
07:10:20.820 --> 07:10:24.837
<v Ricky Horton>We can start through this now.
We want to wait till more. No, no,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2322-2
07:10:24.837 --> 07:10:29.340
<v Ricky Horton>do it now. All right. So, all right.
Estimating. We get a job, all right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2323-0
07:10:30.060 --> 07:10:34.338
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, I'm happy to.
I can't able to answer my tip from from</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2323-1
07:10:34.338 --> 07:10:37.140
<v Ricky Horton>for you browser, so like this will be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2324-0
07:10:38.300 --> 07:10:42.940
<v Ricky Horton>But now, first of all,
some of us in Texas, some in heavy bid.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2325-0
07:10:44.620 --> 07:10:49.077
<v Ricky Horton>Somewhere else,
somewhere additional system that I'm not</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2325-1
07:10:49.077 --> 07:10:49.780
<v Ricky Horton>privy to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2326-0
07:10:52.020 --> 07:10:57.260
<v Ricky Horton>But for for what you do for the
structural side, it's heated.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2327-0
07:10:59.940 --> 07:11:04.575
<v Ricky Horton>Did Mark in here as well or she does does
another thing. Mark,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2327-1
07:11:04.575 --> 07:11:09.578
<v Ricky Horton>she can do manual takeouts.
I'm doing type of takeouts so we can on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2327-2
07:11:09.578 --> 07:11:12.300
<v Ricky Horton>the same jobs. Yeah, same, same jobs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2328-0
07:11:14.300 --> 07:11:14.420
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2329-0
07:11:20.660 --> 07:11:23.551
<v Ricky Horton>You want to go through the steps of the
estimate,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2329-1
07:11:23.551 --> 07:11:28.176
<v Ricky Horton>how he puts the estimate together. Well,
I mean, we don't have to do the steps,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2329-2
07:11:28.176 --> 07:11:28.580
<v Ricky Horton>but um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2330-0
07:11:30.780 --> 07:11:35.907
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say a little bit elevated without
getting into the details.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2330-1
07:11:35.907 --> 07:11:39.403
<v Ricky Horton>Do you get the job?
Do you run us from tech?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2330-2
07:11:39.403 --> 07:11:45.151
<v Ricky Horton>Do you pop it into the project?
You're estimate or not? No, I'll link it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2330-3
07:11:45.151 --> 07:11:46.860
<v Ricky Horton>So you. OK, I'll link.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2331-0
07:11:47.540 --> 07:11:50.820
<v Ricky Horton>Of like so like this one MGS um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2332-0
07:11:52.140 --> 07:11:57.332
<v Ricky Horton>This is my. This is my estimate in here.
So I'll enter the production control</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2332-1
07:11:57.332 --> 07:12:02.723
<v Ricky Horton>'cause I prefer entering almost something
there. I'll enter everything in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2332-2
07:12:02.723 --> 07:12:06.583
<v Ricky Horton>I'll export kiss file,
import it in here so it has all my</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2332-3
07:12:06.583 --> 07:12:07.980
<v Ricky Horton>information and then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2333-0
07:12:08.100 --> 07:12:13.767
<v Ricky Horton>All my bridge outs.
So and then it's the job that you've got</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2333-1
07:12:13.767 --> 07:12:19.249
<v Ricky Horton>to do it. Yeah,
it's having a the one piece this week. OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2333-2
07:12:19.249 --> 07:12:22.500
<v Ricky Horton>And so I'll estimate by by drawing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2334-0
07:12:23.540 --> 07:12:34.337
<v Ricky Horton>And break all this information down and
then give my total hours and and then I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2334-1
07:12:34.337 --> 07:12:39.060
<v Ricky Horton>end up going into pro board and 06.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2336-0
07:12:49.060 --> 07:12:50.420
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2339-0
07:13:02.660 --> 07:13:08.251
<v Ricky Horton>It's the side of these estimators.
So I'll go in and estimating part of part</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2339-1
07:13:08.251 --> 07:13:14.204
<v Ricky Horton>of why I think we were also doing it in
here is to the codings side of things are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2339-2
07:13:14.204 --> 07:13:17.980
<v Ricky Horton>all broke out in here.
They have codings broke out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2339-3
07:13:17.980 --> 07:13:21.900
<v Ricky Horton>I'll make the attack limit now I'll just
add to that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2340-0
07:13:22.260 --> 07:13:25.348
<v Ricky Horton>And do all of those,
do all the steps in there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2340-1
07:13:25.348 --> 07:13:30.174
<v Ricky Horton>But I'll go in here and I'll plug in my
shop hours for what was estimated.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2340-2
07:13:30.174 --> 07:13:34.291
<v Ricky Horton>I'll go in and take all the quotes that I
got for my materials.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2340-3
07:13:34.291 --> 07:13:39.180
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have all my material quotes in here.
So let's go back here real quick.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2341-0
07:13:39.540 --> 07:13:42.180
<v Ricky Horton>So the material cost is not intact.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2342-0
07:13:43.820 --> 07:13:49.900
<v Ricky Horton>OK, we're not using it. Are we purchasing?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2343-0
07:13:51.300 --> 07:13:55.999
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't.
I I haven't messed around plugging any of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2343-1
07:13:55.999 --> 07:14:00.611
<v Ricky Horton>my quotes into Tegrify.
Usually just you know, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2343-2
07:14:00.611 --> 07:14:06.180
<v Ricky Horton>because this is essentially where where I
build my my proposal.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2344-0
07:14:06.820 --> 07:14:13.218
<v Ricky Horton>Break everything down, verifications,
putting information, inclusions,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2344-1
07:14:13.218 --> 07:14:18.895
<v Ricky Horton>exclusions for for everything.
And then this is all for, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2344-2
07:14:18.895 --> 07:14:22.860
<v Ricky Horton>this is all for,
so I'll submit everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2345-0
07:14:22.940 --> 07:14:26.452
<v Ricky Horton>Through here. Yeah. I mean,
we want something like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2345-1
07:14:26.452 --> 07:14:31.503
<v Ricky Horton>So you do this because you don't have all
this set up in a low growth template in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2345-2
07:14:31.503 --> 07:14:32.180
<v Ricky Horton>tech, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2346-0
07:14:33.660 --> 07:14:37.948
<v Ricky Horton>So if you have this all in Tekla,
you would stop using Procor. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2346-1
07:14:37.948 --> 07:14:41.055
<v Ricky Horton>that's the reason why I need to use
Procor. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2346-2
07:14:41.055 --> 07:14:45.901
<v Ricky Horton>because they would save a whole lot of
transfer of data over this. Basically,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2346-3
07:14:45.901 --> 07:14:50.810
<v Ricky Horton>can you go back on the job and show us
where you put the material cost and you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2346-4
07:14:50.810 --> 07:14:52.860
<v Ricky Horton>had Procor entered it into Tekla?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2349-0
07:15:03.540 --> 07:15:08.224
<v Ricky Horton>That is what you want, right Ricky? Yeah,
well, I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2349-1
07:15:08.224 --> 07:15:14.999
<v Ricky Horton>it does sound like you can go to the bits
up for any reason in tech, right? Yep,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2349-2
07:15:14.999 --> 07:15:18.260
<v Ricky Horton>because this is where you wrap this up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2350-0
07:15:19.620 --> 07:15:23.421
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, if you're doing,
we're purchasing from here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2350-1
07:15:23.421 --> 07:15:29.123
<v Ricky Horton>your number has to be in here somewhere
you can buy material for, right? No, no,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2350-2
07:15:29.123 --> 07:15:32.712
<v Ricky Horton>it's not whatsoever. It's not tied in. OK.
I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2350-3
07:15:32.712 --> 07:15:36.020
<v Ricky Horton>you could do this here for material, yes,
but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2351-0
07:15:36.540 --> 07:15:43.683
<v Ricky Horton>That is not where I would normally do it.
I will be putting it on each like if I</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2351-1
07:15:43.683 --> 07:15:49.679
<v Ricky Horton>had a bank and a half two,
I'm going to put you know specific price</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2351-2
07:15:49.679 --> 07:15:52.500
<v Ricky Horton>on it, but I have as opposed to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2352-0
07:15:54.140 --> 07:15:57.778
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, any other size.
So like when you write out your purchase</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2352-1
07:15:57.778 --> 07:16:00.435
<v Ricky Horton>order,
you're going to the project management</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2352-2
07:16:00.435 --> 07:16:03.784
<v Ricky Horton>section, right?
Or your purchasing section. I don't know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2352-3
07:16:03.784 --> 07:16:08.288
<v Ricky Horton>production control, production control.
You're not using the estimate at all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2352-4
07:16:08.288 --> 07:16:10.020
<v Ricky Horton>So open up production control.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2353-0
07:16:10.460 --> 07:16:14.683
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see what's your work,
but that but that's not what we would do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2353-1
07:16:14.683 --> 07:16:17.620
<v Ricky Horton>here for the estimate close out of here,
right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2354-0
07:16:20.180 --> 07:16:24.318
<v Ricky Horton>So if I'm pricing material here,
first of all, the material,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2354-1
07:16:24.318 --> 07:16:29.269
<v Ricky Horton>the the material cost can just flow in
from the database if you want to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2354-2
07:16:29.269 --> 07:16:33.949
<v Ricky Horton>If you maintain the pricing maintenance
from the as I enter in here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2354-3
07:16:33.949 --> 07:16:35.780
<v Ricky Horton>it just flows in, yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2355-0
07:16:36.060 --> 07:16:38.533
<v Ricky Horton>The second means,
which is what most people do,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2355-1
07:16:38.533 --> 07:16:42.500
<v Ricky Horton>got the estimating drop down and you go
to job specific pricing maintenance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2356-0
07:16:46.260 --> 07:16:50.805
<v Ricky Horton>And go up to pricing drop down at the
very top and add signs from estimate,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2356-1
07:16:50.805 --> 07:16:52.060
<v Ricky Horton>pull everything over.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2357-0
07:16:52.540 --> 07:16:52.780
<v Ricky Horton>Ever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2359-0
07:16:53.820 --> 07:16:56.726
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
you have copy prices from the database.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2359-1
07:16:56.726 --> 07:17:01.679
<v Ricky Horton>If it's if these prices in there pulls
over like this bullet read a dollar</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2359-2
07:17:01.679 --> 07:17:06.302
<v Ricky Horton>thirty-six 100 weight and then I'm
adjusting it here either by global</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2359-3
07:17:06.302 --> 07:17:10.660
<v Ricky Horton>editing or changing it like here's I'll
be changing the one line.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2360-0
07:17:13.300 --> 07:17:20.074
<v Ricky Horton>And then that locks the pricing in here,
so it's not going to change and it also</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2360-1
07:17:20.074 --> 07:17:25.258
<v Ricky Horton>puts it over there.
So this then sets up to where it gives me</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2360-2
07:17:25.258 --> 07:17:31.028
<v Ricky Horton>my pricing for estimating,
which I can then in reporting compared to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2360-3
07:17:31.028 --> 07:17:32.700
<v Ricky Horton>what my actions are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2361-0
07:17:32.900 --> 07:17:38.732
<v Ricky Horton>And then after this then you go to
purchase it and you at least have this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2361-1
07:17:38.732 --> 07:17:43.461
<v Ricky Horton>price compared to. Yeah,
can you do both questions in here?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2361-2
07:17:43.461 --> 07:17:46.140
<v Ricky Horton>Plus I have a pricing database of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2362-0
07:17:47.340 --> 07:17:53.156
<v Ricky Horton>And once a quarter,
I send it down to my vendors and they</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2362-1
07:17:53.156 --> 07:17:58.672
<v Ricky Horton>fill it in.
I can update this and then push it all in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2362-2
07:17:58.672 --> 07:18:01.780
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, I see that. Yeah, so like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2363-0
07:18:02.660 --> 07:18:07.462
<v Ricky Horton>Do more pricing,
they do the they do their updates.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2363-1
07:18:07.462 --> 07:18:14.388
<v Ricky Horton>You can pull that in a couple of months.
So that's the normal way of doing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2363-2
07:18:14.388 --> 07:18:18.820
<v Ricky Horton>material pricing so you can get right and
then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2364-0
07:18:18.940 --> 07:18:24.490
<v Ricky Horton>It will also be in the remnants,
then your drops could be done more.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2364-1
07:18:24.490 --> 07:18:31.005
<v Ricky Horton>It applies just the percentage or I can
do the bonding in here to get more exact</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2364-2
07:18:31.005 --> 07:18:33.900
<v Ricky Horton>so you know the smaller the project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2365-0
07:18:34.260 --> 07:18:38.213
<v Ricky Horton>I might have 30% scrap on the job because
it's smaller, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2365-1
07:18:38.213 --> 07:18:42.604
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas larger projects I might have 4%
scrap or something like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2365-2
07:18:42.604 --> 07:18:46.180
<v Ricky Horton>So you can combine and do whatever you
want. So pricing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2366-0
07:18:48.180 --> 07:18:54.134
<v Ricky Horton>This, this is normally happens. So.
And then, yeah, it sets it up for yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2366-1
07:18:54.134 --> 07:18:58.285
<v Ricky Horton>comparison. So.
So when you're wrapping it up again,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2366-2
07:18:58.285 --> 07:19:04.709
<v Ricky Horton>so really all you're doing this for is we
get apps is really what disappoints you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2366-3
07:19:04.709 --> 07:19:06.980
<v Ricky Horton>right now, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2367-0
07:19:07.140 --> 07:19:09.460
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty much just for hours.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2368-0
07:19:12.300 --> 07:19:15.540
<v Ricky Horton>So, you know,
do hours in here and then uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2369-0
07:19:19.500 --> 07:19:25.455
<v Ricky Horton>And then everything else is been external.
And then once once this is done,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2369-1
07:19:25.455 --> 07:19:29.999
<v Ricky Horton>the bottle's sent off,
everything's where it needs to be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2369-2
07:19:29.999 --> 07:19:34.700
<v Ricky Horton>That's when I take everything that's
production controlled.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2370-0
07:19:34.980 --> 07:19:41.531
<v Ricky Horton>And it's in the middle of my back.
So do you think that, let's see guys,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2370-1
07:19:41.531 --> 07:19:46.915
<v Ricky Horton>the wrong and talk,
are they doing the same thing with you?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2370-2
07:19:46.915 --> 07:19:48.620
<v Ricky Horton>It's using her out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2371-0
07:19:50.100 --> 07:19:53.765
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
cause they're not using it for material</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2371-1
07:19:53.765 --> 07:19:58.383
<v Ricky Horton>costing you all. No,
they'll combine it here so that they have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2371-2
07:19:58.383 --> 07:20:02.781
<v Ricky Horton>be buying rooms.
This one is exactly like keyboard. Got it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2371-3
07:20:02.781 --> 07:20:04.980
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's a bit surprising.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2372-0
07:20:05.700 --> 07:20:14.300
<v Ricky Horton>So then in here, brush control routes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2373-0
07:20:15.460 --> 07:20:19.605
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
everything and then push things through.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2373-1
07:20:19.605 --> 07:20:25.953
<v Ricky Horton>So let let let's drop back there because
we we we jumped way far ahead.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2373-2
07:20:25.953 --> 07:20:31.420
<v Ricky Horton>So we got we did the estimate and so that
goes over to Pro 4.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2374-0
07:20:32.020 --> 07:20:38.040
<v Ricky Horton>Everything gets submitted there.
Nothing else comes back in the to the in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2374-1
07:20:38.040 --> 07:20:42.189
<v Ricky Horton>the estimating when you win the job.
Advance bill.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2374-2
07:20:42.189 --> 07:20:46.500
<v Ricky Horton>You don't really do advance bills, right?
All right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2375-0
07:20:48.060 --> 07:20:52.237
<v Ricky Horton>How much materials you know?
One big picture.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2375-1
07:20:52.237 --> 07:20:57.322
<v Ricky Horton>You can send it out and say, hey, look,
I'm gonna need.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2375-2
07:20:57.322 --> 07:21:00.500
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be an e-mail this pretty soon.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2376-0
07:21:01.620 --> 07:21:08.566
<v Ricky Horton>That's the early look before you actually
finish your design. So let's go to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2376-1
07:21:08.566 --> 07:21:12.484
<v Ricky Horton>All right, you win the job,
set the job up.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2376-2
07:21:12.484 --> 07:21:16.580
<v Ricky Horton>What in project management is being
utilized?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2377-0
07:21:17.380 --> 07:21:22.259
<v Ricky Horton>As opposed to elsewhere, pretty minimal,
right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2377-1
07:21:22.259 --> 07:21:28.358
<v Ricky Horton>I think you're because with usually with
Vista and Procore,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2377-2
07:21:28.358 --> 07:21:32.220
<v Ricky Horton>a lot of that gets done elsewhere and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2378-0
07:21:34.140 --> 07:21:40.715
<v Ricky Horton>I'll say in a lot of cases rightfully so.
So RFI's, where's where RFI's been?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2378-1
07:21:40.715 --> 07:21:43.580
<v Ricky Horton>I do all of my RFI's through here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2379-0
07:21:44.820 --> 07:21:51.260
<v Ricky Horton>What about it? What about?
I'm the only one to be using that one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2380-0
07:21:53.300 --> 07:21:59.144
<v Ricky Horton>What about transmittals drawings?
Are they stored within here? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2380-1
07:21:59.144 --> 07:22:04.988
<v Ricky Horton>all of anything that I'll use
transmittals and drawing log and track</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2380-2
07:22:04.988 --> 07:22:09.900
<v Ricky Horton>all of my back and forth between here and
the other guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2381-0
07:22:10.100 --> 07:22:13.848
<v Ricky Horton>No, but the other guys don't do it.
They're it's estimating.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2381-1
07:22:13.848 --> 07:22:17.842
<v Ricky Horton>They're out of the loop.
They're able to get estimated hours and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2381-2
07:22:17.842 --> 07:22:21.528
<v Ricky Horton>they never use basically this program
again. Is that right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2381-3
07:22:21.528 --> 07:22:25.460
<v Ricky Horton>They just estimate hours and they're done
with the tagline the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2382-0
07:22:25.580 --> 07:22:29.030
<v Ricky Horton>So and and do you control all of the
drawing law?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2382-1
07:22:29.030 --> 07:22:34.757
<v Ricky Horton>I feel like we're grilling it. I'm sorry,
do do you control all of the drawing law</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2382-2
07:22:34.757 --> 07:22:38.897
<v Ricky Horton>and transmittals for everything that runs
through here? OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2382-3
07:22:38.897 --> 07:22:42.761
<v Ricky Horton>so all all the out for approval,
everything is in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2382-4
07:22:42.761 --> 07:22:44.900
<v Ricky Horton>You can see what draws are out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2383-0
07:22:45.500 --> 07:22:50.100
<v Ricky Horton>OK, um, we're going to need that and I.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2384-0
07:22:50.820 --> 07:22:55.073
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe the only one, yeah,
none of the other project engineers that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2384-1
07:22:55.073 --> 07:22:58.779
<v Ricky Horton>interface with any of their customers are
using this format.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2384-2
07:22:58.779 --> 07:23:02.364
<v Ricky Horton>They're using a smaller system that I'm
not. But are they,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2384-3
07:23:02.364 --> 07:23:06.860
<v Ricky Horton>is that work that runs through this
facility or sometimes it is work that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2384-4
07:23:06.860 --> 07:23:08.500
<v Ricky Horton>runs through this facility.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2385-0
07:23:08.980 --> 07:23:11.716
<v Ricky Horton>They'll but most of the time when I see
it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2385-1
07:23:11.716 --> 07:23:16.441
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's in a project coordinated
request one for this is the work that he</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2385-2
07:23:16.441 --> 07:23:19.922
<v Ricky Horton>pushed through.
They've already worked through all that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2385-3
07:23:19.922 --> 07:23:24.460
<v Ricky Horton>background stuff all the time.
So there's there's work that you guys do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2386-0
07:23:25.380 --> 07:23:31.134
<v Ricky Horton>That somebody else has control and they
handle all that out for approval and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2386-1
07:23:31.134 --> 07:23:35.392
<v Ricky Horton>transmittal and drive along all that
somewhere else. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2386-2
07:23:35.392 --> 07:23:40.772
<v Ricky Horton>even though it's the same company,
the the only stuff that's trapped in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2386-3
07:23:40.772 --> 07:23:41.220
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2387-0
07:23:41.700 --> 07:23:46.881
<v Ricky Horton>For transmittals, RFI's, drawing log,
back and forth between detailers and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2387-1
07:23:46.881 --> 07:23:50.542
<v Ricky Horton>approval stages is my projects and things
that I do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2387-2
07:23:50.542 --> 07:23:55.861
<v Ricky Horton>So the other guys are probably using a
spreadsheet or something to track all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2387-3
07:23:55.861 --> 07:24:01.180
<v Ricky Horton>that stuff or whatever change order logs.
They've got all sort of different.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2388-0
07:24:01.700 --> 07:24:04.414
<v Ricky Horton>Different interfaces and and different
things.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2388-1
07:24:04.414 --> 07:24:09.092
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have any exchange orders in here
too, or do you have change orders? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2388-2
07:24:09.092 --> 07:24:13.480
<v Ricky Horton>I'll enter my change orders in here.
I haven't had any projects since we've</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2388-3
07:24:13.480 --> 07:24:17.580
<v Ricky Horton>gone through all this that I've had that
huge amount of change orders.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2389-0
07:24:17.940 --> 07:24:23.482
<v Ricky Horton>I I do still track it separately in a in
an Excel sheet log because a lot of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2389-1
07:24:23.482 --> 07:24:29.455
<v Ricky Horton>customers like to see that Excel on that
it's easier to go back and forth with it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2389-2
07:24:29.455 --> 07:24:35.140
<v Ricky Horton>But anything that I can possibly use this
program for, I use this program for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2390-0
07:24:35.260 --> 07:24:39.676
<v Ricky Horton>I made the contract and it was on and we
didn't really look at it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2390-1
07:24:39.676 --> 07:24:44.356
<v Ricky Horton>Usually when there's a business,
it's not used just because you can do</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2390-2
07:24:44.356 --> 07:24:48.244
<v Ricky Horton>whether it's pay at,
but you can do the pay at over there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2390-3
07:24:48.244 --> 07:24:52.660
<v Ricky Horton>It's got to get over there anyway.
We were going to talk about it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2391-0
07:24:53.420 --> 07:24:57.810
<v Ricky Horton>Is there a need for that? Yeah,
I saw it on our list.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2391-1
07:24:57.810 --> 07:25:04.557
<v Ricky Horton>We had it on there just because that was
a part of our action items from last time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2391-2
07:25:04.557 --> 07:25:11.060
<v Ricky Horton>of trying to figure out the importance of
it and and The thing was it was like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2392-0
07:25:11.860 --> 07:25:18.725
<v Ricky Horton>I know about it and it's all the
duplication of other things that are done</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2392-1
07:25:18.725 --> 07:25:23.851
<v Ricky Horton>external. Yep.
So it's more of a me and Mark in a large</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2392-2
07:25:23.851 --> 07:25:31.174
<v Ricky Horton>project than we want to use something
like that for something that's long drawn</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2392-3
07:25:31.174 --> 07:25:31.540
<v Ricky Horton>out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2393-0
07:25:31.540 --> 07:25:37.900
<v Ricky Horton>This looks like your projects for the for
the actual building portion.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2394-0
07:25:39.380 --> 07:25:46.924
<v Ricky Horton>How's that function?
Do you actually send the invoice or pay</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2394-1
07:25:46.924 --> 07:25:52.736
<v Ricky Horton>it to to the client or does that get
somebody?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2394-2
07:25:52.736 --> 07:25:56.940
<v Ricky Horton>Did you tell them this this month?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2395-0
07:25:57.580 --> 07:26:02.452
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's simply there's based upon whatever</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2395-1
07:26:02.452 --> 07:26:09.655
<v Ricky Horton>whatever our original agreement upon,
which is usually like, right,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2395-2
07:26:09.655 --> 07:26:12.620
<v Ricky Horton>that portion of it we'll do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2396-0
07:26:13.180 --> 07:26:19.410
<v Ricky Horton>So that's the original and then the rest
is built upon completion and then usually</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2396-1
07:26:19.410 --> 07:26:25.415
<v Ricky Horton>I'll reach me or more marketing jobs.
I don't have jobs in the last four months</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2396-2
07:26:25.415 --> 07:26:30.219
<v Ricky Horton>where you say, hey, I'm 40% this month,
the next month I'm 60%,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2396-3
07:26:30.219 --> 07:26:32.020
<v Ricky Horton>the next month I'm 100%.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2397-0
07:26:32.020 --> 07:26:38.487
<v Ricky Horton>Line was kind of that way,
but then even then that was started in in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2397-1
07:26:38.487 --> 07:26:45.798
<v Ricky Horton>November and it needed to be completed by
the the first week of December. OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2397-2
07:26:45.798 --> 07:26:51.140
<v Ricky Horton>so yeah, so you're not doing nothing,
it's it's usually.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2398-0
07:26:51.380 --> 07:26:54.780
<v Ricky Horton>Most,
not most of our projects are done over a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2398-1
07:26:54.780 --> 07:26:58.325
<v Ricky Horton>month,
so we'll we'll go through that then maybe</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2398-2

07:27:10.580 --> 07:27:16.361
<v Ricky Horton>So it's project schedule we are doing.
Yep, that's pretty much everything, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2399-1

<v Ricky Horton>Whenever we have an MMC file,
everything's uploaded in the turbo future.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2401-0

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2402-2
07:27:54.919 --> 07:27:59.780
<v Ricky Horton>So educate me a little bit.
What is triple connect going?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2404-0
07:28:00.780 --> 07:28:04.901
<v Ricky Horton>It's a model viewer and so Tribal connect
to me it's the best way.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2404-1
07:28:04.901 --> 07:28:08.038
<v Ricky Horton>I did use that when I was at ASD.
I was connected.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2404-2
07:28:08.038 --> 07:28:12.529
<v Ricky Horton>So I get straight to the model from
within tech. Yeah, yeah, I did that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2404-3
07:28:12.529 --> 07:28:16.465
<v Ricky Horton>They need more color.
I was the model based on material status.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2404-4
07:28:16.465 --> 07:28:20.340
<v Ricky Horton>We have a lot of that info as to why.
Oh my goodness, it's so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2405-0
07:28:20.780 --> 07:28:26.242
<v Ricky Horton>Awesome. Yeah. You say, OK, this is built.
It's one color. This is,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2405-1
07:28:26.242 --> 07:28:31.463
<v Ricky Horton>this is already installed.
It's another color. Yeah, I saw that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2405-2
07:28:31.463 --> 07:28:36.925
<v Ricky Horton>How did they ask you? It is.
I've talked so much stuff that way and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2405-3
07:28:36.925 --> 07:28:40.700
<v Ricky Horton>it's such a good way to get proactive on
jobs.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2406-0
07:28:40.900 --> 07:28:44.522
<v Ricky Horton>Reacted to oh ****,
we forgot this problem, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2406-1
07:28:44.522 --> 07:28:49.989
<v Ricky Horton>It's like you can say a hand up with this.
So the stuff that you're doing is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2406-2
07:28:49.989 --> 07:28:54.817
<v Ricky Horton>attaching to Trimble Connect,
but the stuff that Karam and Pock are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2406-3
07:28:54.817 --> 07:28:55.740
<v Ricky Horton>doing is not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2407-0
07:28:56.220 --> 07:29:01.105
<v Ricky Horton>Well, because it's not real.
They're not running the production.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2407-1
07:29:01.105 --> 07:29:05.388
<v Ricky Horton>But if somebody's running their jobs that
they do again,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2407-2
07:29:05.388 --> 07:29:09.220
<v Ricky Horton>some project manager over there is
running, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2408-0
07:29:10.700 --> 07:29:17.277
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I guess it depends. So electrical,
electrical isn't as OK to to be added to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2408-1
07:29:17.277 --> 07:29:21.768
<v Ricky Horton>this system.
But but Karan and they didn't right? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2408-2
07:29:21.768 --> 07:29:26.980
<v Ricky Horton>we did structural designs, right?
So who is managing those jobs?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2409-0
07:29:27.580 --> 07:29:32.705
<v Ricky Horton>If they're getting,
if they're getting production and they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2409-1
07:29:32.705 --> 07:29:37.416
<v Ricky Horton>involved with us, it's us. If if it's not,
you know, OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2409-2
07:29:37.416 --> 07:29:42.128
<v Ricky Horton>so sometimes you would manage a job that
they got, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2409-3
07:29:42.128 --> 07:29:47.500
<v Ricky Horton>and then in that case you would actually
put it in the terminal.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2410-0
07:29:47.580 --> 07:29:51.222
<v Ricky Horton>And and the times you don't get a model
here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2410-1
07:29:51.222 --> 07:29:55.497
<v Ricky Horton>is that because what's what's the reason
behind that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2410-2
07:29:55.497 --> 07:29:59.693
<v Ricky Horton>What's the cause of that I guess is what
I'm saying.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2410-3
07:29:59.693 --> 07:30:05.947
<v Ricky Horton>The only reason we wouldn't get a model,
it depends on the the project itself,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2410-4
07:30:05.947 --> 07:30:06.580
<v Ricky Horton>so like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2411-0
07:30:07.300 --> 07:30:10.319
<v Ricky Horton>Like these little runways we get,
I don't even,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2411-1
07:30:10.319 --> 07:30:15.225
<v Ricky Horton>I don't even get CAD files for those.
We have to draw all of our plate files.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2411-2
07:30:15.225 --> 07:30:18.307
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They don't give us kiss files.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2411-3
07:30:18.307 --> 07:30:23.276
<v Ricky Horton>We just get a drawing package. Yeah.
But most of those are maybe 10 assemblies</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2411-4
07:30:23.276 --> 07:30:26.420
<v Ricky Horton>at most. Some, some beans, some columns.
Yep, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2412-0
07:30:26.540 --> 07:30:31.018
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, but if you have a model,
you're you're getting, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2412-1
07:30:31.018 --> 07:30:36.036
<v Ricky Horton>so always like reference.
We're always pushing to deal with this</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2412-2
07:30:36.036 --> 07:30:40.900
<v Ricky Horton>because we want this level of visibility.
Yeah, and then also.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2413-0
07:30:41.580 --> 07:30:45.411
<v Ricky Horton>We want to run into our elements. Yeah,
yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2413-1
07:30:45.411 --> 07:30:51.656
<v Ricky Horton>that's that's teared on the same level.
Dropping back on your drawings and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2413-2
07:30:51.656 --> 07:30:55.903
<v Ricky Horton>transmittals,
are you able to get a PFXP filed and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2413-3
07:30:55.903 --> 07:30:59.900
<v Ricky Horton>important drawings? Yeah,
two reason got there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2414-0
07:31:00.300 --> 07:31:06.680
<v Ricky Horton>Through our own detailers, yes. OK, cool.
That is a part of our design standard.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2414-1
07:31:06.680 --> 07:31:12.587
<v Ricky Horton>They always supply on them for our
insurance packages that are detailed by</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2414-2
07:31:12.587 --> 07:31:15.580
<v Ricky Horton>us. Anything that's customer supplied.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2415-0
07:31:16.460 --> 07:31:21.620
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes when you control it,
you can get it, yeah, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2416-0
07:31:24.220 --> 07:31:25.820
<v Ricky Horton>So then you place your file.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2417-0
07:31:27.500 --> 07:31:27.780
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2418-0

<v Ricky Horton>In um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2419-0
07:31:32.140 --> 07:31:35.816
<v Ricky Horton>It's really the only other things in
project management there were those</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2419-1
07:31:35.816 --> 07:31:36.420
<v Ricky Horton>little tiny.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2420-0
07:31:37.820 --> 07:31:42.143
<v Ricky Horton>Journal entry and task list and check
list like things.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2420-1
07:31:42.143 --> 07:31:48.165
<v Ricky Horton>Most people weren't doing that anyway.
Even even then task list wise we don't</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2420-2
07:31:48.165 --> 07:31:52.411
<v Ricky Horton>have anything. We'll check the set up.
We aren't even.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2420-3
07:31:52.411 --> 07:31:57.660
<v Ricky Horton>I had three or four orders.
This was helpful. Yeah, I haven't seen.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2421-0
07:31:57.740 --> 07:32:03.799
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's where people, yeah, yeah,
it's it's there if people find it useful.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2421-1
07:32:03.799 --> 07:32:09.624
<v Ricky Horton>I've gone to shops where they had
searches with that on and they basically</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2421-2
07:32:09.624 --> 07:32:12.420
<v Ricky Horton>the same thing on spreadsheets list.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2422-0
07:32:12.860 --> 07:32:23.158
<v Ricky Horton>This entire checklist is based off of the
procedure that I have for project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2422-1

07:33:30.065 --> 07:33:34.154
<v Ricky Horton>work packages,
330 working and leasing add hours to work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2428-2
07:33:34.154 --> 07:33:39.176
<v Ricky Horton>packages. Once work packages complete,
generate, be a women trailers,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2428-3

<v Ricky Horton>release and break all that down the
production schedule.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2431-0
07:34:17.620 --> 07:34:23.776
<v Ricky Horton>Production schedules will be entered into
the project schedule in project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2431-1
07:34:23.776 --> 07:34:29.682
<v Ricky Horton>management and then this breaks down the
project management procedure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2431-2
07:34:29.682 --> 07:34:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>Hour breakout in the Gantture,
hour percentage updates.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2432-0
07:34:35.100 --> 07:34:41.902
<v Ricky Horton>Adjust scheduled for production,
schedule released the fabrication shop</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2432-1
07:34:41.902 --> 07:34:49.460
<v Ricky Horton>and then we fill one of these out for
every time we shoot something out to the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2433-0
07:34:50.940 --> 07:34:58.689
<v Ricky Horton>Those stuff from project management is in
that. That's pretty much everything there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2433-1
07:34:58.689 --> 07:35:02.700
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
release for Fab and production control.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2434-0
07:35:03.660 --> 07:35:09.900
<v Ricky Horton>You get a PFXP if possible, right? Yep.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2435-0
07:35:12.300 --> 07:35:13.540
<v Ricky Horton>So you imported in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2436-0
07:35:15.300 --> 07:35:15.380
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2437-0
07:35:18.220 --> 07:35:23.100
<v Ricky Horton>You're you're doing the routing. Uh.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2438-0
07:35:25.900 --> 07:35:29.372
<v Ricky Horton>You're doing the combining and everything
to purchase, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2438-1
07:35:29.372 --> 07:35:31.220
<v Ricky Horton>Are you purchasing with a little?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2439-0
07:35:33.780 --> 07:35:35.140
<v Ricky Horton>What are you grabbing?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2440-0
07:35:38.220 --> 07:35:42.901
<v Ricky Horton>They haven't figured out on yet.
I had an accident without the kids,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2440-1
07:35:42.901 --> 07:35:48.056
<v Ricky Horton>so just see how many months. Yeah,
sleep is probably what it does do. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2440-2
07:35:48.056 --> 07:35:51.380
<v Ricky Horton>it sounds like it.
Some days I try to find time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2441-0
07:35:52.380 --> 07:35:58.137
<v Ricky Horton>So you're combining and purchasing,
combining every single project we send</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2441-1
07:35:58.137 --> 07:36:01.590
<v Ricky Horton>out,
we send out to three to five vendors to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2441-2
07:36:01.590 --> 07:36:04.660
<v Ricky Horton>get competitive cost purchasing in here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2442-0
07:36:08.860 --> 07:36:13.413
<v Ricky Horton>And then we also program.
So we created all the plate mess things</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2442-1
07:36:13.413 --> 07:36:17.137
<v Ricky Horton>and PC mess things for the equipment on
the property.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2442-2
07:36:17.137 --> 07:36:21.000
<v Ricky Horton>I specifically handled any of the sub
application work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2442-3
07:36:21.000 --> 07:36:26.449
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe these federal beam line or
processing or get the teams to get rolled.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2442-4
07:36:26.449 --> 07:36:28.380
<v Ricky Horton>That's something I specific.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2443-0
07:36:28.460 --> 07:36:34.340
<v Ricky Horton>Handle OK and then I'll attract all that
to transmittals. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2444-0
07:36:36.140 --> 07:36:42.275
<v Ricky Horton>And then we create the work packages and
then it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2444-1
07:36:42.275 --> 07:36:50.740
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess once everything's imported,
sequence the mod accordingly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2445-0
07:36:51.180 --> 07:36:54.420
<v Ricky Horton>And it was routed and then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2447-0
07:36:56.860 --> 07:37:01.594
<v Ricky Horton>Work packages and then Douglas and then
final reports,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2447-1
07:37:01.594 --> 07:37:07.705
<v Ricky Horton>just so that our BLM reflects work
packages and everything in the shot</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2447-2
07:37:07.705 --> 07:37:14.333
<v Ricky Horton>traveler and we see all those reports.
Everything's all structured the same,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2447-3
07:37:14.333 --> 07:37:16.140
<v Ricky Horton>so if we go into any.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2448-0
07:37:16.620 --> 07:37:25.980
<v Ricky Horton>In these folders, see our releases,
sequence one, lot one, shop reports.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2449-0
07:37:27.500 --> 07:37:30.803
<v Ricky Horton>I ended up releasing multiple sequences
on this,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2449-1
07:37:30.803 --> 07:37:34.983
<v Ricky Horton>but everything gets bill of materials,
everything's Traveler,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2449-2
07:37:34.983 --> 07:37:40.038
<v Ricky Horton>bring down a cut list, pull list,
pull list for plate and that goes out to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2449-3
07:37:40.038 --> 07:37:43.543
<v Ricky Horton>the shop.
This goes out to the shop floor if if you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2449-4
07:37:43.543 --> 07:37:45.700
<v Ricky Horton>got 10, let's move out the shop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2450-0
07:37:45.980 --> 07:37:50.934
<v Ricky Horton>Just because this has kind of just been a
part of our procedure,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2450-1
07:37:50.934 --> 07:37:56.954
<v Ricky Horton>now that we typically at this point still
haven't paid about a full request to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2450-2
07:37:56.954 --> 07:38:01.755
<v Ricky Horton>everyone on two equipment.
So that like one or two over done a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2450-3
07:38:01.755 --> 07:38:05.260
<v Ricky Horton>notary level plus the physical people
report.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2451-0
07:38:08.700 --> 07:38:15.100
<v Ricky Horton>They have it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2452-0
07:38:22.060 --> 07:38:26.580
<v Ricky Horton>And also part of it's just so that we
have record of it as well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2453-0
07:38:27.900 --> 07:38:36.044
<v Ricky Horton>Then at this point, you know the original,
and what's the shop traveler?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2453-1
07:38:36.044 --> 07:38:37.940
<v Ricky Horton>Shop traveler is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2454-0
07:38:38.700 --> 07:38:44.555
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially just the assemblies and
quantities that are associated in that</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2454-1
07:38:44.555 --> 07:38:48.380
<v Ricky Horton>inspection fit, fit or well,
can they feel that?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2455-0
07:38:49.340 --> 07:38:52.754
<v Ricky Horton>No, they no longer use.
They no longer use.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2455-1
07:38:52.754 --> 07:38:56.322
<v Ricky Horton>That's what it was for. Yeah,
they no longer.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2455-2
07:38:56.322 --> 07:38:59.580
<v Ricky Horton>They're piece tracking everything all all.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2456-0
07:39:00.980 --> 07:39:01.140
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2457-0
07:39:07.100 --> 07:39:13.324
<v Ricky Horton>The areas where we couldn't go away from
any of this, because that, yeah, I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2457-1
07:39:13.324 --> 07:39:19.017
<v Ricky Horton>you know the danger of paper cutting this
and revisions that that's, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2457-2
07:39:19.017 --> 07:39:23.343
<v Ricky Horton>that that can be solved hasn't burned us
in a long time,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2457-3
07:39:23.343 --> 07:39:25.620
<v Ricky Horton>but it's definitely burned us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2458-0
07:39:26.620 --> 07:39:30.652
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.
So I could tell some bad stories,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2458-1
07:39:30.652 --> 07:39:37.664
<v Ricky Horton>obviously. But then, yeah, all of our,
all of our playlist things started here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2458-2
07:39:37.664 --> 07:39:41.958
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
this is what needs to be maintained with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2458-3
07:39:41.958 --> 07:39:46.340
<v Ricky Horton>the latest revision of everything when
you think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2459-0
07:39:46.380 --> 07:39:48.780
<v Ricky Horton>Hold this footage to the thread folder.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2460-0
07:39:50.020 --> 07:39:57.740
<v Ricky Horton>Anything new is updated in here and then
also updated in echo as well so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2461-0
07:39:59.820 --> 07:40:00.100
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2462-0
07:40:03.300 --> 07:40:03.620
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2463-0
07:40:11.740 --> 07:40:15.462
<v Ricky Horton>And once,
once we have all of that information</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2463-1
07:40:15.462 --> 07:40:19.025
<v Ricky Horton>pulled,
put together and added things to the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2463-2
07:40:19.025 --> 07:40:22.984
<v Ricky Horton>drawing log,
which we can take a look here in the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2463-3
07:40:22.984 --> 07:40:27.260
<v Ricky Horton>project management chapter for this,
then we'll take.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2464-0
07:40:27.500 --> 07:40:33.513
<v Ricky Horton>All those sharp reports, all the drawings,
everything converting into what we're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2464-1
07:40:33.513 --> 07:40:39.155
<v Ricky Horton>planning and releasing them before
they've been added to the drawing along.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2464-2
07:40:39.155 --> 07:40:43.980
<v Ricky Horton>So all of that is all saved in here and
in the associated areas.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2465-0
07:40:44.060 --> 07:40:50.594
<v Ricky Horton>And then transmittals are created for any
of our shop releases that are sent to the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2465-1
07:40:50.594 --> 07:40:51.060
<v Ricky Horton>board.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2466-0
07:40:53.420 --> 07:40:59.627
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
And then once all that is all put in here,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2466-1
07:40:59.627 --> 07:41:04.060
<v Ricky Horton>we'll then e-mail that portion out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2467-0
07:41:11.020 --> 07:41:16.300
<v Ricky Horton>Now this is my multiple bot shot release.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2468-0
07:41:22.740 --> 07:41:27.171
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially all the information I had
broke down in there when the materials</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2468-1
07:41:27.171 --> 07:41:30.853
<v Ricky Horton>coming in, pertinent notes,
quarter seven bottom plates will be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2468-2
07:41:30.853 --> 07:41:35.399
<v Ricky Horton>processed in the following phases since
all of those are when we cut the size,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2468-3
07:41:35.399 --> 07:41:37.700
<v Ricky Horton>anticipated deliver radius of materials.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2469-0
07:41:38.220 --> 07:41:44.310
<v Ricky Horton>And then any specific notes and then
right down to our later codes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2469-1
07:41:44.310 --> 07:41:50.400
<v Ricky Horton>This one is on the boxes,
so each box's length had its own sequence</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2469-2
07:41:50.400 --> 07:41:54.340
<v Ricky Horton>and locked in the hours associated with
it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2470-0
07:41:56.860 --> 07:42:01.529
<v Ricky Horton>Coatings layer codes,
coding specs and then production</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2470-1
07:42:01.529 --> 07:42:06.623
<v Ricky Horton>schedules for each.
So submit the information that may turn</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2470-2
07:42:06.623 --> 07:42:08.660
<v Ricky Horton>into project management.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2471-0
07:42:10.780 --> 07:42:14.860
<v Ricky Horton>Are all of those lots a?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2472-0
07:42:15.820 --> 07:42:17.380
<v Ricky Horton>Separate work package.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2473-0
07:42:20.700 --> 07:42:20.900
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2474-0
07:42:24.180 --> 07:42:31.650
<v Ricky Horton>You know we I'll I'll apologize ahead of
time. You know we're not on news on this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2474-1
07:42:31.650 --> 07:42:34.620
<v Ricky Horton>All that's on good, you know, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2475-0
07:42:35.260 --> 07:42:41.214
<v Ricky Horton>That takes a lot of time to talk about.
I'm just, I'm lazy, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2475-1
07:42:41.214 --> 07:42:47.423
<v Ricky Horton>is it needed or is it just spoon feeding?
You know, spoon feeding. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2475-2
07:42:47.423 --> 07:42:52.100
<v Ricky Horton>this is also what we use for updates for
the team, so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2476-0
07:42:53.700 --> 07:42:56.978
<v Ricky Horton>Um, oftentimes,
I think this one's a little bit different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2476-1
07:42:56.978 --> 07:43:00.707
<v Ricky Horton>because the PM and the PE are obviously
both marking there. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2476-2
07:43:00.707 --> 07:43:05.001
<v Ricky Horton>but a lot of times it'll be the other PE
that we have found on this e-mail.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2476-3
07:43:05.001 --> 07:43:09.804
<v Ricky Horton>So if there are any delays with material,
it's supposed to go to this e-mail thread.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2476-4
07:43:09.804 --> 07:43:13.420
<v Ricky Horton>So that way it's easily tracked for
everyone. Um, if there are.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2477-0
07:43:13.500 --> 07:43:18.250
<v Ricky Horton>Are once that the project is completely
complete and it's moving into codings,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2477-1
07:43:18.250 --> 07:43:23.061
<v Ricky Horton>we're supposed to have an item who will
send another e-mail updating this. Hey,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2477-2
07:43:23.061 --> 07:43:26.849
<v Ricky Horton>this is not complete.
Coding is supposed to be the same thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2477-3
07:43:26.849 --> 07:43:31.960
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't get realized the way it should,
but that's how it's certainly said to go,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2477-4
07:43:31.960 --> 07:43:32.260
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2478-0
07:43:32.780 --> 07:43:36.546
<v Ricky Horton>So and all that can be done with
automated reports.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2478-1
07:43:36.546 --> 07:43:42.629
<v Ricky Horton>I have no sympathy for people who are too
lazy to go look at the system and not and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2478-2
07:43:42.629 --> 07:43:46.974
<v Ricky Horton>then look up that stuff.
I have 0 sympathy oriented people.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2478-3
07:43:46.974 --> 07:43:52.260
<v Ricky Horton>The problem is that what that turns into
though is just them calling us.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2479-0
07:43:52.660 --> 07:43:58.351
<v Ricky Horton>And asking for an update and I'll end up
on the system. Well, but yeah, you're,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2479-1
07:43:58.351 --> 07:44:01.836
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
like on a totem pole you were probably</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2479-2
07:44:01.836 --> 07:44:05.108
<v Ricky Horton>pretty high there.
It's like we're down here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2479-3
07:44:05.108 --> 07:44:10.300
<v Ricky Horton>I can tell those guys that they,
but those project managers and project.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2480-0
07:44:10.340 --> 07:44:13.300
<v Ricky Horton>Do they all have that one?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2481-0
07:44:16.460 --> 07:44:23.660
<v Ricky Horton>Once we are involved in instructional
missing kids, do they have a new tech?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2482-0
07:44:26.020 --> 07:44:26.220
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2483-0
07:44:29.900 --> 07:44:36.208
<v Ricky Horton>That's a good place that they were using
it for me. I've used it some,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2483-1
07:44:36.208 --> 07:44:38.340
<v Ricky Horton>so all the time now the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2484-0
07:44:39.420 --> 07:44:45.855
<v Ricky Horton>I'll I'll say the the danger here is you
two guys go somewhere else.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2484-1
07:44:45.855 --> 07:44:51.543
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody else in this company knows what's
going on, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2484-2
07:44:51.543 --> 07:44:55.180
<v Ricky Horton>you know something and and that's that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2485-0
07:44:55.260 --> 07:44:59.230
<v Ricky Horton>And and that's not just a yeah, well,
sure.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2485-1
07:44:59.230 --> 07:45:06.358
<v Ricky Horton>I've been to there's a shop in Brooklyn.
I've been to three times because they</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2485-2
07:45:06.358 --> 07:45:11.140
<v Ricky Horton>lost their YouTube guys twice and they
did it right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2486-0
07:45:11.420 --> 07:45:19.389
<v Ricky Horton>It's because nobody else looked at
anything. So that it would be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2486-1
07:45:19.389 --> 07:45:27.600
<v Ricky Horton>And I don't know, I'm pretty sure.
So yeah, yeah, we're definitely,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2486-2
07:45:27.600 --> 07:45:30.980
<v Ricky Horton>definitely on the same page.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2487-0
07:45:31.620 --> 07:45:37.873
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they seem really interested in tech,
even this morning. They're all in. Yes,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2487-1
07:45:37.873 --> 07:45:43.447
<v Ricky Horton>like they're all in all your PM,
all your project engineers and everybody</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2487-2
07:45:43.447 --> 07:45:47.063
<v Ricky Horton>needs the PEX and and the PE is admin on.
Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2487-3
07:45:47.063 --> 07:45:50.980
<v Ricky Horton>there's all the all the information is
there. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-0
07:45:51.340 --> 07:45:55.148
<v Ricky Horton>I've been they were using checkbook.
They did all of this stuff that he's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-1
07:45:55.148 --> 07:45:57.515
<v Ricky Horton>pointing out.
They were the ones that did the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-2
07:45:57.515 --> 07:46:00.140
<v Ricky Horton>transmittals.
They were the ones that did the RFI.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-3
07:46:00.140 --> 07:46:03.124
<v Ricky Horton>They were the ones that took the drawing
from the system.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-4
07:46:03.124 --> 07:46:06.572
<v Ricky Horton>They fill out all the stuff.
They were the ones that pulled up the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-5
07:46:06.572 --> 07:46:10.226
<v Ricky Horton>triple connect and said, OK,
I got this checked out, this checked out,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2488-6
07:46:10.226 --> 07:46:11.100
<v Ricky Horton>this checked out.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2489-0
07:46:11.100 --> 07:46:11.620
<v Ricky Horton>To doing that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2490-0
07:46:12.700 --> 07:46:14.180
<v Ricky Horton>The system 10.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2491-0
07:46:16.300 --> 07:46:20.729
<v Ricky Horton>That's what it is.
All the brothers and all and project</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2491-1
07:46:20.729 --> 07:46:26.027
<v Ricky Horton>managers, they're all on it.
They all do all that stuff within the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2491-2
07:46:26.027 --> 07:46:26.580
<v Ricky Horton>system.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2492-0
07:46:27.740 --> 07:46:32.590
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I think is to be here. Yeah,
yeah, it is. In other words,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2492-1
07:46:32.590 --> 07:46:38.062
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not talking about that's going to be
all, that's something you might need.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2492-2
07:46:38.062 --> 07:46:41.942
<v Ricky Horton>If anybody has to be on 100% on this,
I see it at work.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2492-3
07:46:41.942 --> 07:46:46.860
<v Ricky Horton>And then this honestly is an uncommon
analog. We we buy ours with you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2493-0
07:46:47.420 --> 07:46:51.338
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
the the ones that are like you were</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2493-1
07:46:51.338 --> 07:46:56.108
<v Ricky Horton>talking about,
the ones that are have everybody looking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2493-2
07:46:56.108 --> 07:47:01.900
<v Ricky Horton>in there, man pays off so much.
We also have the purchasing agents.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2494-0
07:47:01.940 --> 07:47:06.637
<v Ricky Horton>I mean four or five project managers,
five or six project engineers,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2494-1
07:47:06.637 --> 07:47:11.266
<v Ricky Horton>all those people were using it all in all.
And then the estimators,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2494-2
07:47:11.266 --> 07:47:14.397
<v Ricky Horton>it's like 3 or 4 estimators using it as
well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2494-3
07:47:14.397 --> 07:47:17.460
<v Ricky Horton>They got about 15 people using it back
home.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2496-0
07:47:18.820 --> 07:47:24.504
<v Ricky Horton>300 tons a week. They do a lot.
They're doing 60 million a year plus.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2496-1
07:47:24.504 --> 07:47:28.644
<v Ricky Horton>When I left them a year and a half ago,
they were,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2496-2
07:47:28.644 --> 07:47:32.460
<v Ricky Horton>they were trying to get to 100 million a
year.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2497-0
07:47:34.700 --> 07:47:39.066
<v Ricky Horton>There's a tree I've been working on for
years.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2497-1
07:47:39.066 --> 07:47:43.803
<v Ricky Horton>It's about two feet in front of me and
falls flat.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2497-2
07:47:43.803 --> 07:47:51.048
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think we're working at all.
Based on when they told me how interested</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2497-3
07:47:51.048 --> 07:47:54.020
<v Ricky Horton>they were going forward with it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2498-0
07:47:54.340 --> 07:47:57.986
<v Ricky Horton>This morning when I talked to him,
since I knew about,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2498-1
07:47:57.986 --> 07:48:02.095
<v Ricky Horton>since I've had LinkedIn,
I've been following Ricky and I have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2498-2
07:48:02.095 --> 07:48:07.597
<v Ricky Horton>followed everything that you do out there.
I've been blessing you to come here for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2498-3
07:48:07.597 --> 07:48:10.844
<v Ricky Horton>years.
It wasn't until we became long ago and we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2498-4
07:48:10.844 --> 07:48:12.700
<v Ricky Horton>finally gave the investment.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2499-0
07:48:13.100 --> 07:48:17.033
<v Ricky Horton>And now they're trying to push more
things. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2499-1
07:48:17.033 --> 07:48:21.832
<v Ricky Horton>it has been a I didn't see a great idea.
I'm not sure. Yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2499-2
07:48:21.832 --> 07:48:27.259
<v Ricky Horton>Does somebody have the other volume that
they use? That's technical.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2499-3
07:48:27.259 --> 07:48:29.540
<v Ricky Horton>Their their goal is, I think.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2500-0
07:48:29.540 --> 07:48:34.856
<v Ricky Horton>The the So this call came from Lonro.
They want to be in tech or it came from</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2500-1
07:48:34.856 --> 07:48:39.763
<v Ricky Horton>us and we pushed it for them.
They saw how well we they saw how well we</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2500-2
07:48:39.763 --> 07:48:42.420
<v Ricky Horton>offered. Oh OK and and I still feel it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2501-0
07:48:43.980 --> 07:48:48.420
<v Ricky Horton>You guys are barely doing it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2502-0
07:48:49.620 --> 07:48:54.918
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. What?
What's you're using before you do the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2502-1
07:48:54.918 --> 07:49:00.745
<v Ricky Horton>virtual app? Yeah,
certainly it can be expanded. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2502-2
07:49:00.745 --> 07:49:07.101
<v Ricky Horton>absolutely. Perfect.
That's the that's the truth on some of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2502-3
07:49:07.101 --> 07:49:09.220
<v Ricky Horton>these other systems.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2503-0
07:49:09.620 --> 07:49:13.609
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
it just seems like you're double at least</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2503-1
07:49:13.609 --> 07:49:17.439
<v Ricky Horton>all working. Yeah, that's true.
I think so too.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2503-2
07:49:17.439 --> 07:49:22.306
<v Ricky Horton>Every quarter I hear about this.
So after every quarter, OK,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2503-3
07:49:22.306 --> 07:49:24.300
<v Ricky Horton>after the release and so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2504-0
07:49:24.980 --> 07:49:34.420
<v Ricky Horton>Receiving is that's we we're working on
getting that done out there. So then.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2505-0
07:49:36.380 --> 07:49:46.778
<v Ricky Horton>It's yours should be should be received.
It should be received.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2505-1
07:49:46.778 --> 07:49:54.900
<v Ricky Horton>It's doing it yours. Well, it's also. Yes,
it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2506-0
07:49:55.620 --> 07:49:58.443
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
so you can look up and sit back on this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2506-1
07:49:58.443 --> 07:50:03.461
<v Ricky Horton>He's helping me when we're sitting there
and it's probably less to have a piece</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2506-2
07:50:03.461 --> 07:50:08.604
<v Ricky Horton>side for more than. Let's say, I mean,
he's sent back the rest of the yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2506-3
07:50:08.604 --> 07:50:11.740
<v Ricky Horton>all I have to that job. OK,
you can build it for.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2507-0
07:50:11.940 --> 07:50:17.143
<v Ricky Horton>Can you show him?
I think it would basically just be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2507-1
07:50:17.143 --> 07:50:24.370
<v Ricky Horton>So if this question was if he needed to
look up a job for all of the HDRS,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2507-2
07:50:24.370 --> 07:50:27.260
<v Ricky Horton>we'll have a form. He's a guy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2508-0
07:50:27.540 --> 07:50:31.363
<v Ricky Horton>I need the money. All right.
You don't have to show me this piece of</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2508-1
07:50:31.363 --> 07:50:34.908
<v Ricky Horton>egg offline for a job.
It's literally got 3 clicks once you get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2508-2
07:50:34.908 --> 07:50:37.733
<v Ricky Horton>a new job. So yeah.
So they started where we were.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2508-3
07:50:37.733 --> 07:50:42.109
<v Ricky Horton>It was cumbersome because you had to know
all the purchase orders and then you</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2508-4
07:50:42.109 --> 07:50:45.820
<v Ricky Horton>could pull the purchase orders in one by
one. It's horrible, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2509-0
07:50:47.220 --> 07:50:49.820
<v Ricky Horton>To review TFS details, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2510-0
07:50:54.260 --> 07:50:58.205
<v Ricky Horton>Man, that is sweet.
There's very few without one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2510-1
07:50:58.205 --> 07:51:03.886
<v Ricky Horton>I I can't tell you that. I mean,
you can imagine most shots I get into.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2510-2
07:51:03.886 --> 07:51:09.488
<v Ricky Horton>I'll see 90% are not in there,
but I can even the ones without the box</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2510-3
07:51:09.488 --> 07:51:11.460
<v Ricky Horton>goes with batch edits so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2511-0
07:51:11.580 --> 07:51:19.627
<v Ricky Horton>One of these that has a multiple,
this one probably has the numbers for all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2511-1
07:51:19.627 --> 07:51:24.180
<v Ricky Horton>this.
So they just sign documents that all</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2511-2
07:51:24.180 --> 07:51:25.980
<v Ricky Horton>after the falter.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2512-0
07:51:26.580 --> 07:51:30.071
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
save documents and then you can also get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2512-1
07:51:30.071 --> 07:51:34.726
<v Ricky Horton>a report that gives you piece mark like
each number by by everyone.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2512-2
07:51:34.726 --> 07:51:38.697
<v Ricky Horton>And you guys don't have to do any MTR
review here, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2512-3
07:51:38.697 --> 07:51:42.119
<v Ricky Horton>I've only had a few customers that have
replaced.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2512-4
07:51:42.119 --> 07:51:46.500
<v Ricky Horton>You could think that the AISC audit would
be all over together.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2513-0
07:51:46.500 --> 07:51:49.422
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I see.
And he showed agree to keep all this. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2513-1
07:51:49.422 --> 07:51:52.822
<v Ricky Horton>OK, yeah, there we go.
And it saved in the the job folder also.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2513-2
07:51:52.822 --> 07:51:56.912
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, so that's where he saved them.
And that's how he pulls them. Yeah, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2513-3
07:51:56.912 --> 07:51:59.675
<v Ricky Horton>when you.
I don't understand why they're in the job</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2513-4
07:51:59.675 --> 07:52:03.340
<v Ricky Horton>folder. When you get check, pull it up.
You gotta save it somewhere.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2514-0
07:52:03.620 --> 07:52:07.992
<v Ricky Horton>So I think that's kind of here.
Here we go. We go on to this project,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2514-1
07:52:07.992 --> 07:52:11.114
<v Ricky Horton>we go to the front, should be received,
received.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2514-2
07:52:11.114 --> 07:52:15.048
<v Ricky Horton>You would think it'd be in the MPR folder
that you have there.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2514-3
07:52:15.048 --> 07:52:19.856
<v Ricky Horton>I don't really understand why we have
that because it's no, you should have.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2514-4
07:52:19.856 --> 07:52:23.540
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, like I said,
you think that's where you just double.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2515-0
07:52:23.620 --> 07:52:25.020
<v Ricky Horton>But they're literally saved.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2516-0
07:52:26.700 --> 07:52:30.409
<v Ricky Horton>In here for at least if you have it, yes,
yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2516-1
07:52:30.409 --> 07:52:33.980
<v Ricky Horton>So the the reason we have an MCR folder
is because.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2517-0
07:52:35.220 --> 07:52:39.004
<v Ricky Horton>That's ASME shop.
You had certain ones definitely had to be</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2517-1
07:52:39.004 --> 07:52:42.221
<v Ricky Horton>reviewed.
We wouldn't put them into the MTR folder</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2517-2
07:52:42.221 --> 07:52:43.860
<v Ricky Horton>until they see review the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2518-0
07:52:45.700 --> 07:52:49.820
<v Ricky Horton>The thing about the if if you just go
back to the folder to pull everything.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2519-0
07:52:50.580 --> 07:52:54.709
<v Ricky Horton>That takes away your ability to be able
to swap heat numbers at the machine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2519-1
07:52:54.709 --> 07:52:59.105
<v Ricky Horton>So like if the one we bought for the job
is over the bottom of the stack of Tina,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2519-2
07:52:59.105 --> 07:53:02.107
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not going to take that out.
I'm holding one up top,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2519-3
07:53:02.107 --> 07:53:05.860
<v Ricky Horton>going to the machine and I'm swapping the
heat number at the machine.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2520-0
07:53:06.100 --> 07:53:11.010
<v Ricky Horton>And then it's going to record the problem
one year, but it won't.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2520-1
07:53:11.010 --> 07:53:16.068
<v Ricky Horton>You got to grab it out of hold or it
won't be the right one, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2520-2
07:53:16.068 --> 07:53:20.457
<v Ricky Horton>So it doesn't swap. So. But yeah,
that's cool. That looks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2520-3
07:53:20.457 --> 07:53:22.540
<v Ricky Horton>That looks awesome. It does.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2521-0
07:53:23.660 --> 07:53:30.956
<v Ricky Horton>So then cutting, pick list,
cutting on getting OK then then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2521-1
07:53:30.956 --> 07:53:35.820
<v Ricky Horton>everything else is happening on getting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2522-0
07:53:36.740 --> 07:53:42.262
<v Ricky Horton>The time tracking on the base tracking,
probably they've been using the time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2522-1
07:53:42.262 --> 07:53:47.066
<v Ricky Horton>tracking through tech button.
They've been using the time tracking</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2522-2
07:53:47.066 --> 07:53:48.500

07:53:50.420 --> 07:53:57.846
<v Ricky Horton>Have you into it? Yeah. OK, yeah,
I think it's been at least two years or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2523-1
07:53:57.846 --> 07:54:02.060
<v Ricky Horton>so.
So you're so we're looking at today's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2523-2
07:54:02.060 --> 07:54:07.980
<v Ricky Horton>label for now. Yeah,
you go into the time tracking detail.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2526-0
07:54:14.100 --> 07:54:21.500
<v Ricky Horton>So much today. I really have. Well,
especially on this side, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2527-0
07:54:25.460 --> 07:54:28.220
<v Ricky Horton>It's OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2528-0
07:54:43.100 --> 07:54:49.082
<v Ricky Horton>So these are all of our time entries.
That's really good one.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2528-1
07:54:49.082 --> 07:54:51.300
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I have that so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2529-0
07:54:53.060 --> 07:55:00.567
<v Ricky Horton>We have a lot of data on their leaves and
then the mandatory stretches they have to</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2529-1
07:55:00.567 --> 07:55:06.466
<v Ricky Horton>do in the morning for safety.
That's that's like stretcher. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2529-2
07:55:06.466 --> 07:55:11.649
<v Ricky Horton>it's literally.
I thought that was the guy's nickname the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2529-3
07:55:11.649 --> 07:55:12.900
<v Ricky Horton>first stretch.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2530-0
07:55:12.900 --> 07:55:16.138
<v Ricky Horton>That's a lot.
I've never seen that in the shop before.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2530-1
07:55:16.138 --> 07:55:20.200
<v Ricky Horton>I've only seen that in the field. No,
it's it is required. Everyone,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2530-2
07:55:20.200 --> 07:55:24.792
<v Ricky Horton>the guys are out there stretching.
Is this a 5 minute thing or something? No,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2530-3
07:55:24.792 --> 07:55:27.794
<v Ricky Horton>it's very solid. Yeah,
it's it's solid stretchers.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2530-4
07:55:27.794 --> 07:55:31.620
<v Ricky Horton>How much are shopping in Massachusetts?
That's the only minutes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2531-0
07:55:31.620 --> 07:55:36.255
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
they're playing all over their their</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2531-1
07:55:36.255 --> 07:55:41.753
<v Ricky Horton>safety talk.
So there's we're up straight in this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2531-2
07:55:41.753 --> 07:55:48.220
<v Ricky Horton>Spread some flex in a in a you know
tailgate talk. OK, JSA.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2532-0
07:55:48.500 --> 07:55:55.955
<v Ricky Horton>OK, Job safety analysis in the shop. Yes,
each project has to have a JSA filled out</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2532-1
07:55:55.955 --> 07:56:00.482
<v Ricky Horton>for it.
So they have a separate JSA's in the shop.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2532-2
07:56:00.482 --> 07:56:02.700
<v Ricky Horton>I see JSA's in the field.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2533-0
07:56:03.700 --> 07:56:07.309
<v Ricky Horton>That's good.
I didn't say it's a bad thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2533-1
07:56:07.309 --> 07:56:12.559
<v Ricky Horton>I just said I haven't seen it before.
Just saying, just saying,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2533-2
07:56:12.559 --> 07:56:19.202
<v Ricky Horton>just keep me in mind because we were kind
of talking about the start shop on the</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2533-3
07:56:19.202 --> 07:56:19.940
<v Ricky Horton>stations.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2534-0
07:56:21.300 --> 07:56:26.387
<v Ricky Horton>It will be in addition to this. Yeah.
So it's that time though.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2534-1
07:56:26.387 --> 07:56:33.062
<v Ricky Horton>So everyone in TJ will be over this every
day and check their face scanning against</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2534-2
07:56:33.062 --> 07:56:36.798
<v Ricky Horton>what they have.
Where does that 30 minutes go?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2534-3
07:56:36.798 --> 07:56:39.420
<v Ricky Horton>1200 indirect. OK, it's indirect.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2535-0
07:56:39.780 --> 07:56:45.720
<v Ricky Horton>Got it. Oh, I see. That's the job.
And it pulls lunch out of here</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2535-1
07:56:45.720 --> 07:56:53.010
<v Ricky Horton>automatically out of there all day. No,
no, no. It's far influence part back in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2535-2
07:56:53.010 --> 07:56:54.180
<v Ricky Horton>We'll verify.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2536-0
07:56:55.380 --> 07:57:02.180
<v Ricky Horton>That'd be hours from here,
travel for 7 AM priority or the next.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2537-0
07:57:04.540 --> 07:57:10.420
<v Ricky Horton>What would you change about the time
tracking near me today?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2538-0
07:57:10.460 --> 07:57:14.490
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
one that this integration would be nice</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2538-1
07:57:14.490 --> 07:57:19.570
<v Ricky Horton>being able to establish the engineering
and the converse.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2538-2
07:57:19.570 --> 07:57:22.460
<v Ricky Horton>The other thing would be is it's.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2540-0
07:57:25.020 --> 07:57:29.020
<v Ricky Horton>And I guess I've used different
interfaces at shops,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2540-1
07:57:29.020 --> 07:57:34.228
<v Ricky Horton>most of them on a computer,
your job and how long you're on and then</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2540-2
07:57:34.228 --> 07:57:37.020
<v Ricky Horton>clocking in and out of it physically.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2541-0
07:57:38.380 --> 07:57:44.106
<v Ricky Horton>And this one in EPM Go can be a pain in
the *** when you're typing things in.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2541-1
07:57:44.106 --> 07:57:47.335
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that is not adding notes to it sucks.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2541-2
07:57:47.335 --> 07:57:52.620
<v Ricky Horton>I thought I was gonna say that.
So that would be that would be the main</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2541-3
07:57:52.620 --> 07:57:53.060
<v Ricky Horton>thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2542-0
07:57:54.180 --> 07:57:59.752
<v Ricky Horton>Obviously I don't have strike by time in
this fashion, so no work up my back,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2542-1
07:57:59.752 --> 07:58:04.752
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm sure few guys have some choice
words to say about that. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2542-2
07:58:04.752 --> 07:58:09.180
<v Ricky Horton>and then well, as you can see though,
it's just it gets very.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2543-0
07:58:10.340 --> 07:58:15.597
<v Ricky Horton>Cumbersome for a guy if he's jumping in
between jobs or like jumping 9-4 or</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2543-1
07:58:15.597 --> 07:58:19.402
<v Ricky Horton>jumping in between, um,
stations going from, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2543-2
07:58:19.402 --> 07:58:23.622
<v Ricky Horton>fit up to whatever,
you gotta go to the tablet punch in. Uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2543-3
07:58:23.622 --> 07:58:28.118
<v Ricky Horton>I think this works a lot.
A lot of the shops are moving in those</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2543-4
07:58:28.118 --> 07:58:28.740
<v Ricky Horton>stations.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-0
07:58:28.940 --> 07:58:32.184
<v Ricky Horton>It's a computer over there.
I got to get off my break list.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-1
07:58:32.184 --> 07:58:36.130
<v Ricky Horton>I got to shut my breaks off because it's
not safe. And I got to go over.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-2
07:58:36.130 --> 07:58:40.130
<v Ricky Horton>I got to log in and then I got to enter
my stuff, enter my job, clock in,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-3
07:58:40.130 --> 07:58:42.725
<v Ricky Horton>clock out of my job or clock into the
next job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-4
07:58:42.725 --> 07:58:47.049
<v Ricky Horton>And then I go back and I'm in the same
station and I got my materials and I get</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2544-5
07:58:47.049 --> 07:58:47.860
<v Ricky Horton>back and forth.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2545-0
07:58:48.220 --> 07:58:52.951
<v Ricky Horton>This you got to tap it right here,
go into, go along with this job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2545-1
07:58:52.951 --> 07:58:56.986
<v Ricky Horton>We go to this next pile of steel and
working on this job.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2545-2
07:58:56.986 --> 07:59:00.604
<v Ricky Horton>So that side of it is great.
They have a swamp job,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2545-3
07:59:00.604 --> 07:59:05.613
<v Ricky Horton>so because there you got stopped,
then you got to do another record and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2545-4
07:59:05.613 --> 07:59:07.700
<v Ricky Horton>start it right there to do it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2546-0
07:59:07.900 --> 07:59:11.195
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
they ought to be just like a swap job,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2546-1
07:59:11.195 --> 07:59:14.624
<v Ricky Horton>change job or whatever.
But they have that, right?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2546-2
07:59:14.624 --> 07:59:20.204
<v Ricky Horton>There's a lot of them that when you stop,
when you go into the next one, it stops.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2546-3
07:59:20.204 --> 07:59:23.700
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, this one does.
It's a that's why I say.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2547-0
07:59:23.860 --> 07:59:27.941
<v Ricky Horton>When clients ask me about this,
I'll say it's a little clunky. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2547-1
07:59:27.941 --> 07:59:32.199
<v Ricky Horton>it it could be refined. In fact,
I'm seriously thinking about rewriting</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2547-2
07:59:32.199 --> 07:59:35.451
<v Ricky Horton>the interface,
having my son rewrite the interface for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2547-3
07:59:35.451 --> 07:59:40.182
<v Ricky Horton>him. What was the best one you've seen?
I don't get into a lot of people's time</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2547-4
07:59:40.182 --> 07:59:41.660
<v Ricky Horton>talks what they're using.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2548-0
07:59:42.100 --> 07:59:47.378
<v Ricky Horton>What I used to use is called time off
plus and it worked pretty well.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2548-1
07:59:47.378 --> 07:59:53.560
<v Ricky Horton>I just couldn't go very deep on my level
so I could I could do job and see what's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2548-2
07:59:53.560 --> 07:59:56.500
<v Ricky Horton>as low as I could go if I wanted to so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2549-0
07:59:57.100 --> 08:00:00.763
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm going.
I have some good input on what's the best</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2549-1
08:00:00.763 --> 08:00:04.491
<v Ricky Horton>thing out there.
I didn't know our ours changed to where</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2549-2
08:00:04.491 --> 08:00:09.724
<v Ricky Horton>it used to be you'd walk up, you know,
whatever we did last and come right back</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2549-3
08:00:09.724 --> 08:00:12.340
<v Ricky Horton>up. Yeah, and the new system you had to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2550-0
08:00:12.380 --> 08:00:17.196
<v Ricky Horton>Do it every time.
It was just ridiculous because you might</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2550-1
08:00:17.196 --> 08:00:22.256
<v Ricky Horton>be sometimes on jobs for weeks. Yeah,
but yeah, I don't know.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2550-2
08:00:22.256 --> 08:00:28.540
<v Ricky Horton>And then I didn't think about having to
do at the interface to the business.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2551-0
08:00:29.180 --> 08:00:33.060
<v Ricky Horton>If I was like they were going to do it,
you know?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2552-0
08:00:34.540 --> 08:00:39.205
<v Ricky Horton>But what? What ends up dumping the Vista?
How much detail?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2552-1
08:00:39.205 --> 08:00:45.610
<v Ricky Horton>All the detail or or what jumps the Vista
automatically or that you have to like</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2552-2
08:00:45.610 --> 08:00:51.460
<v Ricky Horton>automatically the the integration here
does PHP over seats and that's it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2553-0
08:00:51.740 --> 08:00:56.427
<v Ricky Horton>But they are doing what the next form out
of you manipulate.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2553-1
08:00:56.427 --> 08:01:01.727
<v Ricky Horton>We have to get in the right form after
this and they get this right.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2553-2
08:01:01.727 --> 08:01:08.180
<v Ricky Horton>So much time does that say at this point
it takes me 10 minutes, 12 minutes a week.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2554-0
08:01:08.540 --> 08:01:12.817
<v Ricky Horton>So in the beginning we've paid the guy
the whole time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2554-1
08:01:12.817 --> 08:01:18.415
<v Ricky Horton>Now it's starting to it's a side task for
somebody else to be planning.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2554-2
08:01:18.415 --> 08:01:22.380
<v Ricky Horton>They're ready to do it.
So not not too cumbersome.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2555-0
08:01:25.940 --> 08:01:31.204
<v Ricky Horton>No, but yeah,
that's that's pretty much our process.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2555-1
08:01:31.204 --> 08:01:34.580
<v Ricky Horton>Um process sold for the most part.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2556-0
08:01:35.660 --> 08:01:39.763
<v Ricky Horton>And then, yeah,
it would be very useful to have more</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2556-1
08:01:39.763 --> 08:01:44.174
<v Ricky Horton>members in this,
understand this and then switch it on a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2556-2
08:01:44.174 --> 08:01:50.289
<v Ricky Horton>cloning machine so I could have like two
or three of me and then I'll be safe.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2556-3
08:01:50.289 --> 08:01:51.140
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2557-0
08:01:51.940 --> 08:01:57.656
<v Ricky Horton>But you know,
in all circuits and time studies,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2557-1
08:01:57.656 --> 08:02:07.300
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I learned this week that that's
my job. So depending on the studies and.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2558-0
08:02:17.260 --> 08:02:22.876
<v Ricky Horton>Data in the system and say this is the
last chance.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2558-1
08:02:22.876 --> 08:02:31.840
<v Ricky Horton>We hired a guy just to do what's called
CI and he was responsible for all of that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2558-2
08:02:31.840 --> 08:02:32.380
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2559-0
08:02:32.380 --> 08:02:37.214
<v Ricky Horton>We haven't got it for a while.
We really did some time studies and stuff</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2559-1
08:02:37.214 --> 08:02:41.915
<v Ricky Horton>and we changed some hours around,
but like it was when we changed some</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2559-2
08:02:41.915 --> 08:02:45.359
<v Ricky Horton>hours around,
we wouldn't push it against the other</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2559-3
08:02:45.359 --> 08:02:50.524
<v Ricky Horton>side and change it for that size. Yeah,
you know they have to cut a C8 by 11.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2559-4
08:02:50.524 --> 08:02:51.980
<v Ricky Horton>5 crazy in this thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2560-0
08:02:52.220 --> 08:02:59.965
<v Ricky Horton>And that's it.
So it's never pushed into a range of size.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2560-1
08:02:59.965 --> 08:03:10.780
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's something that would be
huge. So yeah, that would be brilliant.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2561-0
08:03:11.420 --> 08:03:15.180
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I've been looking in there just with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2561-1
08:03:15.180 --> 08:03:19.727
<v Ricky Horton>scheduling.
I think it should be breaking more into</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2561-2
08:03:19.727 --> 08:03:26.721
<v Ricky Horton>the normal X. Yeah, I get it. I get it.
Nice part is the shop starts performing</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2561-3
08:03:26.721 --> 08:03:31.180
<v Ricky Horton>or anything because I start time at 7:00
AM. So I.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2562-0
08:03:31.340 --> 08:03:45.068
<v Ricky Horton>I'll reach it all week. I haven't.
So we sometimes that's what she had to do.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2562-1
08:03:45.068 --> 08:03:48.060
<v Ricky Horton>Consolation goes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2563-0
08:03:48.060 --> 08:03:55.287
<v Ricky Horton>I felt like we were picking on you there
for a while. Oh, none of you.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2563-1
08:03:55.287 --> 08:03:59.460
<v Ricky Horton>It's you guys are having great questions.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2564-0
08:04:03.820 --> 08:04:07.632
<v Ricky Horton>So like it's to me,
that's one of the biggest issues with</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2564-1
08:04:07.632 --> 08:04:11.509
<v Ricky Horton>this system issues.
People don't see it as a communication</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2564-2
08:04:11.509 --> 08:04:14.663
<v Ricky Horton>problem.
They'll see it as you put the data and</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2564-3
08:04:14.663 --> 08:04:19.460
<v Ricky Horton>you know what happened so I can call you
and figure out what's happened.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2565-0
08:04:19.580 --> 08:04:28.206
<v Ricky Horton>And that shipped me well.
I think it's like that ain't the brand</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2565-1
08:04:28.206 --> 08:04:36.964
<v Ricky Horton>supposed to be working.
We're doing the work in the background so</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2565-2
08:04:36.964 --> 08:04:39.220
<v Ricky Horton>that you have to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2566-0
08:04:39.540 --> 08:04:44.619
<v Ricky Horton>No, exactly.
I had one of the best friends in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2566-1
08:04:44.619 --> 08:04:50.801
<v Ricky Horton>marketing Sunday.
He did the production and if he were,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2566-2
08:04:50.801 --> 08:04:58.860
<v Ricky Horton>he would get bugged all the time by the
project manager. Did this Jerry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2567-0
08:04:58.940 --> 08:05:02.952
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, what about this big spot?
And I told you, I said,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2567-1
08:05:02.952 --> 08:05:07.538
<v Ricky Horton>if I hear you tell, they'll have,
if you give them information,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2567-2
08:05:07.538 --> 08:05:11.048
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to kill you. I'm like,
when they call,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2567-3
08:05:11.048 --> 08:05:15.060
<v Ricky Horton>you show up one time to do it and you
upload next time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2568-0
08:05:15.260 --> 08:05:22.323
<v Ricky Horton>I mean that we're already believe in that.
You know, I think, I mean, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2568-1
08:05:22.323 --> 08:05:28.062
<v Ricky Horton>why do so many kids stop?
I've never heard of only things I have</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2568-2
08:05:28.062 --> 08:05:34.860
<v Ricky Horton>generally different things. Exactly.
You should be able to do this. Exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2569-0
08:05:34.860 --> 08:05:46.920
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not interested.
I'm interested to find something that's a</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2569-1
08:05:46.920 --> 08:05:54.700
<v Ricky Horton>great interpretation, especially in the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2570-0
08:05:54.780 --> 08:06:12.300
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there's a problem. Yeah, it's so I,
you know, it's like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2571-0
08:06:14.740 --> 08:06:20.319
<v Ricky Horton>It's as long as plenty of it.
So I it's fact that that's it's. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2571-1
08:06:20.319 --> 08:06:26.221
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because he says 88%, I'm assuming 88%. So,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2571-2
08:06:26.221 --> 08:06:30.101
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, I don't know.
I'll answer some questions.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2571-3
08:06:30.101 --> 08:06:33.820
<v Ricky Horton>Do I even get a watch?
That's really on here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2572-0
08:06:34.060 --> 08:06:40.226
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it was.
So we definitely got some different</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2572-1
08:06:40.226 --> 08:06:47.994
<v Ricky Horton>concepts to work on.
It's so much easier for the board to work</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2572-2
08:06:47.994 --> 08:06:50.460
<v Ricky Horton>on. It's like, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2573-0
08:06:50.540 --> 08:07:04.961
<v Ricky Horton>Programming versus running these packages.
There's so many little back dates to take</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2573-1
08:07:04.961 --> 08:07:10.220
<v Ricky Horton>time to set up to the level of.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2574-0
08:07:10.260 --> 08:07:13.912
<v Ricky Horton>It's not hard for the working,
so it's like that. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2574-1
08:07:13.912 --> 08:07:17.439
<v Ricky Horton>it's just that that was a little certain
level of time.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2574-2
08:07:17.439 --> 08:07:22.476
<v Ricky Horton>It's a really inefficient on this level,
but in the same, it really is. I mean,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2574-3
08:07:22.476 --> 08:07:26.632
<v Ricky Horton>especially if you change factor and the
environment on top of it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2574-4
08:07:26.632 --> 08:07:29.780
<v Ricky Horton>it's not really good,
but we know that like this.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2577-0
08:07:31.100 --> 08:07:43.615
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's what I got today. Yeah,
I thought I was on the push.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2577-1
08:07:43.615 --> 08:07:48.780
<v Ricky Horton>We'll be on the same page.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2578-0
08:07:49.540 --> 08:07:54.905
<v Ricky Horton>I have to say the block processes,
you know, you know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2578-1
08:07:54.905 --> 08:08:01.732
<v Ricky Horton>I brought break up some more data.
I might get break toward this guy.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2593-1
08:12:09.522 --> 08:12:17.946
<v Ricky Horton>I've been working at that.
Some of those that are more like they're</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2593-2
08:12:17.946 --> 08:12:22.900
<v Ricky Horton>like reality glasses that are like just.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2594-0

08:12:30.796 --> 08:12:39.660
<v Ricky Horton>be for that, but I mean, it's probably,
it's probably.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2595-0
08:12:40.060 --> 08:12:45.532
<v Ricky Horton>It wasn't. I really haven't got a minute.
I'll switch. I'll study. I was like,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2595-1
08:12:45.532 --> 08:12:49.618
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know where to schedule that.
I do appreciate that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2595-2
08:12:49.618 --> 08:12:54.466
<v Ricky Horton>I'd like to send me about it.
So I went through all that this morning</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2595-3
08:12:54.466 --> 08:12:59.660
<v Ricky Horton>for you to have me start over there and
just slipping back my floor again.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-0
08:12:59.980 --> 08:13:03.439
<v Ricky Horton>So, yeah, you know,
we have about the problems locked in</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-1
08:13:03.439 --> 08:13:06.291
<v Ricky Horton>common.
So I need to start with a new call for</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-2
08:13:06.291 --> 08:13:08.900
<v Ricky Horton>you.
Then I need they go up there and it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-3
08:13:08.900 --> 08:13:11.752
<v Ricky Horton>actually.
So I remember all that this morning.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-4
08:13:11.752 --> 08:13:15.635
<v Ricky Horton>It's your statements that this is a good
job. It might be more.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2596-5
08:13:15.635 --> 08:13:19.700
<v Ricky Horton>It's not good to do before something.
I think, yeah, as a manager.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2597-0
08:13:19.780 --> 08:13:26.065
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but I mean, I think I'll get this.
Yeah. And that's the difference on it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2597-1
08:13:26.065 --> 08:13:29.835
<v Ricky Horton>All of this, all of this,
we need to put it on.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2597-2
08:13:29.835 --> 08:13:36.277
<v Ricky Horton>It's like you can privacy see what you do.
Yeah. And very nice. Yeah. Well, I'll.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2597-3
08:13:36.277 --> 08:13:39.340
<v Ricky Horton>You guys have a good easy pay them off.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2598-0
08:13:39.780 --> 08:13:45.047
<v Ricky Horton>It was for the shop.
I have an authorization for over to buy</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2598-1
08:13:45.047 --> 08:13:50.660
<v Ricky Horton>all of these because and at the time that
station wasn't around,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2598-2
08:13:50.660 --> 08:13:55.236
<v Ricky Horton>but Trimble Connect was they were messing
with that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2598-3
08:13:55.236 --> 08:13:59.380
<v Ricky Horton>So I was going to buy them while I was
waiting.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2599-0
08:13:59.460 --> 08:14:02.992
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the second generation of all of this is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2599-1
08:14:02.992 --> 08:14:07.905
<v Ricky Horton>coming out because the first generation
was plus one. You know,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2599-2
08:14:07.905 --> 08:14:14.123
<v Ricky Horton>it wasn't like the second generation was
willing and I've left before the second</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2599-3
08:14:14.123 --> 08:14:17.500
<v Ricky Horton>generation.
I think it just played with it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2600-0
08:14:17.860 --> 08:14:24.183
<v Ricky Horton>Seems really good. It's it's awesome,
especially like it's simply yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2600-1
08:14:24.183 --> 08:14:29.890
<v Ricky Horton>to see where every specific numbers could
be. Yeah, or it's not.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2600-2
08:14:29.890 --> 08:14:32.700
<v Ricky Horton>I will put that in station, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2601-0
08:14:35.100 --> 08:14:40.287
<v Ricky Horton>And that's just, I mean,
it's essentially the same thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2601-1
08:14:40.287 --> 08:14:46.904
<v Ricky Horton>It's just it has to break here. Yeah,
that's way more. Yeah, Ted. So Ted,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2601-2
08:14:46.904 --> 08:14:52.180
<v Ricky Horton>I'll I'll start at the end of that Tekla,
one of the guys.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2602-0
08:14:52.700 --> 08:14:58.216
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I think of some guys I listened to.
They want to talk to people that are</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2602-1
08:14:58.216 --> 08:15:01.869
<v Ricky Horton>using to see what they like,
what they don't like.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2602-2
08:15:01.869 --> 08:15:05.880
<v Ricky Horton>If they can improve on something,
what they improve on,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2602-3
08:15:05.880 --> 08:15:11.180
<v Ricky Horton>which kind of tells them we might be
trying to do that to improve and so.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2603-0
08:15:11.540 --> 08:15:17.740
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so I'm, I'm, you know, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2604-0
08:15:19.220 --> 08:15:22.823
<v Ricky Horton>Which I'm kind of surprised if you look
at doing that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2604-1
08:15:22.823 --> 08:15:26.557
<v Ricky Horton>If they got partners in that is like
already doing that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2604-2
08:15:26.557 --> 08:15:31.469
<v Ricky Horton>I think they were trying to integrate
with that with with the power level,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2604-3
08:15:31.469 --> 08:15:34.220
<v Ricky Horton>one fire station trying to integrate with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2607-0
08:15:44.420 --> 08:15:48.496
<v Ricky Horton>But the glasses, I mean, I will. I mean,
I need glasses.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2607-1
08:15:48.496 --> 08:15:54.003
<v Ricky Horton>So there's more prescription. Yep,
man vessels. Yep. Yep. And then they, uh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2607-2
08:15:54.003 --> 08:15:58.293
<v Ricky Horton>their prescription.
And then there the transition length is</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2607-3
08:15:58.293 --> 08:16:02.584

mine is the battery life and it's it's</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2607-4

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2608-2
08:16:11.103 --> 08:16:14.003
<v Ricky Horton>if they can't shove more batteries in
there, yeah. Oh,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2608-3
08:16:14.003 --> 08:16:18.010
<v Ricky Horton>how have you already figured out how to
attach them to their battery? Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2608-4
08:16:18.010 --> 08:16:19.380
<v Ricky Horton>a little small manual. Um.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2609-0
08:16:19.460 --> 08:16:23.988
<v Ricky Horton>There's one that they do have to where a
guy can like have a battery pack and it</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2609-1
08:16:23.988 --> 08:16:27.229
<v Ricky Horton>still needs to run a wire, you know?
And it's like, yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2609-2
08:16:27.229 --> 08:16:31.254
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't thought of anything that just
clips on, you know what I mean?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2609-3
08:16:31.254 --> 08:16:34.551
<v Ricky Horton>You know what? Surely. OK,
so that's the smart game. Yeah,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2609-4
08:16:34.551 --> 08:16:36.060
<v Ricky Horton>that that's smart could be.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2610-0
08:16:36.420 --> 08:16:40.073
<v Ricky Horton>And and it's constantly lit up like it's
obviously.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2610-1
08:16:40.073 --> 08:16:45.412
<v Ricky Horton>And so it's constantly lit up and this
thing will last all about two weeks,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2610-2
08:16:45.412 --> 08:16:49.347
<v Ricky Horton>which kills me.
But of course it's not going to obviate</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2610-3
08:16:49.347 --> 08:16:53.070
<v Ricky Horton>and all that, that's a lot of my kids,
but I'm just,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2610-4
08:16:53.070 --> 08:16:56.020
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just sitting here thinking this thing.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2611-0
08:16:57.180 --> 08:17:02.127
<v Ricky Horton>How does it get two weeks out of that?
Where's the battery even at? Exactly.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2611-1
08:17:02.127 --> 08:17:05.917
<v Ricky Horton>You know how is? I mean,
it still has to take all of that,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2611-2
08:17:05.917 --> 08:17:09.001
<v Ricky Horton>like you can send it to your phone or
whatever.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2611-3
08:17:09.001 --> 08:17:12.020
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm assuming it's just right there in
that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2612-0
08:17:12.100 --> 08:17:17.300
<v Ricky Horton>So, but I think very much.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2613-0
08:17:17.340 --> 08:17:17.780
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2615-0
08:17:19.180 --> 08:17:28.780
<v Ricky Horton>In the gas station trying to get or they
have talked about on integrating with.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2619-0
08:17:55.500 --> 08:17:56.180
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2620-0
08:17:57.420 --> 08:18:05.700
<v Ricky Horton>I would like to.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2621-0
08:18:10.060 --> 08:18:18.423
<v Ricky Horton>This was served for. I just want to talk.
I've played with one of the material was</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2621-1
08:18:18.423 --> 08:18:26.180
<v Ricky Horton>first messed and there's a valley that we
were shot for a while as a salted.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2622-0
08:18:26.340 --> 08:18:34.320
<v Ricky Horton>But he had wine.
We brought up certain bottles on it,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2622-1
08:18:34.320 --> 08:18:36.980
<v Ricky Horton>but it was pretty.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2624-0
08:18:53.500 --> 08:18:53.860
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2628-0
08:19:13.780 --> 08:19:13.940
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2629-0
08:19:15.380 --> 08:19:17.220
<v Ricky Horton>It was.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2630-0
08:19:18.580 --> 08:19:26.180
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still on Microsoft with producing.
Yeah, that's pretty good, actually, it is.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2633-0
08:19:41.500 --> 08:19:41.620
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2635-0
08:19:55.820 --> 08:19:55.980
<v Ricky Horton>True.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2636-0
08:19:57.540 --> 08:20:09.860
<v Ricky Horton>And how's my glasses would probably be
pretty close to your glasses, but.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2637-0
08:20:12.340 --> 08:20:19.347
<v Ricky Horton>Should be on the home screen and then you
can sure to touch and and then if you go</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2637-1
08:20:19.347 --> 08:20:23.484
<v Ricky Horton>to the apps you can you can see the fab
station.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2637-2
08:20:23.484 --> 08:20:28.380
<v Ricky Horton>If you open up fab station in there it'll
go through the.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2638-0
08:20:28.700 --> 08:20:31.380
<v Ricky Horton>The opening, all apps, yeah.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2639-0
08:20:34.700 --> 08:20:42.562
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's such an idea.
I don't want to ask.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2639-1
08:20:42.562 --> 08:20:47.860
<v Ricky Horton>And then I want a conversation.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2640-0
08:20:52.220 --> 08:20:59.012
<v Ricky Horton>How easy is it to get the piece out of
the model to lay out? Or is that it's?</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2640-1
08:20:59.012 --> 08:21:05.368
<v Ricky Horton>It takes a little bit of getting used to,
but now they've made it a lot,</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2640-2
08:21:05.368 --> 08:21:06.500
<v Ricky Horton>a lot easier.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2641-0
08:21:11.180 --> 08:21:17.020
<v Ricky Horton>It's like device registration,
auto fab connection, retry.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2642-0
08:21:18.220 --> 08:21:23.340
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna log in with that station app
using the tablets like that.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2643-0
08:21:25.140 --> 08:21:31.300
<v Ricky Horton>Someone would work here.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2644-0
08:21:34.100 --> 08:21:34.260
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2645-0
08:21:37.180 --> 08:21:41.530
<v Ricky Horton>This is.
I just can't believe Tremel gave up on</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2645-1
08:21:41.530 --> 08:21:45.789
<v Ricky Horton>this.
Tremel was going down this road and just</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2645-2
08:21:45.789 --> 08:21:51.860
<v Ricky Horton>gave up on it. I was like, come on,
as you were right there at it.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2647-0
08:22:02.220 --> 08:22:02.980
<v Ricky Horton>That's OK.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2659-0
08:23:05.420 --> 08:23:11.178
<v Ricky Horton>That's a moment.
I'll I'll get this charge.</v>

51ba12f7-1d64-456c-a404-13807242dd02/2659-1
08:23:11.178 --> 08:23:20.860
<v Ricky Horton>I'll introduce you to Dave Lopez of
technical. He wants to talk about it.</v>
