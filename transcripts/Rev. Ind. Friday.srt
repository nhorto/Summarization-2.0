1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,393
The report that I was given, that I did was,

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:06,910
I filtered for that, just the place again,

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:09,281
and then I filtered for guests.

4
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:11,634
It was that plate size, which was the 8th inch,

5
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,405
and then when I created the report, what we do is we put them

6
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:17,280
in our, like, job orders. So instead of,

7
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,110
instead of putting it in the job order for that other job number,

8
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:23,104
I put it in the job for this one that I want to release.

9
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:28,036
So, it'll have all the of that information on there.

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,091
And it's funny because, like, as soon as that message popped up,

11
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:40,490
I called him and I was like, I don't want it included on this

12
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,557
cutter because I want it to make my own cutter,

13
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:44,986
but now knowing I can't make a cutter until it's cut,

14
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:48,976
well, I'm not going to go back in after I've released this job to

15
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:52,457
try and cut and make a cutter, because I can't release the job until

16
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:58,705
Problem is,

17
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:06,442
it's all backdrop Well,

18
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:11,282
there were some topics where I could literally do my homework without that argument.

19
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,351
What I think that is.

20
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,080
Thank you much for bringing it up. You'll be able Thank you.

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,331
Who's thinking of you somewhere?

22
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,350
And you would think,

23
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:29,305
like, at least let me create the cutter.

24
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:34,109
And redline

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,599
it And make this cutter not active until you're done with this thing.

26
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,367
You need something

27
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:51,793
Well, it realistically should have the PO in the job that it's pulling

28
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:54,026
it from anyways, and then eventually, the key number.

29
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,948
So, like, it has all the information to pull it in from.

30
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,356
Like, it's the simple fact that you,

31
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:03,558
can't create it until it's cut.

32
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,957
That's where I draw, like, uhm,

33
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,081
it just doesn't I mean,

34
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:12,598
I don't know if it exists at all,

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,311
it doesn't exist here, but if at all,

36
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:20,855
I don't know where it is. But if it'll allow me to put those

37
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:25,351
parts on that plate before it's cut,

38
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:28,230
you know it's gonna have a REM for it,

39
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,194
so, like, what? You know?

40
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,136
That's their problem. That's their problem. It's not their issue.

41
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,587
Don't think I would want their issue. Blimey, they've got it there.

42
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,779
This is not with pointless action.

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,463
We've got to do it. Well, what if the opposite You're going to the

44
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,886
only one who's going to start breaking all this respect. I know.

45
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,411
We're going to have a problem. But, in terms of,

46
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,462
All these sites have been elucidated.

47
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,140
What do you want me to do?

48
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,398
Start a family, but... Alright,

49
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:01,395
Follow back. Yeah,

50
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:06,230
I just gotta go reprogram it so that I just throw it all I

51
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:10,902
need some, uh, some water. I'm keep my Please

52
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,416
tell me some of the other giants. All of us.

53
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,771
I was looking at all the stuff that, uh, so I'm going to,

54
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,540
because I didn't have sales for it, to the estimate folder.

55
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:26,571
Yeah. And I just started going backwards in time to see what was in

56
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,436
the estimate folder. Yeah. It was really embarrassing.

57
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm only looking at the folder,

58
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,180
that's the second one. I wasn't looking at all the ones that we were,

59
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:38,877
and did, so, That's the only one.

60
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,084
Very good. Because I recognize those drawings.

61
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,319
Yeah, Scratch my head,

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,980
but I assume they're kind of gearing up the reason they

63
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,436
want to hire people like you, me, and this other group.

64
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:56,384
God, if it's doing the uhm,

65
00:03:56,395 --> 00:04:00,068
scheduling, they must be ramping up to do a lot of little big stuff.

66
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,143
That's the message. I think,

67
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,423
if you are, they will come chanepin.

68
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,044
I don't think they're at that stage yet,

69
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:11,163
cause like I said, they're gonna- I'm gonna go like 10 to the quarter,

70
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,364
get out of enough to give the person Jira a plan for how I

71
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,436
was gonna tackle it, the match. That's what I'm Yeah.

72
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,793
I want to push some easy shit here,

73
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:23,203
right? I want to talk to a guy about N20 saws there,

74
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,500
and we'll just- . . . It doesn't even- .

75
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,661
. You know, he's doing everything on any of the tape measure.

76
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,949
That saw it, or cake,

77
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,249
because we haven't- . . I gotta- Yeah,

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,281
so I figure- He knows what it's like.

79
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,309
You can upload the standoff as a case.

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,916
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, it was the proper LED.

81
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,511
So, he can- There are more in the machines,

82
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,626
too, right? So I don't want to make one of those.

83
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,746
And I'm supposedly uploading this. I'm like,

84
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:50,919
actually, yeah, but it's all bad. Alright, get all the things that are going

85
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,188
to happen now. Yeah. With the machine,

86
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,856
it has to be good. Absolutely. It's good to go.

87
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:59,526
We had that exact same song. So, Yeah, we got the AC-DC out there

88
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,828
coming on. Assuming these guys program,

89
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:05,556
you know, they want to do something to see.

90
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,286
I mean, for this facility in M20,

91
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,901
it's a small saw. Yeah. We were using M40 of us,

92
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:15,254
and we were instructional. First of all, we're reviewing it to have all kinds

93
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,835
of stuff, but I really don't think they do.

94
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:20,767
That's a big stretch over here. I think it's fun.

95
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,840
It's fun. That's what it appears to be.

96
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,271
Oh, I think I'll be glad to give you some seminal questions.

97
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,485
I'm not sure, but that's one of the things. Thanks.

98
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,310
<v Ricky Horton>What is your report?

99
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,761
You're going to do it before you fly, interesting.

100
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,331
Ah, it'll probably be something next week, so we're going to do that.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,290
begin So, what happens is on there playing right back on people

102
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,930
always. Cause I know my voice wants to deal here, Jeff wants to deal

103
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,191
with me. I'll see you rather than come from you,

104
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,165
and I said, hey, let's have the,

105
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,330
uh, cuz Chris put one out already, and I told him.

106
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,431
Tom? Tom? I you, but Chris already put one out.

107
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:57,789
No, no, no, no, saying it. Yeah, I know we'll be getting plenty of

108
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,656
requests if we have a good amount of history game here,

109
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,567
so I'll tell you a I hear

110
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:07,631
the room is about following it. I leave it in a second. I don't

111
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,876
hear it. It's good. I'm coming. Very good.

112
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:14,232
. . Hang on. Hey, I was planning to show up yesterday morning for

113
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,489
a cave. I here, I was talking to a couple people,

114
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,108
and I mean And go on look. This guy mics.

115
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,535
Yeah, he's making a program.

116
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:25,764
He doesn't say anything. It's great. Well,

117
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,003
yeah. . I mean, he's like, yeah.

118
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,898
You've been here all week. Yeah, you're here for the most support for him.

119
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,207
Yeah. I feel like he's the other friend that's been doing.

120
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,958
Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,053
He's pretty much right. Yeah. So you have this guy in front of you.

122
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,357
I think you'll just say, hey, can this do that?

123
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,651
That's what we're looking for. There Ready? And, uh,

124
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:49,090
uh, yeah. Thanks, Mavana. I would really like to see some bit again.

125
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:52,267
It's just right now. . I think we've got to consolidate,

126
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:55,050
get it to start all engines and tech on the lead.

127
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:57,482
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,725
Just a Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,115
Yeah. You just want some water out of it. Ah,

130
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:06,151
there's 33 broken.

131
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:09,195
Instead of walking, we'll walk or to see that as well.

132
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,507
You can't. We'll run down. We'll just,

133
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,617
we'll get to the end of the video. . . . I don't think

134
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:17,176
it's 33, because I've been trying to ride it down, but I think it's

135
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,384
10. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

136
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,236
that's what we're tasting. Yeah. I think we're about to.

137
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:26,363
Yeah. I keep here and I'm good at the tech over there.

138
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,626
I think they're communicating, using tech. And that's a nice one.

139
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,886
I think that- I don't know if these others- I don't know if they're

140
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:35,065
in the shop exactly to you yet, or what they're using.

141
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:38,311
Yeah. I don't know if they're using tech or something like that.

142
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:40,816
Yeah, and I think that, uhm,

143
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,477
it's the really good thing with me is that it shouldn't come to me.

144
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,356
With Travis, Eric, and for anybody who needs to be- Good.

145
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:48,409
Yeah, quick. To Jessica,

146
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,224
I think we're going to get two other people here, okay?

147
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,740
Thank you. Listen to the shot,

148
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,795
baby. I would have to go find a baby for a lot of money

149
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,992
in the guy that I know about. Three bucks when you're doing this,

150
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,183
yeah? There's a guy who wants to do the shoot. Yeah.

151
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:03,913
Yeah. Thank you. Bye. Thank you much. He's over there.

152
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:08,797
Exactly the same. He goes to everything in and

153
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:11,351
out of here. You And I used to,

154
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,680
you said, well, I was there. Okay, show me how to do this.

155
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:16,479
Uh, what? You need to come back.

156
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,516
Take that, but I like this. Yes. Yes. Yes,

157
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:22,024
I like this. It's like that. It's hard enough,

158
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,210
so I'm not gonna work with the other two, but there's a name.

159
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,556
Okay, so was a We'll a second.

160
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:28,789
First new land, and everybody knows it's one of these.

161
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,561
I don't know if I'll do it again, it's out of line.

162
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,351
I don't wanna release some of this. I don't wanna do it again.

163
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:38,421
Good bye. I know they're not in Bitbucket, but that is in Bitbucket.

164
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:41,228
But that's what I did to if Bitbucket was in before,

165
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,865
because, the base setup needs to be done,

166
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:47,594
and the city needs to be made with this,

167
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,564
you know, tablet, what they came with, with all those things on your phone,

168
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:53,138
sure. I think it just changed the key.

169
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,356
That's what Chris wants, too. And what?

170
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:58,776
But when I ask you that if you don't like the campaign.

171
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,991
Small front jeans and sits there, can you try and play?

172
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,262
Yeah. I go with you, and take a look.

173
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,597
No, you should be better at you if you really want to hang out.

174
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,670
You should be to visit the latest. and one, right? Oh,

175
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,241
okay. Yeah, go ahead. I guess so.

176
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,391
So, how do you manage this? So, just stretch with everything.

177
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:16,757
Thank very much. I'm going be great for you right now. Yeah, I understand.

178
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,520
Yeah, I like that. So, it kills me.

179
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,886
And then, well, whenever I get into exploration,

180
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:25,383
I'm going to be. Oh, yeah. And I love some of the cheap stuff.

181
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:28,017
I do too. And I like the other, because they're,

182
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,620
they're the worst and you're at it on a company.

183
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,966
Love you guys. I see you. You they're the worst.

184
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,456
You know, they have no certain business. I'll do what you know in a

185
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,911
few minutes. Yeah, I have to.

186
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,126
The other city, the island, I'm tired of repair. Yeah. Meekin' it.

187
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,306
Meekin' it. Meekin' it.

188
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,556
Meekin' it. Meekin' it. Meekin' Meekin' it. Meekin' Meekin' it. Please sister,

189
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:50,475
let me hear it. It was really good and attractive labor.

190
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:54,985
It was really good for me because I've seen this for 20 years.

191
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:58,557
But I think that

192
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,307
this really constrains systems.

193
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:09,199
It takes out all of the power that the estimators have had.

194
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,076
Yeah. I'll see you and move them to the designers.

195
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,243
Mm-hmm. It's not all of a designer, they don't know the business.

196
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,960
They're just making drives, but until the design- So.

197
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:21,819
Mm-hmm. Nothing else could get done.

198
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,107
Yeah. Because the material couldn't get built.

199
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:27,770
Yeah. All that stuff would procure my guide to- Today,

200
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:32,632
EDS has to wait for designing a push to consolidate it.

201
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:37,618
Yes. And- We went from job buying for jobs

202
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:42,737
to buying the inventory. So let's say four jobs come up.

203
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:47,645
Yeah. You know, purchasing guy consolidates it all in

204
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,803
order to whatever. Yeah.

205
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:52,554
You have no idea. A Yeah, inventory,

206
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:55,205
hold up, hold up, hold over to review.

207
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:58,291
Boom. You just don't grab that,

208
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:03,192
whatever you want. Yeah. But I think it's a shit show for job

209
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,508
shops. Yeah, it'll be like, we're just seeing it,

210
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,932
we're just seeing it in the environment. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

211
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,225
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's take a look at what we're going to do

212
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,365
in this room.

213
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,601
Umm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

214
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:23,431
yeah. He's going to

215
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,537
I'm going to do no time, not scratch. Oh,

216
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:30,193
you should grab it. Umm. But they're going to set up,

217
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,790
from here on, . Oh, okay,

218
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,168
that's the point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, since we did.

219
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,511
Yeah. Yeah, since we didn't want to make them able to have the,

220
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:43,685
They're trying to meet all the desires and who's actually buying it.

221
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,786
It's easy to buy. Right, doesn't it?

222
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:49,356
I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You But I think eventually,

223
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,685
I don't know what system that's gonna be. Yeah,

224
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,591
I think what it sounds like, the others. There is.

225
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,635
Don't you think I need to try the smart projects that are going on

226
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,346
in front of me? Yeah, I should appreciate themselves.

227
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,344
I don't want to tell you that. It's going to be good to hear

228
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:08,424
from these guys, and they're very simple. I'm sorry,

229
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,866
but that is not true. No, that's true,

230
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:16,560
man. Thanks. I'm sorry.

231
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,580
and six pieces of paint. And we'll do all right.

232
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,292
Bye. All right.

233
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:23,734
Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. You did that

235
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,328
too, but you are the worst-gated deaf-wealth.

236
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,639
I said everybody's fresh-eats, so here,

237

239
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,271

240
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,609
right? No default. I'm gonna give you a job.

241
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,425
I'm gonna leave it at the same time as you. So I gotta talk.

242
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,697
Yeah, I'm gonna tell them where to sit at. I'm Joe Schnaup.

243
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:53,034
But I'm gonna help all the way through my- I'm gonna feed them.

244
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:56,337
So they send you- I didn't mean flat-bar,

245
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,869
you know, I meant some of the barrels. No, I'm also- Oh,

246
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,019

We'll you next week. So, he kind of does it.

251
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,944
He does a lot of it the smaller, and we're just making it look

252
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:24,036
like this. Got it. And that's gonna make it look more.

253
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,590
. . . . . . . You know, out even so,

254

259
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,288
I've been doing it for a while, and I've personally come back,

260
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,151
so, uh, it will be, uh, a really good entry.

261
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:51,019
That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,897
In my opinion, I've been doing it 15

263
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:59,635
years. Yeah,

264
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:01,426
I've been doing it 15 years. Yeah. In Europe, it's just these ones, these

265
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,463
ones, they're in their reality environment. Just like,

266
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,231
I'm getting shot.

267
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,501
I'm trying to practice this morning yesterday. I'm living there. And because,

268
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:14,361
again, so I was just opening. I love seeing if I could recover or

269
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:17,021
I could get. Well, I'm truly this week.

270
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,916
I haven't done a longer just set myself.

271
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:23,062
No. No. That's not what they need to donate.

272
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,066
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're like faith. One guy.

273
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,467
We're faith. I don't even need that stuff. Yeah. We're not going to get

274
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,689
over here. They should be. We're going to be business best.

275
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,458
Yeah. Okay. What's that?

276
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,681
One, two, three. . . One, two, three. One,

277
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:41,272
two, three. right now,

278
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:43,929
do you need to do the system? Will you first of all,

279
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,659
I'll be in. I'm to drop down to put in your face to chew

280
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,672
your license. Again, we'll, we'll set the power down.

281
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:52,476
There'll be, there'll be, we want to, uh, give it a sip.

282
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,555
And the Symphanie route, bottle it? Yeah, I can,

283
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:58,159
I can, I can. You can't do anything.

284
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,474
You can't just do everything, but you can't do anything,

285
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,141
edit, and add, you know, so just screw up everything.

286
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,774
And then just, you, oh yeah.

287
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,554
I haven't gotten it like, you. I say,

288
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,917
well, I have an ASU,

289
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,122
I need to move here sometimes, and I got to work out, I was

290
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,591
using the program for it. Okay. Alright.

291
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,552
Alright. It's the same, you know, the transmittals,

292
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,157
drawing them, and we're putting it in there.

293
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,487
Um, I did it for Mr. Good probably.

294
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,267
Love you. Yeah, but I never did any of these things,

295
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,733
right? No, I don't think it's doing it in the end,

296
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:32,671
but that's pretty cool, that's cool. We'll video.

297
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,728
Yeah, so I watch everybody and physically do it.

298
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,532
There is so many different types of things.

299
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,620
Yeah, it's gonna appear when it keeps tellin'. This is pretty good.

300
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,978
I tell everybody I've done that, that I'm new to this.

301
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,586
It's like. Thank watching. You got two sizes in this program.

302
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,359
You got the estimated dimensions. Easy baby baby baby.

303
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,781
I'm a little bit of a huge step.

304
00:15:56,782 --> 00:16:00,101
you Yeah, it is. The warning is you're listening to me.

305
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,222
Whereas the rest of the system is not as much.

306
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,318
They're not their set up. They're not. You are as much as them.

307
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,547
It's the thing that, if you have a lot of movement to watch, something

308
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:11,824
like that. So yeah, I'm going to give today with the model and the

309
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:14,891
portrait. but it makes me happy. I haven't done that, but I haven't probably

310
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,928
been here that time. Well,

311
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,407
I actually did that for you. I still want this one,

312
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,776
uh, done. I'm going here, you like,

313
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,464
you can't bring the shop, you know, and so he used,

314
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,756
you know, it was pretty weird, it's all over.

315
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,956
That, that model to be,

316
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,515
It's the best tool, but it's the best thing we got,

317
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:34,528
yeah, to get it on the first screen.

318
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,380
Appoint key, it's not even all of that. You But,

319
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,736
you know, to see what's happening with that, I'll get it going.

320
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,493
It has a pretty little bit to see. I'll get it going,

321
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:44,641
right? Then I'll see one meeting with Ray.

322
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,963
I'm sorry. Yeah. So they get out of New York,

323
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,999
then we file a little bit. And I,

324
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,195
I like it, but it was super model.

325
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,579
But I did a bit. The, the, the, the uh,

326
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,830
the other thing on that one is, yeah. Eh? Eh?

327
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,671
I know you can go with,

328
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,166
eh, if I'm not singing with me. you. Alright, so the next one could

329
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,912
find this, and you would like to do the drives,

330
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:07,045
yeah, pull the drives into the shot, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,444
I thought that was a good noise. you know,

332
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,021
that's cool, that's cool. That's amazing.

333
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,178
That's cool. That one,

334
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,226
uhm, bigger. you Well,

335
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:22,400
yeah, you feel like you've learned enough about another company to sit here on

336
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,472
and forth. Uhm, yeah, it's listening.

337
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,177
Oh, yeah. I agree a lot.

338
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,581
I didn't mean I couldn't have just been very bad about it. Sure.

339
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,548
Yeah, much so. I'm going go ahead and have a good time.

340
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,317
What do you think? Uh,

341
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,471
uhm, ehm, ehm, ehm, uhm,

342
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:44,419
All right. I'm excited for the third year of your three-champ

343
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,386
to go out and to chime in the spot like to see if you

344
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:52,690
guys can manage it. Yeah. Okay.

345
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:57,204
Let's do it. We are in now. So we'll get some of

346
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:00,366
shots. Sometime sometimes we have come back to consider that.

347
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:03,064
Yeah. Most of them. I may know.

348
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,436
Today we have one demo. Come on, come come on.

349
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:08,112
Go and tell them to be back. We can do that.

350
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,663
We'll just gotta get it. Are you having the demo?

351
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,929
And you'll know this, uh, show you. You remember?

352
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,251
Umm, yes, they were talking, you know, we went through the weekend,

353
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,399
and I was tired of it, and umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm,

354
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,511
umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm,

355
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:24,144
fortnightly tablet so, umm,

356
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:27,621
I-I think that was pretty well,

357
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:32,067
umm, uhm, procedure not necessary. But it had something that you wanted to look

358
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,589
for, set up in here,

359
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,591
and then we can go through a couple of the assemblies in there.

360
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:40,768
And then mark them as complete, and we can go through that process,

361
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,690
see if it looks up again, if you'd like. And what we did,

362
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,600
can we go through most of the code, Steph? That's good. Good evening. Mr.

363
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,056
Early in the week, when he was estimated,

364
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:51,997
we'd tail for him in the code as production. So, um,

365
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,979
on the codeings, we have, situations where,

366
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:57,589
depending on the size of the material,

367
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,471
it will go 30 to 3 wheel over there and go take half a

368
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:06,056
buck. . those are different styles right,

369
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,738
so umm. Anyone know here.

370
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:11,430
All right. So finally,

371
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:14,661
we need you to have to go in and try to set the car

372
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:20,360
up and have some food. So that's- I don't know what

373
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,557
type of material, uhm, but is there a, like, a tag, too, so that

374
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,983
the third behavior for everything, and it's gonna say,

375
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:27,276
like, this is to be- you have boss team, you know, this is to

376
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,422
the team, to the team. You can, uh, make it.

377
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:32,749
Thank you. If it's me, I'm looking back into the finish,

378
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:36,001
and I hear some- You don't want to have the crap in,

379
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:40,031
any code for the finish in the system.

380
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:42,404
So, let me put in what comes- So,

381
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,985
there's people really, can't place those pieces.

382
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:47,970
We've got to do that, actually. Do you do something?

383
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:51,513
You could designate it. And what type of,

384
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:54,729
uhh, what type of frame if you want it to be.

385
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,767
It's, it's not changing, it breaks, it's changing,

386
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:00,603
no? you I just, I got a plastic machine out there,

387
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:02,672
anything above 23 inches high,

388
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,866
or what is it, 485? Anything, out. Okay,

389
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:07,854
folks. Sheolkata?K That's out of that, and I can't look for Dutch.

390
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:10,221
I'm going to do that thing with certain lines. Yeah,

391
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:13,122
certain lines that if it's got plays, there's something that's got to be.

392
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:17,088
See you. So, next time. That's what's going to determine how you're doing it,

393
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,403
is that great, you know, with the light.

394
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,839
Yeah. Just, you know, like, please pick it up.

395
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,764
out. It depends on shape and my question is,

396
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,485
is there a way that we set either a brand new or a filter

397
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,118
in time with wherever it was saying? . If it needs to be removed,

398
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,490
that's that without your anger.

399
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:40,846
Yup. You use this method that it doesn't need to use the other method

400
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,029
of estimating, contract with the light,

401
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,097
and in need and in need and then overlap. I'm going to go over

402
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:49,091
that. And then you can walk along ahead and put that,

403
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:52,261
put that kind of moment to say, hey, at least we'll repeat it right

404
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:56,715
in the community. So, so I- You can move on to this piece 6,

405
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,544
main and this piece of the machine, uh, however you want this,

406
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:03,142
but you can- you can have that right in the- it's an easy feel

407
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:07,237
for all that stuff. So that wouldn't be a problem to all of it.

408
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:09,716
So, we're gonna start on the screen.

409
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:12,455
Ready. Action standards document.

410
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:16,525
Yeah, we'll start with Tony's. I think that case is gonna be,

411
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,670
uh, a massive. Yeah. You know,

412
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:23,061
we're starting with Tony's going to have something to be trying to figure out

413
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:25,175
how we can, we need document control in this,

414
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,995
or in addition to what we're- Yeah.

415
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,069
I thought we didn't show that problem with someone in my hands,

416
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,847
because I haven't been to that, you know, if your life helped,

417
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,812
it was tough. Go. Yeah,

418
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:39,509
he was, he walked me through, the dysphoria is going to go out of

419
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:45,822
the lane. He's talking about the idea to- He's

420
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:48,850
not a doctor. I mean, he didn't doctor control the person if I had

421
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:52,598
one. It does just that. I want someone who's mature and,

422
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,976
too. He's also important.

423
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:59,545
But anyway, it's really good. We want to be- You have started laying this

424
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:03,629
stuff out, and that's what everyone agrees to.

425
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,980
We just put it in there. Yeah. Yeah,

426
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,722
I think. Uh, and so I like to receive,

427
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:12,032
huh, you know I like to receive your phone and the rest of me

428
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,335
in standards. Uh, again, I get you.

429
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:16,505
Good. Not that. Yeah. Sorry.

430
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:19,432
It's, it's something that's lagging.

431
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,814
Yep. Yeah. Right now it's like,

432
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,480
we just- There's no record of anything we got.

433
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:29,235
We're not, we're not of where it was.

434
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:31,886
No time. I I mean, that's not good.

435
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:36,226
Yeah. Start with code instead of simple.

436
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,217
Yeah. Thank you, good word. Well. We'll see the code.

437
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,323
Pretty much out of ops, and great. So, you know,

438
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:43,949
I can't even work. Well, it was good.

439
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:47,998
I told him I was getting my thought. I'm staying there. you Past with

440
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,639
the past, and so he started to work with the

441
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:57,435
internet. should. It'd be nice if you'd go back and look at stuff and

442
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:00,655
see if it was tweaked or what happened.

443
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,916
And that's it.

444
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,646
I think that's a great, uh, piece of data that they kind of need

445
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:08,919
there. Well, watch game digital control over it.

446
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,951
If you're going to change it, it'll be like, I want to know,

447
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,647
What it was, uh, it went to five,

448
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:16,943
and next one later, see ya.

449
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:18,996
So, on the top. Go.

450
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:21,895
Go ahead and do an X4 out the main.

451
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:26,020
And then, just bump it somewhere. All right.

452
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:30,581
Okay. Now, we're so two things you

453
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:32,767
need to do. This is only,

454
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,793
like, a mass of, uh,

455
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:38,952
X4. You can literally import this back into another thing with,

456
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:41,271
I don't know, somewhere. You got the whole set.

457
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:45,382
Yeah. So. I love you. Which is how soon you think about some of

458
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,213
you know, you should understand something that you may have liked,

459
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:50,639
you know. You don't think that there's so many standards,

460
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,160
you know. So, yeah. So, if we created a written standard and

461
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:59,120
then we export once the written standard. We're going to I'm to show you

462
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:03,864
is, is that you can export this out and that could be our market.

463
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,161
Yeah, I'm going to do this. I'll export this out.

464
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,590
No. I might be also create a different,

465
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:13,038
um, shop set up here. So I've got a bubble shop set up.

466
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,313
So we're going which I've got a new shop set up.

467
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:19,771
The shop set up will,

468
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:24,484
um. It will definitely

469
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:26,565
take the time to quickly do it.

470
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:29,319
Now, the, the, the structure of the line can labor very slowly bring.

471
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,214
Thank watching and more than I said,

472
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:35,882
that's the same regardless of which shots I have.

473
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:38,633
But the times would be good. So,

474
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:43,389
we can say. So we can say through a new revised shot

475
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,882
set up and you use that and make all your adjustments here while other

476
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:49,291
than say. . . But you can do that.

477
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:53,237
Just like you were planning on having other shots.

478
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:55,476
Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Okay.

479
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,225
Yeah. Yeah. So there.

480
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:02,679
That's it for the bit of labor,

481
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,728
uh, labor. . . . All of that is,

482
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:09,127
we'll give this whole test off.

483
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,270
So. But you could literally go in here and

484
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,909
make block changes if you knew what you were doing in the code.

485
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,596
Yeah. That's a Is a little bit That easy shot.

486
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:22,348
And people do that. Very rare.

487
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:27,247
Very rare. Uh, but because you have got a blend of structure and

488
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:30,080
all . . Yeah. And then you've got it added.

489
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,551
They saw it. It's easy it's, it's better on people to do that right?

490
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:37,586
So, come on. I know you get pretty good at reading the stuff.

491
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:41,499
Yeah, but there's pretty much sections of this.

492
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:46,084
And so this is a different format. So if you try to point to

493
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,797
it, sale is going to be all over the map.

494
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,751
So you don't know that penalty.

495
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,908
You can start up right there. So,

496
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,469
you're not really okay with sale and further.

497
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:59,796
Thank you. So, who are you guys back up to do it with?

498
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:02,238
Yes, sir. Okay. Okay,

499
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,685
three and over. Now,

500
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:07,132
let's do a week deal. The rocker just keeps it forever.

501
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,852
Alright, I'll just, it's a new file.

502
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:13,690
It's over. I went back five years,

503
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:16,716
couldn't beat it. you Yeah.

504
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:23,399
Come back to the, come back to the party. Uhh,

505
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,723
it's, it's. It's all stored in the, uh,

506
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,384
drive. It'll probably not.

507
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,455
But you gotta be able to pull up the three years,

508
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,375
so like that. So there's probably,

509
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:38,352
I mean, I'm b****** and guesses.

510
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,918
business. But, okay,

511
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,548
it's very, very, very sad. The other thing is,

512
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:47,971
we're not using this full scale, and then,

513
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:50,471
It has time, it's not around, it's just in the, oh,

514
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:52,779
this would be a horrible, and it's not a process.

515
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,007
Now, the other thing is that it's very,

516
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,705
very, very large. Mark. We might have any changes to this

517
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:03,152
week. So there's some dude,

518
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:06,710
bro. He's not a person. He's interested in how,

519
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:10,100
uh, persistence and all over came from him.

520
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:13,866
So back a week. Thank you. Make sure we understand that.

521
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,295
Yeah. And then I'd be curious. I hear things would be better.

522
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:20,616
Yeah. Okay. That's than that. That's okay. I'm just here.

523
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:25,005
These kind of curious how I'm not thinking at all.

524
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,836
Well, it's not that we changed with the Eiffel box.

525
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:31,350
a a step so that we know what we're going to do.

526
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:34,016
Yeah, it's my assumption. As long as we,

527
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:38,290
we can use- use this as our standards,

528
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:42,946
the text file, to be our standards relevant,

529
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,680
and then I'll do- I'm gonna move forward and be attracted out.

530
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,584
So when we pull that, we can- this would be- to give it

531
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,963
a number. Just send it a- . It was a number to Rabe at

532
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,392
the date, and then somewhere nearly mad and,

533
00:27:56,393 --> 00:28:00,036
you know, notes. Mhm.

534
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:01,539
Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.

535
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,740
I know.

536
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:09,647
It's okay. We'll all next week. It's a fun to get up, take a

537
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:13,313
look at the bus. There's some jades, all the jobs that have been called

538
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:17,974
in favor of it. because if you have any of that labor or

539
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:20,689
have any of it, it's almost labor as well as that thing.

540
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,311
So any change that we made this for you is not here.

541
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:26,739
Thank you very much. Thank you. And how do you know the phrase is

542
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,909
there? Like, what if you're in the middle of a job and you want

543
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,071
to take off? And you'll just pick up the new one and go back-

544
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:34,724
and clean everything from it? Yeah,

545
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,403
yeah. If I don't have it, they said that,

546
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:40,056
yeah, it changes over me, it's fine. a little bit.

547
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:42,583
You can't even get it all by yourself. It's been a day to think

548
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:46,086
it's a big, you can't just get it and leave without setting a date

549
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,314
with it. Yes. So if you're a- Oh,

550
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:52,731
some estimates can you tell if dates said is had a-is had a-is had-was

551
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,350
had a blast and, and it-becues your- later,

552
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:59,206
we said later date for every childhood that could sit in.

553
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:04,020
Also, your only job has been estimated since-it's-it's-it's-it's.

554
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,082
So, what about the job? For example,

555
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:12,091
it's back to the job-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's.

556
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:14,509
And, there we have one exvisVO, 400 sec.

557
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:16,789
So, the changes that we're doing now,

558
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:19,213
it's good to go! Alright? Ok. See ya bye Bater.

559
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:21,270
I'll that. If they don't have that,

560
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,021
they'd send Jira how they'd get it. Ok.

561
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:26,345
Then we get it. He's like like, yeah,

562
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:28,752
he'll still have to start now. Just. We'll week. We're going to murder me

563
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,099
in the state group. Kind of this, but you can say it's up.

564
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,241
I just want you to take a lot of money,

565
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:35,582
and you've got to zoom and tell me what you're talking about.

566
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:39,501
Thank you Yeah, uhm, that will benefit both your job anyway.

567
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,051
But the actual compilation of the hours will not be affected.

568
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:48,760
Good. Okay. Yeah, it's automatically adjusted because there's too much

569
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,928
running between some of that print and handling.

570
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:53,303
Yeah, so that'll change. See Okay, we'll be there. Yes.

571
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,090
So the- the- the- the- the- the changes that won't be on there are

572
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:58,599
gonna be the first changes that we've made last night.

573
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:03,235
Hey, that's where we- this thing goes to this and it'll be like,

574
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,029
well, all the way around to the two sides.

575
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,280
It's actually that one thing. You know,

576
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:10,347
it's going to take care of the things that people say.

577
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,797
So, I guess that's a great phrase.

578
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,445
The labor could change on this,

579
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,271
but even- Even if the day is clear there,

580
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:22,799
if you change, I'll try to question it because

581
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:25,616
it's laying real good. Umm,

582
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,835
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

583
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:32,131
yeah, yeah,

584
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,530
What is that? It's really interesting, well, it can be,

585
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,657
uhm, yeah, you know,

586
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:40,176
it's an original set, set, but not the same as,

587
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:42,738
Oh, god, it's the, It's, uh,

588
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:45,247
say it has a lot of different effects.

589
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,328
It's not effective on a labor chain.

590
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,722
They will go, So, let's say we got six months from now.

591
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,163
We read it, and uh, really aren't there.

592
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:58,738
Look at all the stuff. And then we'll have all the stuff. Is there

593
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:01,425
a way to remove that thing? You can say we do want it to

594
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,451
be. Oh, there it is. There we go.

595
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:05,870
Yes. Yes. Okay, well, what's that?

596
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,292
That's not what my people could do. So, it's the most important part. It's

597
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:11,840
what we need. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Press is ready.

598
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,750
If going to I don't know It's not the part of it. But if

599
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,461
you can't be the part of it, it's just gonna get over.

600
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:19,681
Then in the business, we're gonna be getting rid of it.

601
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,796
That's all. All the labor and everything long together to get out of that.

602
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:25,987
So, one thing I'm paying attention to. So.

603
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,279
So, I'm assuming D.O.

604
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,996
Department of State, E.S. and D.O. would set the E.S.

605
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:34,670
on to the L.I.T.I.S. 6 for the technology world.

606
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:35,980
But E.S.O., E.S.O., E

607
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,833
Oh, yeah, that's good. They're out of this point,

608
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,985
people. So, yeah, shit, shit. Or two of them,

609
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:51,771
shit, nah, it's a bit loose. Two guys are out in the building.

610
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:54,401
Bye. I'm not gonna do that.

611
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:58,617
Statuspage, yeah, type. Press to the same. You should not be an inviscid person.

612
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:03,110
for the new video. Okay, and I just speak to you just a little

613
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,379
bit. Umm, maybe a bit of a mark on the issues of labor.

614
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,732
Dartmouth is now at the end of April. Look at the jobs part because

615
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,291
it don't happen. Look at the English names, fair notes.

616
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,436
Dartmouth is now at the end of April. Yeah, that's what it is.

617
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:18,202
You really don't- I have too many issues with that people.

618
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,811
My boss has really been talking about it.

619
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,534
And I've got a base point. And he's got so much- But as much,

620
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:26,543
thank you very much. I mean, I'm not being a guy,

621
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,872
I'm reading the estimate.

622
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:32,191
Yeah. Go.

623
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:34,105
Well, I don't want to, I just want to see how it's being put

624
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,147
together this final month,

625
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:39,026
but it still gets larger than even the following. It's, it's being less important

626
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:42,223
on each tablet over here. Okay, so yes, but we need to have this,

627
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:45,330
like, I'm going to talk for a second, I'm not going to,

628
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:47,747
I might cancel out that, so I'm going to able to do that.

629
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,807
There we go. And yeah, it's a, you know,

630
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:52,369
even, you know, all sorts of people out there,

631
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,998
you know, and stuff in the entire brain, and you make it way for

632
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:57,441
them to come and make it so you can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,995
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:12,059
Yeah.

635
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,413
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

636
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:22,611
So, and then it's just like, okay. And so,

637
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,630
at least we're going to go to say thanks to the guys,

638
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:27,645
and being, you know, for us, it's time to do it.

639
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:29,806
So, I'm gonna, Go on that day,

640
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:32,533
we have, and he said, well, we're gonna use it, but I know I

641
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,753
was gonna keep it, it's gonna detect me.

642
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:38,316
So, I go ahead. . . attack by the hand of him,

643
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:41,569
so he puts him for me now, and I have to say to that

644
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:46,005
they come to you, that's what he is Check this,

645
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,263
I got it, you know. But,

646
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,379
one person has lots of the everything,

647
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,750
it's so dense. Yes. For instance, you know,

648
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,675
probably toward this year's the pie. You know what?

649
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:59,583
I've been hearing about him since. He seemed chaotic,

650
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,806
but I'm not even sure. Literally, actually, I was gay.

651
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:04,666
That's how you do it all. Those guys are the best.

652
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,251
They're all the best, they're all the they're all they're all the best.

653
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:12,009
As I said in most accounts, I'll bring and have pretty years this month

654
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,155
to be written. Keep going tomorrow when we jump right in my mind.

655
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,686
Thank you. You of course, uhm, PMs,

656
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,728
PTs, department management, department engineers,

657
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:23,669
and estimate of all the people that are the biggest.

658
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,795
Yes. If you, uh,

659
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,824
see everywhere you know, it's, it's,

660
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:30,050
I actually don't know about those y'all right in,

661
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,321
uh, okay, where, you know, a lot of people.

662
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,564
Uh, or two, you're worried about him.

663
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:37,435
He's going to be homeless a lot. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:39,786
Yeah. Yeah. I'll see you in the next one,

665
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:44,071
and the caption is, that's how I'm going to be sure the software,

666
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,565
and then just throw it out and say, there you get it. There goes.

667
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:50,857
There There it goes. Bye. And then it comes back and says,

668
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,490
yeah, this is the one, this is the tool where you can make

669
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:58,463
this is the one. Bye I'm using that tool and I'm not sure if

670
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,524
I, I'm actually make sure you go out there,

671
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:02,778
right? So if anybody asks me anything else,

672
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:05,421
I'm going to get out of this. Okay. Yeah. So it's time to look

673
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:08,126
at this while we're sitting here. Yeah. So this back to,

674
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,856
okay. And so the question I was asking.

675
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,138
Okay. Uh, Gavin.

676
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:17,217
Right. They're good. Hey Bean.

677
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:21,270
There, and it was the R. The R is the- And then we updated,

678
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:23,670
so we had a bunch of them before we took off. Mm-hmm.

679
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:27,903
And then, Steve and they added that extra fill-up weld.

680
00:35:27,904 --> 00:35:30,110
Go. Well,

681
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,291
on the end of it, the end of it.

682
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:34,354
Yeah. Which, in my mind,

683
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:39,013
is it your departure sentence? Cheers! I would set up a conference.

684
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:42,505
Yeah. Wasn't actually what I'd do.

685
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:45,521
We'll see you a little bit. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. . Good question.

686
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:49,189
I don't want Something I've been reading.

687
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,356
Something I've been reading. I don't want to run a gun.

688
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,599
Yeah, I don't get the drawings. I mean,

689
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,143
I can't, I can't get looked at chakla and looked at the drawings because

690
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:02,122
I don't have a velvet bucket. Okay. Because I looked at details and I

691
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:04,419
looked at chakla. I'm not there yet.

692
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,829
It's just being heard. I was in this area.

693
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,951
We might need that. Okay. Bye. Okay,

694
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:13,112
well, this is probably in the middle. I have plenty of news over here,

695
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,589
and I have emails over here, and I close through it,

696
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,891
and I'm also looking at- Okay, I got that.

697
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:20,621
That's fine. That's Technically expect part of the revenue program.

698
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:24,020
Let's do it again. I'll you in video.

699
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:27,689
Bye Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, you are correct that,

700
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:32,371
you know, I think it's so. So,

701
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:36,137
Other than that story, I won't be using that quite often.

702
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:38,404
I'm a bit of a late drawing.

703
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,022
So that's how I'm going to be. Thank you. These one-off things were out

704
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:45,384
for me. Uhm.

705
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:48,006
I'll throw the wheel in that way. Yeah, that's not the right.

706
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,719
Bye. Go to, uh, NCS,

707
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,235
one of them. There's a 59 page,

708
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,371
combined file. Go up.

709
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:00,737
Yeah, that's what the whole set. Yeah, it should be fitting to know I

710
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,339
made that when I was in the parking lot. And then there's a lot

711
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,753
of ways to combine this. You just combine it. Yeah, that's what I'm going

712
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:10,430
to scale on. So they pulled that one B off

713
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,726
of a page 30 set. Page three.

714
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,778
Great. Page three. Page three.

715
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,385
Page three is the standard details. Yeah.

716
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:21,096
I looked at all the standard details myself. So.

717
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:24,297
Any label that's three?

718
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,510
Yeah. There you go. Yeah.

719
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,096
And I looked at all of these so they have brows and they have,

720
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:34,804
Exactly, okay. These are just

721
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:39,043
standard animal-driven men of the main portion.

722
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:45,393
or, The work is still here to come. Keep it along with them.

723
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,657
Here they go. So, when Statuspage 3, what does he say? I don't know.

724
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:52,142
If you look at the drawings down there above my border,

725
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,211
I don't see. See you next it says what one?

726
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,350
Well, they are all different.

727
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:01,613
They don't really have what I see in that NA-T number.

728
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:04,398
That is the F. You are trying and removed.

729
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:08,428
They are mixed up, so we just pay five. Yeah,

730
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:11,076
the uh, NA-T is just nature. Be sure to,

731
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:13,711
Yeah, but that's those are individual drawing numbers.

732
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,399
That should be using. There's not an order in the drawing set.

733
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,609
You know,

734
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:26,647
so those should be that page should actually be referencing the page that he's

735
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:29,231
falling from. Bye bye. Okay, good. Go back now and go on.

736
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:31,653
Nice. Well,

737
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:34,021
thank you. You guys had an 18-year-old vote.

738
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,248
What's that? Which is? . . That's a number,

739
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,328
anything, one, one, 18-six. That's a drawing number that should be used because those

740
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:43,137
are the past little drawings listed. I'll show

741
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:44,401
you on this I that's a I'm at it. You film. Promise those aren't

742
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:46,470
in the order of being this is it.

743
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:51,087
You know, my guess is there's some that are

744
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:55,848
that's in the- My guess is category is gonna be our best

745
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,200
fellow model. So, he's doing a takeout. Let's go.

746
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:02,066
So, when you're going to use a theme style,

747
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:04,720
you've got to quantify the columns,

748
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:07,716
quantify the braces. Uh. No.

749
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:09,615
No. And it has to have to make separate,

750
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:13,241
so this is your turbine building,

751
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,756
vertical beams. Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:18,646
Okay. So, considering,

753
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,589
you're going to get a counting on this thing,

754
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,791
it feels good. Uh. Bye.

755
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,810
Like, the total W deems the best. Yeah.

756
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,466
Yeah, me is totally the best. I'm going to be the best.

757
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,345
I'm going to be best.

758
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:33,556
That's Yeah, I still don't know.

759
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:37,359
But then they don't rank it. Oh, because when you highlighted it,

760
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,444
it grabbed display. Yeah.

761
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,555
There go. If you are alive, it doesn't, it doesn't change that.

762
00:39:42,572 --> 00:39:44,653
It just goes with a 1, 3, 7, 8,

763
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:47,916
that's like it. But it still says that in that- I'm sorry.

764
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,299
It's not displaying. There's 370 companies.

765
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,693
Yeah. So,

766
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,920
he saw me. It's, it's 16,000.

767
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:59,215
Tons. So, he's got a shitload of more comin'.

768
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:03,996
Yeah, right now he's at, Do you know what?

769
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:07,781
He's got million in the monitor for a total of two million in the

770
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,994
rest. So,

771
00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:12,137
stop. Oh. So,

772
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:14,952
I find it interesting as I begin looking at the hours,

773
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:17,102
12,000 hours. Yeah.

774
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:20,199
We're not even close to where we are. I wish you all a little

775
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,587
end up. If we trust my technical setup,

776
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,821
like, oh my geez. But,

777
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:29,219
so, we'd mostly, I mean,

778
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,949
uh, the main error will be the category,

779
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,211
so, that's the way it sits. Let's take a look.

780
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:38,834
I don't how to solve it. And,

781
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:43,531
uh, I couldn't understand this. This is our disease so far.

782
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:46,030
Oh, no. And, uh,

783
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:49,050
since this is going to be far, this is the emultifier cost of these.

784
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:52,966
So. Alright, so we'll see you guys the next uhm,

785
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:56,549
simply with this, uhm.

786
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,276
So, wait a minute. So. So,

787
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:03,337
Wait a minute. Beams are the best thing.

788
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,924
We can call on the line of 5-4-2. Uh,

789
00:41:06,935 --> 00:41:11,238
it seems like it's 2. You have to be multi-partners wearing periods and showing

790
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,488
the page number you're going to find out.

791
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,356
Or just, it's not. That is not the best thing.

792
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:20,061
. So you got a new U12, a 542,

793
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,415
though, I think it's an elevation. It is.

794
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:27,900
Yeah. Alright. You Sounds like we're almost gone at this point.

795
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,455
So we can always pass here on the piece of rod.

796
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:36,499
Bye Always

797
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,100
all I'm hearing. Yeah, he's listening to all the posts right now.

798
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:43,104
Mm. Mm. Okay,

799
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:46,170
we need the next slide. We need to help us understand it.

800
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,396
You Which,

801
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:54,002
uhm,

802
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:56,561
so the question is,

803
00:41:56,562 --> 00:42:00,896
Um, how do you figure out, like, what page is associated with what area

804
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,969
of work and, you know, in this sense,

805
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:04,740
essentially? Okay. Thank you.

806
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,834
He's listening right now.

807
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:19,737
I think there's three of them.

808
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:21,918
You have courage.

809
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:24,808
Uh, uh, uh, currently it's U.S.

810
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,882
Mayors. The U.S. mayors. mayors. The mayors.

811
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:29,824
The mayors that are using the tech helper. Okay. Nice to make sure you're

812
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:32,722
around here. Where they are, they're on the with different thought.

813
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:38,201
Nut instead of. Mm hmm. We are now in.

814
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:41,680
So. Go ahead.

815
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:56,464
Sedera Kingdom.

816
00:42:57,307 --> 00:43:00,889
Yo, why I do like page one, which means the first love.

817
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,144
Well, So, this is the first one of one.

818
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,583
And then, like, Category, it's gonna know of either,

819
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:11,295
like, B, I mean, columns weren't doing estimate,

820
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:14,321
so. It's related to local,

821
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:17,251
like, specific, food feed or something like that.

822
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:19,890
And then when stuck by the volume,

823
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,998
you should be going to be anything that's attached to that.

824
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,291
Let's see, like, base break. All over.

825
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,511
Specific, right?

826
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:33,212
Cheap break. And the card is gonna be Sunday.

827
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:36,632
you I'm gonna be sure I can verify that we've got estimated to be.

828
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,832
It's gonna take us, I know, like, w We'll the next one. Okay,

829
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:46,311
so, you know,

830
00:43:46,312 --> 00:43:49,423
for the conference,

831
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:52,068
right? I'm gonna be, what do you see that it sounds?

832
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:57,069
See, it's only all the problems with that London.

833
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,983
Relay it. Zero all the way to the group.

834
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:04,133
The main vendors, cause this is, this is the commons.

835
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:07,918
All we have our phones. So I,

836
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:09,976
dude, take off for one common,

837
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:12,578
only in the, like, month of fire or things like that.

838
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:17,094
Cool. Same case for the

839
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:20,457
new, the second one.

840
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,271
Cool. Sure, I did the take off for one.

841
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:29,118
We have one that attaches to where I've been able to find my floor.

842
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:34,774
We did it in three. It's going to be,

843
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:38,961
uhm, specific or though I did put the football piece separately.

844
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:41,316
Thank you much.

845
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:43,538
3, 4,

846
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:48,626
5. If you knew, you knew the sense would be pressing.

847
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:53,880
Eh. you ehm.

848
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:59,669
Thank And in here,

849
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,094
this is the very first one that locations.

850
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:10,300
Cheers! And

851
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:13,168
this is only like a comma, so we need to take out for it

852
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:17,796
in person. So this

853
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:21,277
is a standard way of doing it, or is this your way of doing

854
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:25,927
it? . . . . Take in your

855
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:29,621
process, my friend.

856
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:33,380
Umm, tell us a standard when I'm doing it,

857
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:36,440
or is this your way? It's my way,

858
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:40,260
can you? . Okay.

859
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,470
Okay. We gotta change it. Oh,

860
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:45,691
look, sound outside of it, find it in easy way.

861
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:47,704
Thank you for all of us. Sarah,

862
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:52,383
I think it looks good the way it is. Awesome.

863
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:55,938
Thank you, Grandma. Appreciate that. . One thing you can do is,

864
00:45:56,303 --> 00:46:01,575
if that can't be set the category

865
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:04,287
to, uhh. . I don't know.

866
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:07,473
You can't be a keeper. And then all those pieces would have,

867
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,291
like, all the columns pieces would have, all the characters.

868
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,146
. . . . . But, in fact, you'd have to be the management

869
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,039
and if Well, I, I, um, you know, I, I, of course, I,

870
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:19,971
it's a hold on. I've said that

871
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:29,920
okay, when it turned on to where it all lives in the back.

872
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,382
Reviewing this all a lot is your, so,

873
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:37,196
so, so much. What you're saying is what we see on page one through

874
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:41,771
twelve will be down below sunrise by whatever

875
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:44,744
you recruit. And that's, it won't be so drastic here,

876
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:47,606
but there's tons of reporting based on it.

877
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:50,311
And worry that, yeah, you can get a poll report about it.

878
00:46:50,312 --> 00:46:55,015
That's category summary. So what's the difference between reporting and category column?

879
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,659
Pulling it in here. That's, that's,

880
00:46:57,795 --> 00:47:01,478
these are all. . Okay, so if you pop up,

881
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,791
do count a little bit. Pop up and category is clicked on columns.

882
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:08,612
1 B B B All you can get is the one line.

883
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:13,518
You don't get all the columns. Cause not all the items that are columns

884
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:16,624
are thickness. But if you be able to work them.

885
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,706
Yeah. Yeah. So what I'm saying is,

886
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,125
it's essentially a quick way to look at it before,

887
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:23,302
if you tag it. Correct, correct,

888
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,335
correct. So you're saying it's a bit open,

889
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:29,239
folks. It would have been better for some of the tag,

890
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,055
it's one as a call. already this here. Yes, sir. In all these associated

891
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:36,649
with gum, did I have any other copy and paste the first one on

892
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,293
the way down with a chemical? Yeah. All I'll have fun. All right. Yeah,

893
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:40,317
Vyz. That's cool. Yeah, you can just go up there to this,

894
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:42,563
you're a certain guy. But, yeah,

895
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:47,370
you can get this all up in the same- And so you use a

896
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:49,534
preference, Jira. Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:54,433
Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Yeah,

898
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:58,063
that's it. That's kind of the, sort of the category so that you can

899
00:47:58,064 --> 00:48:00,094
then, let me see you call up out.

900
00:48:00,095 --> 00:48:02,664
So if you click on that filter down there, you call up the computer

901
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:05,669
if you use it. Look. So really,

902
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,864
if you were to pull down columns right there,

903
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:11,311
it's basically a piece mark plus all the pieces that make that.

904
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:14,136
. . . . piece mark. . . Yeah, if you had them off

905
00:48:14,137 --> 00:48:16,370
that. . . Yeah. . . . . Yeah.

906
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:19,320
. . Yeah. .

907
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:21,908
So . . . Yeah. . . It's easy . . . It's easy

908
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:24,102
. . have to help to treat . . . Right. . You should

909
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,375
understand . . . Yeah. . So .

910
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:29,589
. . You . . . What percent complete are you?

911
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:30,402
Thank you.

912
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,464
Uh, well I'm not far from even a spinner, you know,

913
00:48:38,484 --> 00:48:39,540
there's food stuck with it. Good.

914
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:59,331
Here,

915
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:07,507
let me stop. So I'm going to be, I'm

916
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:09,695
getting this copy. It's so fun. It's a lot of service.

917
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:13,891
as soon as we uhm,

918
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:17,442
I don't even think it'll go back to it. Umm,

919
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:20,090
one of the main things I want to- look at today and look at

920
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,487
it yesterday, was the contract in New Jersey,

921
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:25,470
and it has just since marked the news.

922
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,937
Now- you here is in the middle of all one, so we can go

923
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:34,416
on and take a look at that portion of it.

924
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:38,971
So this is,

925
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:46,036
They by that news that this does get me a,

926
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:49,327
a, a, like, what they call it, a, a form of a new result

927
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:52,201
that is coming from us, but, uh. Umm,

928
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:54,248
it's, uh, it does create a,

929
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:56,818
a, a, the, the thing with all the functions,

930
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,956
uh, and, and, and, right. All right.

931
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:02,789
So, uh, we got to put in our schedule values and all that before

932
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,540
we can do our schedule, before we do our conference,

933
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:08,270
uh, or do our events. And, uh,

934
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:12,924
here's the other tab first. There's actually more money.

935
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:16,289
Whatever your takeover came to you, sir. We're called the team and they're some

936
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,088
change-in. And they need to put in the other information.

937
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:21,509
If you want, I mean, it's, uh, ehm. So,

938
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,806
what about contract items and then- Well, the new contract items are very much

939
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:27,981
capable of avenues in here, uh, uhm, uhm,

940
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:30,460
uhm, uhm, uhm,

941
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,306
uhm, uhm. I don't know simple complex you wanna do,

942
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:36,858
but even though I just need detail and I have to issue the,

943
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:39,156
uhm, where are you gonna do somethin'?

944
00:50:39,157 --> 00:50:43,315
I'm 34 on MediRoute. I think that's a really great big shot,

945
00:50:43,316 --> 00:50:46,224
I think. I think he's still here.

946
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,678
I really like I'm going to use it again with a lot of sound.

947
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,480
You know what I mean? Yes.

948
00:50:55,231 --> 00:50:57,795
I think it's all delivered to a live-out. It's a lot to do if

949
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:00,407
you receive it. Yeah. It's exactly what it will be.

950
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:00,839
All right. Thank you.

951
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:16,311
This

952
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:24,810
is how she did it. You Yeah, this one could be some large buckets,

953
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:27,391
so that's it.

954
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:29,830
Very good. We'll never think that, but right.

955
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:32,964
They ask most of us to copy this into,

956
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:35,491
into. So.

957
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:40,177
So those categories then also

958
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:42,662
apply the project management phase of this.

959
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:44,958
you Uhm,

960
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,824
yes, so all of the Jira were in the fashion control and they had

961
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:51,516
bad voyages for it, so that he could, there's actually no rewarding them.

962
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:54,001
. Yeah, you're a cat boy, you can't get your cat But that private

963
00:51:54,002 --> 00:51:56,288
instanceg animal bound? Um,

964
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:59,551
no O Sporty, there's no value you've seen on the whole for many seasons.

965
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:02,334
But, um,

966
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:05,341
Bob, so, the stable pass right there,

967
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:07,596
don't know if it's- And if,

968
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:10,244
All that now is historical good schedule.

969
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:15,327
So you can tie the line item on the- on the contracted-

970
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:17,966
Good night. Good night. You can voice them to a line item to the

971
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,306
schedule. And when you go to the bill,

972
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,324
they'll say, okay, that line item on the schedule is just for Sunday.

973
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:25,495
Okay. It'll,

974
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:29,739
it'll, it'll, for me, they'll send me, they'll send me the bill that,

975
00:52:30,068 --> 00:52:32,095
you know, uh, it'll just cost. You Plus,

976
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:35,168
uh, Chuck's a complete, we may, we may not be able to bill it,

977
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:38,231
but at least an idiot n'er, says, here's not already,

978
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:41,225
you all, you're in at this. If you get a job,

979
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:43,827
it ain't five, you know, whatever, seven. But,

980
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:47,316
and then the time up there, we have a commercial contract,

981
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:50,030
the heather. You helps you with change work. We come back,

982
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,637
we come back to change work as well,

983
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,764
but, and show you how that go change button.

984
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:58,758
And I'll make it. Ditching orders and reaching orders and reaching as well,

985
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,859
I'm sorry for the magnitude of distance.

986
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:03,876
Or in the form automatically. I'm not a cleaning.

987
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:06,350
I mean, I'm not even building it in which way you want to set

988
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:09,863
the original contract value and then give you all the change orders,

989
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:11,916
current contract value, but I don't see. Thank you.

990
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:13,942
Yeah, and it doesn't. Yeah, sir. Yeah,

991
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:15,966
it has the typical number of issues. Yeah,

992
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:19,140
yeah, it was original contract value.

993
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:22,494
Okay, so. Thank you. Yeah, it does all that. Yeah. I'll get where you

994
00:53:22,495 --> 00:53:27,836
guys have to go out there and please stay.

995
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,131
Okay. If you can do it that way today. For more about,

996
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:34,991
sorry, I missed what you did for a second. So as long as jobs

997
00:53:35,236 --> 00:53:39,904
are gonna be rewritten, with. And you always, I think you always

998
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:42,612
want to know your original value.

999
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:47,601
You want to- how all the sum of change orders gets you out current,

1000
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:50,794
and you want to know about the current change order,

1001
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:54,179
except you're submitting. Hey. Hey. Hey. Do you guys track all that?

1002
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,005
You've got a manual? Umm,

1003
00:53:57,016 --> 00:54:00,151
that's also part of my need for the rest of my life.

1004
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:04,698
It's a very clear depiction of original us and chain orders in the

1005
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:07,055
total value of the project.

1006
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:10,036
You need a remark. alarm. Chain orders is a word in alarm.

1007
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:15,335
In these submitting stages, unless it's awarded it once in the total budget

1008
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:18,149
value. You can't do that, you're too lucky.

1009
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:20,485
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

1010
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:24,276
uh, so. Yeah, Uber. Thank you very much.

1011
00:54:24,277 --> 00:54:26,867
I'm here. So,

1012
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:30,727
I'm in the region, you're using Pro-Corps.

1013
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:32,796
We'll see in a minute.

1014
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:36,158
It's your historical tool. You're going with it,

1015
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:38,938
and it has a long road. Give it.

1016
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:43,768
You wouldn't have thought it was the head.

1017
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:48,511
Pardon me from all of us, and I'll see you in a minute.

1018
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:51,806
This one's going to get a warning. It's not supposed to be gone or

1019
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,848
not, it's better after you watch it's supposed to be gone,

1020
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,481
and then they figured it out. Bye bye. That since we're not pushing the

1021
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:02,444
files through here, and we're just trying to ask the next through here,

1022
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:07,396
the actual, I don't know if that ain't going down,

1023
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:10,390
or if the weather ain't being pushed through the system.

1024
00:55:10,788 --> 00:55:13,894
And, uh, sorry. Harvey. 7 I don't know.

1025
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:17,570
I'm not going to leave it before the weather ain't down.

1026
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:19,656
People were asking me. So I was only looking under a certain value we

1027
00:55:19,657 --> 00:55:22,309
could actually still trust. No. No. By having the system,

1028
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:25,767
which about a lot of people will use for chain orders,

1029
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:28,591
uhm, evidence. times.

1030
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:31,516
Simple, simple things that goes through,

1031
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:33,997
so. But in this section,

1032
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,007
we're going to have to be paying. Yes.

1033
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:39,720
All right. Well, it's extra consolidated and it has to be done.

1034
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,505
Yeah. I mean, I didn't work from, like you said,

1035
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:45,795
from gorgeous still. I don't make live quizzes.

1036
00:55:46,308 --> 00:55:49,037
Easier than the universe.

1037
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,599
Easier than the term, right? It's- this.

1038
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,901
It's I know what the amount of- it's kind of like it's in all

1039
00:55:56,902 --> 00:56:00,868
data. It's forming people up a little bit so spreadsheet to get their- I

1040
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:03,496
don't know what the answer there will be no sale,

1041
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:04,773
I don't know the answer. Okay.

1042
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:13,618
Please just be part of any accounting person to figure out who system

1043
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,948
stuff's in. Yeah, I mean,

1044
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:20,193
I won't be. I'm gonna pick the tool and get it with me on

1045
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:23,698
it. What matters, technically, whether it's credit for work,

1046
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:27,679
as long as it's consistent. It's just, You know, I don't wanna,

1047
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,833
I'd rather get it, but it's just gonna seem that I'm gonna figure out

1048
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:39,695
where I am today. Good day. And

1049
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:44,201
protocol is probably, uhm, You more

1050
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:47,250
tuned to some of this, some of this stuff,

1051
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:50,551
right? But,

1052
00:56:50,552 --> 00:56:52,900
. As Icards, it might be more,

1053
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,114
you might I don't know what's the word with any- Might be,

1054
00:56:57,115 --> 00:56:59,556
sex orops it might be. But ahaha.. Nun Goose!!

1055
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:04,095
I hear the person who understands the finance that

1056
00:57:04,096 --> 00:57:09,034
best says the form of a spirit. Here. It's

1057
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:11,924
me having a boyfriend, and she's,

1058
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:14,526
uh, she's super busy. Heh. Thank you.

1059
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:27,542
We've got a hand in cheek.

1060
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:27,670
.

1061
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:43,815
Notice there's a routine there too,

1062
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:45,864
so like, I used to try on the same. Okay,

1063
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:49,296
I'll be over a table and shut up and it should be improved.

1064
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:53,631
Okay, you should only be held on their action portion of the contract and

1065
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:56,820
not be held on a very good lesson of the presentation.

1066
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:59,267
So. So, If I was successful there,

1067
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,236
even though they don't write a language, um,

1068
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,376
on all the materials and everything, they'll be able to see your record.

1069
00:58:05,377 --> 00:58:11,038
So, we've got to come.

1070
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:15,581
You might be okay. So,

1071
00:58:15,582 --> 00:58:18,353
there's our schedule about an inch there.

1072
00:58:18,354 --> 00:58:21,451
So, let's close this. We'll see you now.

1073
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:25,045
We have a total schedule. We have to approve change orders to the contract.

1074
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:28,052
No approved change orders to the contract. No approved change either.

1075
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:31,682
So, if we were to- I'm not feeling this now that we've had the

1076
00:58:31,683 --> 00:58:36,230
invoices. There are no invoices that won't leave

1077
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:39,178
me. No approved. Now we have all the information at the top.

1078
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:41,476
Put them in our baits, uhm,

1079
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,993
or put them in. In fact, sure. Engage is great.

1080
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:47,587
Of course to use right. Bye. People are superior in daily revolution.

1081
00:58:47,766 --> 00:58:50,093
But we don't go in those kids, right? Yeah,

1082
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:53,616
they're not being there in the top bag, but. Now play with the bottom.

1083
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:56,862
All we're doing is, we're either putting it up or saying,

1084
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,760
we're not gonna say that Jira's was 50% percent of the way we're gonna

1085
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:05,063
go right there. Let's just reach one,

1086
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:07,246
yep, great. Yup, yep, yep.

1087
00:59:07,412 --> 00:59:09,691
Let's look how long we want to listen. What's that?

1088
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:12,703
I think we just want $5,000, so I'm really good at the current,

1089
00:59:12,704 --> 00:59:16,328
completely work. And just putting $5,000,

1090
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:19,154
you're getting it even more. before. You're getting $5,000,

1091
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,356
or if you think he's doing it,

1092
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:25,563
yep. So, it's pretty.

1093
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:27,994
We're ready. It's pretty simple on my, uh, thanks for this.

1094
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:29,996
I used to have them where,

1095
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:33,624
you know, all project managers did not do.

1096
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:36,607
You the actual wheel, but they had a different version of what,

1097
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:40,182
you know, so they would do this, then what's,

1098
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:46,377
what, because it's very certain. . . And then they would send documentation

1099
00:59:46,794 --> 00:59:49,891
to the lady that I did.

1100
00:59:49,892 --> 00:59:53,420
. . And she had all the numbers that she needed.

1101
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:57,936
. they should give you a little texture to their documents.

1102
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:00,247
What would she do? . do? .

1103
01:00:00,248 --> 01:00:04,520
. Does this block or do anything else in the background?

1104
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,808
. . Um. Like what?

1105
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:09,521
. Let's say, uh,

1106
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:12,215
I'm 100% influenced,

1107
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:16,714
but I'm still working on Could I actually work on it because it's 100%

1108
01:00:16,715 --> 01:00:19,689
influenced, but it doesn't set blocks at all. Not at all.

1109
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,051
Not at all. Not at all.

1110
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:26,044
It's different. You're the first to know what we love through the end of

1111
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:28,640
the month, so it's not that accurate. Today,

1112
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:32,900
at the end of this month. So close that panel.

1113
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:36,734
Can I tie this to shipping?

1114
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,799
Like if I say, I'm 100%. And ship will you fly me in the

1115
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,268
hood? If, if, uh,

1116
01:00:42,279 --> 01:00:44,613
I'm shipping what I'm on the stage room,

1117
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,858
it's time to ship me. And, yeah,

1118
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:49,278
I think I'm tired of doing this, but I don't want to ship it.

1119
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,656
I want to ship it. So,

1120
01:00:51,668 --> 01:00:55,687
you guys gotta follow me on the list. Yeah. Yeah. So,

1121
01:00:55,688 --> 01:00:58,748
give me the drop down to the top now, and it reports,

1122
01:00:59,419 --> 01:01:01,580
do the 702 to the 703.

1123
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:04,266
3 2 7 I think that this is a pretty marked version.

1124
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:06,372
You can't just sit down and use your mother. Hey,

1125
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:08,654
eh, eh, eh, and you have to go. Hey,

1126
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:11,070
eh, you got to go down. Right here. It's good.

1127
01:01:11,164 --> 01:01:13,565
So there's your typical first page, right? Yeah.

1128
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:19,546
Run the seven and three as well. Thank you. Your

1129
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:23,918
typical second page. So,

1130
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:26,371
erm, yep. So that's,

1131
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:28,779
It's a really easy to use.

1132
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:31,036
It's really easy to use. You know, it's gonna be easy to do.

1133
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:34,043
are well. The thing about this is you don't break a spreadsheet.

1134
01:01:34,044 --> 01:01:36,229
Rishi. Everyone's a spreadsheet for this,

1135
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,055
right? Uh, you don't break a spreadsheet here.

1136
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:41,816
We used to always do that. And just like, okay, next month.

1137
01:01:41,817 --> 01:01:45,655
Now. No. It seems like our links to the prior pay gap where I

1138
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:49,366
was broken or so, so my screw up formula and Vince did not flow

1139
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:51,962
in for. Yeah. We'll see the last moment,

1140
01:01:51,963 --> 01:01:56,612
right? So this, we're going to be inside.

1141
01:01:57,303 --> 01:02:01,602
Sorry. We're just not making sure your plates are available underneath.

1142
01:02:01,603 --> 01:02:05,595
Can it, uh, can it track what I did the previous two months?

1143
01:02:05,883 --> 01:02:08,877
Oh yeah. Thank you. Can it project what I did the next five months?

1144
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:11,593
They're both projecting the thing for you.

1145
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:14,611
Oh, the thing, the schedule building on there.

1146
01:02:14,612 --> 01:02:18,778
How much you should be on. So, really could run 19 plus five.

1147
01:02:18,779 --> 01:02:22,178
Can you do that? Yeah. Yeah. So let's,

1148
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,843
let's move. Go. Great to change order, Stephen. So,

1149
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:27,690
is that our main today for you guys to do two plus five?

1150
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:32,248
Bye-bye. I'm pretty sure

1151
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,451
somebody in the county doesn't. Yeah. I think it's not people who do the

1152
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,550
longer books in the afternoon. Umm,

1153
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,660
yeah. Yeah. Marcus, if you know what I mean.

1154
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:45,198
And Marcus, if you know what this is the,

1155
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,388
this is the, this is the real test. I'm gonna have a little bit

1156
01:02:49,389 --> 01:02:51,634
of a feeling this is 2 p.m. with the shop, and we did it.

1157
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,816
Pass and I'm gonna make a little bit of it. I did it.

1158
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:57,570
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm cheering the,

1159
01:02:57,852 --> 01:03:00,393
the intro project of the 5 acres,

1160
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,856
and I'm 10 days behind. Not in the room,

1161
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:04,871
I'm flavored. I'm a bunch of stuff.

1162
01:03:04,872 --> 01:03:08,411
I can't see any of it. I can't believe you can stay right here

1163
01:03:08,412 --> 01:03:10,704
on the show. It makes no sense!

1164
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:14,153
Next. I say, you're not project management at that point.

1165
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:18,717
You know, if you're not able to be close to your real kind of

1166
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:21,408
stuff. So,

1167
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,901
do you know that?

1168
01:03:23,902 --> 01:03:26,656
I'm changing the numbers in here.

1169
01:03:26,657 --> 01:03:30,676
You have to change the numbers in here, too. You can do this. You

1170
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:33,045
have to change over the weather, until that,

1171
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:36,487
that. Close that, you have to second bend,

1172
01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:39,015
don't stave. Then close that out of here,

1173
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:41,200
bust it all the way out of here, get it out of there,

1174
01:03:41,201 --> 01:03:43,381
give it a change orders at the bottom. So,

1175
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:45,597
this is your change order problem. So,

1176
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:49,137
this war will stay in pain with the contract of the grossing.

1177
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,962
You said you were sending me- Yeah, change order dude.

1178
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:59,671
Supplier, you don't have to feel like most people don't.

1179
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:01,964
. That's the same, if you're right, you should,

1180
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:04,448
you know, change order and uhm,

1181
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,183
everything I'm basically just sitting at all, and I'm not gonna tag me more

1182
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:14,754
than good. Good. Good. If

1183
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:17,600
you get it, put it in. So. . . You apply it in there.

1184
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:19,625
It's basically all right. So,

1185
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:21,873
it's such a contact. If you did,

1186
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,536
put that in there and it's somewhere shorter.

1187
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:26,907
You have a report available. Here's what this guy says.

1188
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:30,060
That would be already in here. He'd be able to have it in our

1189
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:32,176
book. He changes that in his days.

1190
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:37,048
Thanks. Change will cause his dollar check.

1191
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:40,711
This is the movie in here. Probably since last time I was here.

1192
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:43,023
You could be uploading them about,

1193
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:46,014
or hit the cost of them next to it.

1194
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:51,273
It's saying it's going to overrun. Right. So,

1195
01:04:51,274 --> 01:04:54,369
if you have a change order that's in your estimate,

1196
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,731
you can review. You come from me.

1197
01:04:56,732 --> 01:05:01,312
That's my estimate. I'm following that over in the year to give you a

1198
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:03,352
breakdown. Basically, make sure you're later at other.

1199
01:05:03,353 --> 01:05:05,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So,

1200
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:09,099
that's really cool. The other thing you can do here is we can just

1201
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,367
do new, you know how they want the bright day and once they're working

1202
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:15,979
for a little bit. So, you can do moonkeeper and put in your bright

1203
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:20,310
day research. Um, and describe it out in the end.

1204
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:24,577
you you have the option to break out,

1205
01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:28,711
but you have the option with all that change order when you're sanding it.

1206
01:05:28,712 --> 01:05:31,862
. And whether you include the breakdown or you should do a lot of

1207
01:05:31,863 --> 01:05:34,149
stuff like the ones through the breakdowns. So thanks.

1208
01:05:34,404 --> 01:05:36,756
If you have multiple categories you can add.

1209
01:05:36,757 --> 01:05:39,883
The seven days and sub-the-seven days, if you want just to show you the

1210
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:43,482
seven days, not all the detail you can pull across like that.

1211
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:46,506
It wouldn't pull this. You use it for us or you can copy for

1212
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,876
restment. Actually, this did not be for restment,

1213
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:57,297
so I put this to it. So, such

1214
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,387
as pulling over, basically, your material,

1215
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,776
your labor. Thank you Thank you.

1216
01:06:01,777 --> 01:06:04,424
And then any type of, uhh,

1217
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:06,569
other type of breakdown, so,

1218
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,707
like, once a month, you won't. So.

1219
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:12,363
So, So it's like a little bit of the assembly,

1220
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:15,007
but I see the way it's pulled on over your toes. And then you

1221
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:17,796
won't feel so, you know, it's like, no. That's just funny.

1222
01:06:17,797 --> 01:06:20,076
6,500, Rovo, 14C,

1223
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,281
it's all about $38,000.

1224
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:25,584
So I'm changing the brand new, right? Or the outreach period.

1225
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:29,743
Good bye. I didn't want to show them 3.03 hours with 8,

1226
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,446
at 8 and worth 48 hours. You know,

1227
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,446
I want that to be 85. So I want the other one to be

1228
01:06:35,447 --> 01:06:38,179
$100 an hour or something. So you can put it right here if you

1229
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,699
want to. So I mean, these are cost members.

1230
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,985
Yeah. Yeah. I'm driving here to do the change order eventually you want to

1231
01:06:43,986 --> 01:06:46,421
have some, you know, cell numbers. Yeah.

1232
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:49,419
Yeah. For sure. Uh, that's why you can change your look.

1233
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:54,036
Uh. Uh. Actually, it's pulled a bit out of the mess of the

1234
01:06:54,037 --> 01:06:56,229
summer. So, it would be,

1235
01:06:56,556 --> 01:06:58,567
it would be, Uh,

1236
01:06:58,578 --> 01:07:02,488
selling companies would work, so. So yeah,

1237
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:04,994
if you have had it, then this is if you wanted to,

1238
01:07:05,149 --> 01:07:09,597
if you couldn't, So you're telling me there's cost fields and sell fields in

1239
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:13,244
the estimate? Mm-hmm. So you got to go back up to base setup to

1240
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:15,487
fix them. . . And then there's just,

1241
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,837
like, when you're doing the estimate, uh,

1242
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:20,063
I'm not really looking at corner of the estimate. There's, uh,

1243
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:23,186
there are bottom colors in the summary. That's the that's spread as you like.

1244
01:07:23,187 --> 01:07:26,732
Then we have a look at some, and then you do all your markups

1245
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:29,004
and your hats and everything that's in there.

1246
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:31,485
And. and you get your shadow,

1247
01:07:32,468 --> 01:07:37,124
of course. This

1248
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,189
is where you can wrap it up in the bottom of that breaker. I'm

1249
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:43,794
going to make it. . And you see

1250
01:07:43,795 --> 01:07:47,731
you're dropping over there. It's been a long time.

1251
01:07:47,732 --> 01:07:52,442
So once you do this,

1252
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,437
uh, give the chain order to pull out from the estimate.

1253
01:07:55,438 --> 01:08:00,256
Thank you much. Yeah,

1254
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:03,679
I'm $1,000, that's what- Yeah,

1255
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,979
I'm $1, that's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna little bit of water,

1256
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,090
right? Without being right,

1257
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,108
I'm gonna do much. So, you know, something Just give me a minute.

1258
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:14,305
Okay. Alright, so you have to leave me there.

1259
01:08:14,306 --> 01:08:16,651
I think we're gonna have to have a chat about more catch-up meetings.

1260
01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:21,287
The difference. So that

1261
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:25,959
would dwell on the gate.

1262
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:32,944
Ee-e-e-e-e-e-e. The I just didn't ee-e-o-y-e

1263
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:36,511
or not. But you say Egyptians by the way,

1264
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:42,210
it's a Still a

1265
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:44,236
little bit. Ehm. Absolutely not. So.

1266
01:08:44,237 --> 01:08:48,089
Good job. That's it. I'm looking for the part of this,

1267
01:08:48,178 --> 01:08:51,306
part of the equation to determine the margin.

1268
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:54,114
Right. for the cost of seven. I buy them myself.

1269
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,488
They did so. They aren't directing me later.

1270
01:08:56,489 --> 01:09:00,625
So, they're good. Thank joining us.

1271
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:03,922
It's a number that we're supposed to,

1272
01:09:04,196 --> 01:09:06,789
to stay in. We can't go below serving on your target.

1273
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:11,033
We'd rather not ten percent partial. March 11th. I said $100,

1274
01:09:11,034 --> 01:09:13,864
March 8th, and then I said $100,

1275
01:09:13,865 --> 01:09:16,428
and $25.

1276
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:20,196
So, Usually, trying to stay at a small tax or some market,

1277
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:24,751
and our market percentage is very due to getting a 40% increase.

1278
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:27,485
That's the cost, and that's the sell.

1279
01:09:27,486 --> 01:09:30,589
I mean, let me write this down for a second.

1280
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,912
So 46 down on the cost,

1281
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:36,267
62,000,

1282
01:09:36,268 --> 01:09:38,621
62,100.

1283
01:09:38,622 --> 01:09:42,057
Yeah. Good. So,

1284
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:44,957
that's the hand you're looking at, here's the bottom.

1285
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,735
Here. That's the hand you're looking at.

1286
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:50,352
You Well, I'm glad I started that.

1287
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,106
I can't believe your work matters. It's made me compliment.

1288
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:55,364
That's not how

1289
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:04,951
that's a 20, 6% movement, that's not perfect. Yeah. Yeah.

1290
01:10:06,257 --> 01:10:08,869
Yeah. Yeah. If you go below certain marks and there's problems,

1291
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,857
I'm not sure if you and if you go over to certain marks.

1292
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:16,195
All And they question,

1293
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:19,330
they may question to me. Except if you're in police, just absolutely.

1294
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:21,500
I'll do it I like having,

1295
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:24,086
hmmm, hmmm. I'm getting a Labour fight.

1296
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,933
I'm a From Auto-Java, I'm going to play first time.

1297
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:30,979
Okay. But of course we guys,

1298
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:35,794
tonight, that is where you expect to get an answer back on the

1299
01:10:35,795 --> 01:10:39,446
change order. Okay, good. Good That drives reporting to you here for us.

1300
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,453
Umm, Virginia, New person was.

1301
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,071
Just have to say a second. No more assessments.

1302
01:10:45,072 --> 01:10:47,502
Just to pay help or pull them out. I'm going to be familiar with

1303
01:10:47,503 --> 01:10:50,242
what he had just said. Of course, but he didn't even get reported.

1304
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:52,294
Automated reporting. Here you go.

1305
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,326
I'm going to get better. Okay. I'm going him y'all the ones I need

1306
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:55,835
to really get to check on. So, Thanks.

1307
01:11:01,231 --> 01:11:05,776
Are

1308
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,740
you guys estimating your own chain of h******? I guys enjoy this video.

1309
01:11:08,741 --> 01:11:12,203
Please subscribe to Bye! If you don't buy a cast, then you can listen

1310
01:11:12,204 --> 01:11:14,911
to your own chain of h******. Alright,

1311
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:18,516
start up your cast, and then it's good to be, Mark up on that

1312
01:11:18,517 --> 01:11:22,999
job, it's 35%, but the margin on that job is 26%.

1313
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,913
Yeah. you The accounting people

1314
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:31,263
will talk to you typically in margin with.

1315
01:11:31,264 --> 01:11:33,391
Thank you.

1316
01:11:33,392 --> 01:11:36,099
Yeah, that's the best of us in the province.

1317
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,618
We need to live with the markets, we need to get that product.

1318
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:44,169
Alright. But if you have a 35% margin,

1319
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,962
be a much higher market in the US as well.

1320
01:11:47,963 --> 01:11:50,340
Thank you very much.

1321
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:53,592
If Mom was in here, he would be very good at the markets.

1322
01:11:53,593 --> 01:11:59,505
Thank you very much. So,

1323
01:11:59,506 --> 01:12:03,075
it's funny because I mean, coding with villagers,

1324
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:07,103
they actually won't be. you If that thing will mark up,

1325
01:12:07,104 --> 01:12:09,628
it'll mark up better than us. No,

1326
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:12,648
just their spurtling shield.

1327
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:16,336
field. Especially like the other people,

1328
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:19,402
uh, finance people. They don't like that word,

1329
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:21,780
it just, you know, bark at campus.

1330
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,980
so here, marginalism, what their focus is on.

1331
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:29,350
The difference between the cost, the sole cost of it,

1332
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:30,720
so. So, Oh, gross. . .

1333
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:48,803
I need to, uh, interview some AI,

1334
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:52,059
so you know that type of a word. It just tries to go out

1335
01:12:52,084 --> 01:12:54,469
and I call the cops too. Thank you. Thank you. Alright.

1336
01:12:54,470 --> 01:13:20,925
And that concludes of season. 7 4

1337
01:13:20,926 --> 01:13:22,991
minutes in the end, sir. It's like,

1338
01:13:22,993 --> 01:13:25,647
oh, we're gonna let him get back in contact with him.

1339
01:13:25,648 --> 01:13:27,871
He through a lot, I don't know, it's here to bat. Bye!

1340
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:32,909
Oh, please, I'll include him on one shaker,

1341
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:36,981
three second shaker. the reason I'm in the trailer.

1342
01:13:37,154 --> 01:13:37,222
You

1343
01:13:44,911 --> 01:13:49,700
hope that basically the client needs to change

1344
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:51,996
the word, uhm,

1345
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:55,745
but in great sense. You know, and we'll get over to your change orders

1346
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:57,950
and tag it to this my line, you know,

1347
01:13:57,951 --> 01:14:00,382
give this a lot of money based off of that new change.

1348
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:04,903
Thank you much. I'm going to request that this is really the

1349
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:10,522
most pleasure that should be on. Oh. Is

1350
01:14:10,523 --> 01:14:13,724
there a place you want to change or is the proof going here and

1351
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,271
say, yes, the proof has much money. Yeah,

1352
01:14:16,272 --> 01:14:18,576
can I mail or I'll show you something? Yeah,

1353
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:21,420
so there's, uh, can you go do that?

1354
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:23,768
Can you, uh, add your physical change over request?

1355
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:26,251
Thank you Peace. Peace.

1356
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:29,044
That's why this, uh, is, uh, it's great.

1357
01:14:29,045 --> 01:14:34,285
Yeah. Nice going.

1358
01:14:34,286 --> 01:14:36,554
. . Let's go inside and watch him move on the chain. I'm going

1359
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,097
to encourage you to go on the chain before. Thank you very much.

1360
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:44,712
Now we're about to change our orders,

1361
01:14:44,737 --> 01:14:47,399
and each one needs to see an answer today,

1362
01:14:47,563 --> 01:14:49,981
see from today. Let's answer people. It wasn't approved.

1363
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:54,567
You leave me- It was approved.

1364
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:56,705
You don't change it to the contract,

1365
01:14:56,706 --> 01:14:57,008
right? You you're out there, and you've had to get it to the- would

1366
01:14:57,009 --> 01:15:00,757
you ever change your order? You Or would you ever allow that love and

1367
01:15:00,758 --> 01:15:03,406
scared of a value, so that it's- where would you be able to change

1368
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,859
people's dollars? Right there.

1369
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,164
We'll in the next changeable cost. What is this for?

1370
01:15:09,165 --> 01:15:11,190
I think we should do change people whatever you want.

1371
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:14,357
Alright, Steve. Okay. We'll type one up and rally.

1372
01:15:14,358 --> 01:15:16,373
Bye Okay, we'll just do our track later.

1373
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,529
Yeah, and it must be a little bit simpler.

1374
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:26,476
Bye. You

1375
01:15:26,477 --> 01:15:30,507
can think of it. Never stop by the university.

1376
01:15:30,508 --> 01:15:36,200
to you.

1377
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:38,616
J-Mylover, so that helped them succeed.

1378
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good,

1379
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:49,508
This would be great, but it wasn't bangers.

1380
01:15:49,953 --> 01:15:53,568
See, there's nothing going on here. Is this a push to the system,

1381
01:15:53,587 --> 01:15:56,716
or is it manual? You know what this is. It's manual to listen.

1382
01:15:57,368 --> 01:15:59,627
If you guys can push this video more,

1383
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,888
really, it will be about, I have,

1384
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:04,707
I guess. And, um,

1385
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:08,191
Portland, that is literally a half mile away from,

1386
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:10,956
uh, Umm, Umm, Christmas. Thank you.

1387
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:14,028
And, I knew this guy on the side.

1388
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:16,286
I went out there about two, but it must get out of here.

1389
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,931
Six years of heavy, they were talking about- So,

1390
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:22,141
You know, they said duration, and they got the purchase orders,

1391
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:25,163
and the receipts, and the inventory transactions,

1392
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,794
and the elective, their fulfillment decision. If you, And they've been saying a lot

1393
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:31,913
crazy about looking at this great integration. We have two months to get on

1394
01:16:31,914 --> 01:16:34,739
out there, like that is. You've been, you've been talking about this,

1395
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,538
didn't you? The integration, you've blown it out and say it's all great.

1396
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:41,218
They've been, they hardly does anything. There's so much that can be integrated here,

1397
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:43,516
but where are you gonna do it? Thank you. . There's,

1398
01:16:43,597 --> 01:16:45,634
I haven't taken you anywhere you want it to.

1399
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:48,522
Nobody's written the characters. Mhm.

1400
01:16:48,523 --> 01:16:51,031
No, son. Ah, ah, it's serious.

1401
01:16:51,032 --> 01:16:54,333
Mhm. Mhm.

1402
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:56,603
Mhm.

1403
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:02,252
Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.

1404
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:08,480
Mhm. Mhm.

1405
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:15,091
I'm sure.

1406
01:17:15,092 --> 01:17:18,412
We've never finished up with the chamfer.

1407
01:17:18,413 --> 01:17:23,136
Mhm. I'm going to turn it into a,

1408
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:27,199
All of them. I see how busy she is. This is where a lot

1409
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:31,016
of companies have messed up in this video.

1410
01:17:31,017 --> 01:17:35,036
You this is a function of the investment because a lot of companies are

1411
01:17:35,037 --> 01:17:37,515
only in business, plus the partners,

1412
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:39,631
the best of either U.S. or anything. If you're,

1413
01:17:39,632 --> 01:17:44,560
if you're against some companies and they will abide in

1414
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:47,256
a project management business.

1415
01:17:47,257 --> 01:17:50,056
. . . . . which is really how we root this.

1416
01:17:50,086 --> 01:17:54,624
It's weird because the downside of this is this payroll line that

1417
01:17:54,625 --> 01:18:00,271
I can prevent. I just need to be tracking the job,

1418
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:03,336
which is why,

1419
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:05,431
it sounds like, I mean,

1420
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:07,937
there's one that doesn't work out in somewhere.

1421
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:11,163
Okay, it's tons of editing there.

1422
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:13,940
you Okay, I'm gonna talk to you this morning. He is doing this in

1423
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:16,525
history. He is in Vietnam.

1424
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:18,861
He ain't f****** it. So he is in history.

1425
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:21,249
Yeah. And I hear him still sitting.

1426
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:26,196
Fortunately, my father began checking to give you a last name to every

1427
01:18:26,818 --> 01:18:28,890
chop chop. Come on. Yeah,

1428
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:33,733
so I was happy. I asked Chuck,

1429
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:35,191
and I said, well, he doesn't use the template at all, and he's a

1430
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:37,554
beautiful guy. We're going to use him to this. So he does all of

1431
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:41,766
it, whatever he does, but he manages to use it this year,

1432
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:45,877
but in this way, yeah. Probably it's sense that there are many of this,

1433
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:50,136
because we gotta take this and get me this thumbnail there.

1434
01:18:50,137 --> 01:18:52,771
Yeah, so I'm basically- See you Thanks for the good of this one.

1435
01:18:52,845 --> 01:18:55,074
This is great joke for you, but I don't like this one.

1436
01:18:55,905 --> 01:19:00,548
Two PMs that are involved are molecules here and co- so they can mark

1437
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,846
or shop, that's the goal. They work in tech,

1438
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:07,052
uh, kind of stay out of this stuff.

1439
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:12,470
Yeah. It's great. It's the host week. We're requiring our field crews to put

1440
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:14,955
their time into field management.

1441
01:19:14,956 --> 01:19:18,333
Uh. Well, They should be,

1442
01:19:18,444 --> 01:19:21,294
should be tracked in business.

1443
01:19:21,295 --> 01:19:26,828
So you should have, you're not on- Bye You should have a report

1444
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:29,422
that shows pending. So there's some,

1445
01:19:29,673 --> 01:19:31,776
I don't think this is gonna be you, I think.

1446
01:19:31,777 --> 01:19:34,394
. . . . distance utilized, uh,

1447
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:37,369
of less humidity like that, uuuh,

1448
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:39,007
is . . . . . . . . . . Thanks for watching

1449
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:41,021
and I'll see you guys later.

1450
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:44,232
Thank you. Thank you.

1451
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,856
Thank you.

1452
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:51,807
Thank you.

1453
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:59,976
Anything else sucks? What do you think?

1454
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:03,931
If you leave, I don't know how to,

1455
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:09,014
I don't know where just the people are. If you need somebody to help

1456
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,082
with that, like a consultant,

1457
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:15,410
there's a link. you need that where Ian Baseview is out there by that

1458
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,355
I'm never called up. And she's kind of a semi-retired.

1459
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,417
Bye! But Baseview was the, umm, was the,

1460
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,051
the child that technically- Definitely.

1461
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:30,593
He used for Vista and,

1462
01:20:30,922 --> 01:20:33,290
and, uh, and Technica.

1463
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:35,735
And so she very used Vista really well.

1464
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:39,392
She does. . I'm not quite as well,

1465
01:20:39,456 --> 01:20:42,586
but, uhm, she lives in Vista River. So she's helped a lot of my

1466
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:47,302
clients transition. transition with the Vista to help them get

1467
01:20:47,303 --> 01:20:50,961
the two working together and she really loves it.

1468
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:56,452
Let's go. You know, you might need to be a survivor.

1469
01:20:56,453 --> 01:20:58,757
Trust is pretty good, but it's just,

1470
01:20:58,806 --> 01:21:02,706
like, we have so- much going on and they should pull out the fire

1471
01:21:02,707 --> 01:21:07,184
and work out these. Yeah. So a lot of our experts in those areas

1472
01:21:07,185 --> 01:21:10,687
are just trash. Thank you much. Yeah. So we're gonna try and do our

1473
01:21:10,688 --> 01:21:13,097
own shit on the side. It's there. Give me that sort of thing.

1474
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:17,507
Thank Okay.

1475
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:21,825
This is a good tool for, uh,

1476
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,027
this one, this is my tool for it.

1477
01:21:24,028 --> 01:21:26,639
Thank you. I love this one, I don't know,

1478
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,376
but it works well. So, yeah, it's been tracking.

1479
01:21:29,736 --> 01:21:32,691
It's been really easy to erase it. We'll read these through my- I have

1480
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:34,968
a pain from this. I mean,

1481
01:21:35,873 --> 01:21:39,520
technically, you have the- she's barking and saying,

1482
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,593
you know, if she has- she's doing a different area.

1483
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:47,351
She's doing, uh, I don't want a third area in the house because- Thank

1484
01:21:47,848 --> 01:21:51,047
very much. Here, and then also,

1485
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:53,654
she's doing the best of it. And it's the idea,

1486
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:56,075
so it would be done in a third area as well.

1487
01:21:56,076 --> 01:21:59,306
So but But, you know, if you've got a deal with what to do

1488
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:02,670
with this, this is a very cool video. It's very simple in the site.

1489
01:22:02,894 --> 01:22:05,961
So you can actually point out, please. You can use a particular site,

1490
01:22:05,969 --> 01:22:10,977
even though you don't have the performance that she has all the numbers in

1491
01:22:10,978 --> 01:22:14,735
her. Which is kind of a, Oh, I'm over-working with,

1492
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:17,497
um, at least the projects that me and Mark are working on.

1493
01:22:17,498 --> 01:22:19,991
Yeah, I can vlog all the chambers in here.

1494
01:22:20,356 --> 01:22:22,967
And, And it's pulling in the original contract value,

1495
01:22:22,968 --> 01:22:27,142
and he could never run in. Um, and this is our percent complete and

1496
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:29,799
this is what I had this past month. We're not going to be doing

1497
01:22:30,115 --> 01:22:34,713
anything. Sometimes we're going to get a new part of your contract value,

1498
01:22:34,714 --> 01:22:37,155
and we're going to get a later point of the thi- We're sending a

1499
01:22:37,156 --> 01:22:39,852
couple bills with it. Oh god, that changed my name.

1500
01:22:39,853 --> 01:22:42,939
I might see it like this, this, this. I'll see you through the breakdown.

1501
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:47,125
Something can you go in last night's? Yeah. Yeah. You can't even have to

1502
01:22:47,126 --> 01:22:50,627
see how the enforcement is already in the agency,

1503
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:54,498
but it can't be possible. Well, uh. you You can also look like,

1504
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:57,292
um, you know,

1505
01:22:57,293 --> 01:22:59,472
we do too.

1506
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:01,813
Thank you. So, the M was,

1507
01:23:01,814 --> 01:23:04,711
uh, and so, uh, the M was one of the three.

1508
01:23:04,865 --> 01:23:07,281
And then, like, okay, that's number one,

1509
01:23:07,424 --> 01:23:10,232
the other. Thank you. I don't even know where I've been paying this,

1510
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:12,300
right? Yeah. Right. I mean, we thank you very much. Yeah,

1511
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:14,667
so they have a lot of names, right? So, they have a lot lot

1512
01:23:14,668 --> 01:23:17,898
of right? right? You have to get that,

1513
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:20,335
they have number one. Examine it,

1514
01:23:20,336 --> 01:23:23,310
yeah. We should have a triple about that. Here's where I'll sew.

1515
01:23:23,311 --> 01:23:26,542
Um, but yeah, you- . Yeah.

1516
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:31,796
Yeah, three months

1517
01:23:31,797 --> 01:23:35,123
in. We'll you in the next and then I'll pay for 90 days.

1518
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:39,347
Would they be less than an emotional one? You have to go back in

1519
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,635
my flat, which affects two and three. you Yeah.

1520
01:23:42,337 --> 01:23:45,453
Yeah. Me too, me too. Me too. Yeah.

1521
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:49,056
So, uhm, awesome. See you.

1522
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,743
I heard it. I heard it from the Strawberry Stones.

1523
01:23:52,245 --> 01:23:54,334
Yes, it's been actually been helpful to do it.

1524
01:23:55,305 --> 01:23:58,584
But, maybe it's a little new. You think we're going to continue to do

1525
01:23:58,585 --> 01:24:00,892
this in a minute. Okay. Well,

1526
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:04,422
we present MediRoute in the shop leading to MediRoute.

1527
01:24:04,423 --> 01:24:07,903
So, uhm. you look at it, and uhm.

1528
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:10,908
I don't like Jira's, like, this is the only use method.

1529
01:24:11,488 --> 01:24:13,544
I honestly like that. Bye. Okay.

1530
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:18,278
I think it's better to shop. Okay, so that's been the final.

1531
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:22,160
So then the other, I love And Bitbucket,

1532
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:24,578
send it. Or you think they're gonna have it.

1533
01:24:24,795 --> 01:24:26,889
I'm gonna start with several people. Man,

1534
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,026
if they're not in the shop, you know, at this facility. So, thanks for

1535
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:33,495
your time. Okay, eventually to the point here.

1536
01:24:33,496 --> 01:24:37,180
I'll see you guys in next video.

1537
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:41,043
Bye P.M. over the shop and the field buildings.

1538
01:24:41,162 --> 01:24:44,291
Eventually that has to be separated and it has to be.

1539
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:47,287
You just to work right.

1540
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:51,316
Then yeah, we can move on to the table.

1541
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:54,096
Good evening. I've been along with you. Yeah.

1542
01:24:54,097 --> 01:24:56,996
So, deep man, there's over there. Are you going to run,

1543
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,132
this is your type of thing or not? Probably not.

1544
01:25:00,133 --> 01:25:02,721
They're going to stay in place. What do you have? You need such a

1545
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,211
waste and they don't have shops like ours in the bottom,

1546
01:25:05,212 --> 01:25:08,570
so they come here in the next week. It's completely different.

1547
01:25:08,612 --> 01:25:11,144
I'm not very used to it. Umm,

1548
01:25:11,155 --> 01:25:13,896
all of their shops are ran in my field personnel,

1549
01:25:13,997 --> 01:25:17,079
so the field people come in and they use the shops and the tax

1550
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,188
shops are much good. Every time that they take,

1551
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:21,838
uh, stop, like, really want to do it,

1552
01:25:21,918 --> 01:25:24,430
like, set, you know, operator,

1553
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:27,958
do what it is that it, you know. Bye! I'm talking about PM Uncheck.

1554
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:31,333
You think of Lauren, he'll just do his wisdom.

1555
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:34,116
No, because, uhm, we're going to cast,

1556
01:25:34,117 --> 01:25:36,497
They're doing these, and they pushed that,

1557
01:25:36,732 --> 01:25:38,808
pushed that on us. So in fact, they came here,

1558
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,216
and we have tech already in place.

1559
01:25:41,217 --> 01:25:43,354
is and they said,

1560
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,402
oh, it's unique for this operation,

1561
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:47,566
but everything else runs out of 10 years.

1562
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:51,013
We'll in the next and haven't been,

1563
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:55,426
you know, so it's like, okay, the world is moving very quickly to OS

1564
01:25:55,427 --> 01:25:57,684
7, uh, offshore side,

1565
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,501
you know. Yeah. All of these, these are new ones. Think of a long

1566
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:02,548
one, sure. We will be doing it in tech,

1567
01:26:02,549 --> 01:26:06,407
no. I'm happy have a great And little bit No.

1568
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:10,715
This is going to do what I have in the rest of the moment.

1569
01:26:11,223 --> 01:26:13,648
Okay. Let's see if we'll finish with us now. Let's go.

1570
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,077
Yeah. Okay. Estimating teams,

1571
01:26:17,078 --> 01:26:19,096
since you guys are here on the call today,

1572
01:26:19,097 --> 01:26:21,786
uhm, considering that you guys might proceed.

1573
01:26:21,787 --> 01:26:24,286
See you. If you have any basic questions on it,

1574
01:26:24,287 --> 01:26:27,814
we can potentially be hungry. And all of a sudden,

1575
01:26:27,902 --> 01:26:32,058
you're this right. So give everybody Very

1576
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,359
Thank you very

1577
01:26:48,091 --> 01:26:51,540
Not, uh, they cut off for a second as I switched the mics over

1578
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:54,521
to the game. So I'm gonna say,

1579
01:26:54,522 --> 01:26:57,926
uh, what's on the sh- mics go-z first time,

1580
01:26:57,927 --> 01:27:01,527
6th all over the deal. Just like first of all,

1581
01:27:01,528 --> 01:27:05,979
eh? Umm, u- kill it, hmm. Like the sizes that are not in the

1582
01:27:05,985 --> 01:27:08,080
database that we push labor against them,

1583
01:27:08,096 --> 01:27:10,173
or are you talking about labor code?

1584
01:27:10,174 --> 01:27:13,472
Go. No,

1585
01:27:13,473 --> 01:27:15,592
certainly a size that, uh,

1586
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:18,304
update, I guess, to create this thing,

1587
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:21,096
fix your room, house for work. That's all I got.

1588
01:27:21,097 --> 01:27:24,588
I don't know what to do,

1589
01:27:24,589 --> 01:27:27,377
but, uh, it's not going to be something.

1590
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:31,869
That's all I got. As far as cheap as I was painting.

1591
01:27:31,965 --> 01:27:35,640
I'm just going to you some of the, uh, uh,

1592
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:40,066
nations where you can be. Hello? Okay.

1593
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:42,554
So, I have to throw up it.

1594
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:45,120
It's been a great time. It's what it was. No passes. I'll see you

1595
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:47,702
It's not ending. It's still in process.

1596
01:27:47,703 --> 01:27:51,022
Now it's not so, uh, I'm supposed to follow on you guys as well.

1597
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:53,301
I hope you guys are supposed to be updating some of this. Uh,

1598
01:27:53,312 --> 01:27:58,068
but I guess there hasn't been a clear

1599
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:01,171
communication between who has time and who doesn't.

1600
01:28:01,172 --> 01:28:05,697
But, uhm, I'm assuming you're talking about

1601
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:08,053
the stainless sizes, uh,

1602
01:28:08,064 --> 01:28:13,141
considering. I'm ready. Some of these stainless sizes that

1603
01:28:13,142 --> 01:28:16,071
we have in here have zero dimensions in them.

1604
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:19,664
soon. So,

1605
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:22,413
no, we haven't met with all of those folks.

1606
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:26,647
As of yet, and I'm not anything that- is defined in here,

1607
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:31,084
has a group pushed against it in the last few days,

1608
01:28:31,085 --> 01:28:35,702
uhh, with some- the metrics have been made since I had adjustments too.

1609
01:28:35,825 --> 01:28:38,781
Just keep it gone to the light where we pushed against it,

1610
01:28:38,782 --> 01:28:41,191
what will be the same as carbon. Yes.

1611
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:45,228
Okay, grabbing for those, same as the right now,

1612
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:48,105
since we are not having all the size of it.

1613
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:51,415
Can you turn both? This off, so we don't get,

1614
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:54,726
like, missed. Uh,

1615
01:28:54,737 --> 01:28:56,991
to, like, what if not, look at this piece,

1616
01:28:57,228 --> 01:28:58,171
so it's, like, and.

1617
01:29:03,065 --> 01:29:06,151
Yeah,

1618
01:29:03,065 --> 01:29:06,151
Yeah.

1619
01:29:06,152 --> 01:29:09,240
Any dimensions broke out in here. Uh,

1620
01:29:09,251 --> 01:29:12,634
so, for right now, these ones aren't active,

1621
01:29:12,635 --> 01:29:14,665
it is so beautiful. Yeah,

1622
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:20,294
I think that's when it's in the big panic.

1623
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:27,429
I hear brother, but he deleted the brain distancing

1624
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,156
brain from all the beings in the place. Stay safe.

1625
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,294
Yeah, and then, yeah, also,

1626
01:29:32,752 --> 01:29:37,316
and I know that that's the first, and he started creating one right now,

1627
01:29:37,317 --> 01:29:39,650
we're missing that. You So, I mean,

1628
01:29:39,651 --> 01:29:43,741
I think really, just to finish everything on this now,

1629
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:45,942
this campaign, and to leave it pretty clear.

1630
01:29:45,943 --> 01:29:50,203
You Yeah, and the biggest issue with this having it in the,

1631
01:29:50,204 --> 01:29:54,060
in the carbon size, and having just the seamless grade cloth.

1632
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,379
well. my house is, uhm,

1633
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,441
it's not being populated as,

1634
01:29:58,605 --> 01:30:02,191
as the carbon, uhm, yeah. We gotta leave.

1635
01:30:02,192 --> 01:30:04,302
It's not even differentiating over what,

1636
01:30:04,341 --> 01:30:08,343
but that's having a different shade. We can push it through labor against that

1637
01:30:08,344 --> 01:30:12,001
shade of time. And. You can keep carbon on one,

1638
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,865
on one plane to keep the stain with the objectives on another.

1639
01:30:15,866 --> 01:30:18,211
Uh, so, if this is something- I love this.

1640
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,890
I'm putting that block of you guys down because we're gonna have your presence

1641
01:30:20,891 --> 01:30:23,612
on us so that we can get these sizes defined in here.

1642
01:30:23,613 --> 01:30:26,191
Umm, there's some time studies that I have.

1643
01:30:26,192 --> 01:30:28,835
So, with the time studies,

1644
01:30:28,836 --> 01:30:33,324
umm, we can do some time studies for some stainless material and see umm.

1645
01:30:33,335 --> 01:30:38,178
on. with the contamination reduction and changing

1646
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:41,779
equipment and consumables for what's needed for the stuff.

1647
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,480
Thank you very much. Uh,

1648
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:47,873
I get back to that in my time studies and we'll kick some of

1649
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,132
them later or push against those so that we can have that.

1650
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:52,258
You uh, for the future. So,

1651
01:30:52,409 --> 01:30:57,063
but right now, even pretty much has to be had as carbon and

1652
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:58,228
bad age. . . . . . . . . . . . .

1653
01:30:58,229 --> 01:31:00,100
. . blood, really for the

1654
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:08,894
some aim. But though,

1655
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:11,581
once we had it in there, we did push it on me.

1656
01:31:11,653 --> 01:31:14,011
Well, um, he did it all the time.

1657
01:31:14,012 --> 01:31:16,520
you Yeah, if you push the time over there,

1658
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:18,715
you wouldn't be the carbon gun. I mean,

1659
01:31:18,716 --> 01:31:21,490
you could be your entity if you just get over there and say,

1660
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:24,143
well, I love it. I'm not a repumption or whatever for that.

1661
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:27,167
I think it's done so at least. Yep. I know you can do it.

1662
01:31:27,576 --> 01:31:30,211
If you might work with me here for a,

1663
01:31:30,212 --> 01:31:33,269
Well, it's a whittle.

1664
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,035
So, uh, it's my dashboard and it's a fair one,

1665
01:31:37,036 --> 01:31:40,643
eh? Okay. All is it. And you'll get the funding to create some of

1666
01:31:40,644 --> 01:31:43,029
the estimated. So,

1667
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,088
do it up to the world manual,

1668
01:31:45,275 --> 01:31:48,571
let's ask. Yes. Yeah, and point to all of those.

1669
01:31:48,827 --> 01:31:52,580
And, uh, I think the guys get better than that.

1670
01:31:53,477 --> 01:31:55,586
Most of the well. Let's go. Yeah,

1671
01:31:55,587 --> 01:31:58,548
I think they're not different for Phillips. We're going to have to get up

1672
01:31:58,549 --> 01:32:02,149
with us. But, you know, it's because you've got a background and you've got

1673
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:07,006
a. Yeah, it's. Sure. Well, that's a good.

1674
01:32:07,007 --> 01:32:11,330
Uh. Okay.

1675
01:32:11,616 --> 01:32:14,186
Yeah. No, that's, uh, that's a good one.

1676
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:16,566
And, uh, I made up that. So,

1677
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:19,211
that's something we can, we can put it. And,

1678
01:32:19,212 --> 01:32:21,323
uh, we can, uh,

1679
01:32:21,324 --> 01:32:26,251
it as an action rate. Thank you.

1680
01:32:26,252 --> 01:32:28,733
In the, uh, in the upcoming future here.

1681
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:33,603
So, uh, beyond the shapes and the statements.

1682
01:32:33,604 --> 01:32:35,718
It was. Umm, labor, portion.

1683
01:32:35,719 --> 01:32:39,195
Uh, is there anything additional amazing guys have?

1684
01:32:39,273 --> 01:32:41,306
Or anything that you guys wanted to see?

1685
01:32:41,307 --> 01:32:45,811
See you. Now I'm

1686
01:32:45,812 --> 01:32:50,311
getting started. Okay, okay. See you in the next video.

1687
01:32:50,312 --> 01:32:52,346
You can find some of those,

1688
01:32:52,347 --> 01:32:55,685
uh, flavors, but, uhm, the games are like,

1689
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:58,291
you know, we've got a series. See ya.

1690
01:32:58,292 --> 01:33:00,903
You know what I'm gonna question,

1691
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:03,249
okay? When I, uh, over,

1692
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,355
was that someone was like, can you get here?

1693
01:33:05,356 --> 01:33:10,230
Yes. Thank you. So I saw the light,

1694
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:13,075
like, someone was like, oh, this is all for,

1695
01:33:13,076 --> 01:33:15,477
uh, you know. It's not a bad idea,

1696
01:33:15,478 --> 01:33:19,390
it's not a bad If we can handle that,

1697
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:22,291
I will do that. I'll do that. action that I call for.

1698
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,871
OpsGenie, yeah, I mean,

1699
01:33:24,872 --> 01:33:27,110
this one is like this, but,

1700
01:33:27,111 --> 01:33:31,812
uhh, it's not. You know what I was just

1701
01:33:31,813 --> 01:33:34,262
going to touch on some of this extra,

1702
01:33:34,263 --> 01:33:37,589
uhh, work that we can have at the end.

1703
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,637
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You know what I mean?

1704
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:42,922
Put Paris to her side of the world, on the actual end of the

1705
01:33:42,923 --> 01:33:45,951
world. And you can say that that's the answers.

1706
01:33:45,952 --> 01:33:50,580
issues. I don't want to be

1707
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:54,331
honest with you. Okay. So far.

1708
01:33:54,332 --> 01:33:56,941
If you just, just put sort of those,

1709
01:33:56,942 --> 01:34:00,217
uh, if asking, I think, for other action.

1710
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:02,311
There's a little,

1711
01:34:02,312 --> 01:34:04,662
This is like, uh, I didn't listen to some of this.

1712
01:34:04,663 --> 01:34:07,024
I'm not seeing your phone, putting your phone in son. Kevin P.

1713
01:34:07,025 --> 01:34:10,356
has a video. You just gotta get a bunch of little cuts in there.

1714
01:34:10,357 --> 01:34:14,105
. . Yeah. . . Is that about having all the numbers of the

1715
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:16,187
cuts? . It's turning on. .

1716
01:34:16,188 --> 01:34:20,602
. . It's in the view. . So I don't know,

1717
01:34:20,603 --> 01:34:22,652
um, close, close and break your .

1718
01:34:22,653 --> 01:34:24,913
. . So . . there's .

1719
01:34:24,914 --> 01:34:27,107
. . there's time to go through So .

1720
01:34:27,108 --> 01:34:29,710
. . the you're so near .

1721
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:32,838
. . and then . . . and open up to this part summary,

1722
01:34:32,839 --> 01:34:37,443
uhh. you see that we have cuts not being here

1723
01:34:37,444 --> 01:34:39,990
for coats. Now .

1724
01:34:39,991 --> 01:34:44,015
. . this might be On the later side .

1725
01:34:44,016 --> 01:34:46,812
. . point more than not much for two coats.

1726
01:34:46,813 --> 01:34:49,460
Um, so we can . . . we can make adjustments,

1727
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:52,480
make that little bit more . . uhh,

1728
01:34:52,491 --> 01:34:55,208
but there is already that whole chain .

1729
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:59,511
. . in there . . . as for the we can .

1730
01:34:59,512 --> 01:35:02,931
. . is that what you are saying .

1731
01:35:02,932 --> 01:35:05,139
. the timing quote . . .

1732
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:09,694
so the value of the chain is that something we

1733
01:35:09,774 --> 01:35:12,619
can . . . something we can .

1734
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,135
. that's I will say, if you request this Sighing .

1735
01:35:17,136 --> 01:35:20,436
. . in a front end .

1736
01:35:20,437 --> 01:35:22,792
. . separate . . . umm,

1737
01:35:22,814 --> 01:35:25,068
working . . . like shit I .

1738
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:27,154
. . so .

1739
01:35:27,155 --> 01:35:30,347
. I wonder if he wants that. So he's saying,

1740
01:35:30,348 --> 01:35:33,531
essentially, if he has a plate that has nachos in it,

1741
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:36,923
obviously. Yeah, we remember there was more,

1742
01:35:36,924 --> 01:35:39,442
I think, yeah, they're trying to accomplish a time,

1743
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,702
uh, the- I think we need to go ahead with things,

1744
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:45,594
uhh, so it's- so people go to the end of the scope.

1745
01:35:45,595 --> 01:35:48,047
Yeah, we have to do that, and it turns out to happen if it's

1746
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,381
not- I'm sure how it is, but, you know,

1747
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:55,431
typically- so they're gonna be the scope of the width of the flange,

1748
01:35:55,813 --> 01:35:58,858
and it's- I mean, 4-H is in a way that because it doesn't really

1749
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:00,996
know how deep it's going, okay? Uh,

1750
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:03,605
that's right. So, I've been just as 4-H's.

1751
01:36:03,606 --> 01:36:06,638
So- I'm playing, you don't get 4-H's.

1752
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,285
I don't want to remember what it does for the other shot.

1753
01:36:10,303 --> 01:36:12,437
I don't know if I don't make a witness that dry. Bye. But,

1754
01:36:12,776 --> 01:36:15,816
yeah, a lot of people can just put a notch in ignoring for about

1755
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:23,296
such a few candidates. Small notch. Thank you very You

1756
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:26,235
should be able to challenge her, okay? You put it in as a fight.

1757
01:36:28,067 --> 01:36:30,308
Very good. We'll just- Yeah, two inches and two inches,

1758
01:36:30,309 --> 01:36:34,935
so you basically get four inches, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no If

1759
01:36:34,936 --> 01:36:37,420
I've got any thicker notch out than that, then I, I don't have to

1760
01:36:37,421 --> 01:36:39,772
be okay. Or, a lot of people say,

1761
01:36:39,802 --> 01:36:42,204
cool. I mean, two inches, I mean, So,

1762
01:36:42,371 --> 01:36:44,623
something used to make one is a cool little one,

1763
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:46,802
cool. You know, the truth is pressing big beside that.

1764
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:53,644
Whatever works in it. Yeah. Thank you. If,

1765
01:36:53,645 --> 01:36:58,328
if, if anything that you're having something manual for,

1766
01:36:58,801 --> 01:37:02,221
I'll be by, okay. There's no- I can't be kind of like that.

1767
01:37:02,351 --> 01:37:05,411
He said, just encourage them,

1768
01:37:05,412 --> 01:37:08,716
and if they don't manually put it, go ahead and do it,

1769
01:37:08,717 --> 01:37:12,607
or maybe- really, really burning, or the million hours in the hours for peace.

1770
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,326
That's opportunities for,

1771
01:37:15,328 --> 01:37:17,273
and I think that's what they were saying. I love you. I love that.

1772
01:37:17,274 --> 01:37:21,810
That's opportunities to change stuff. They just need to keep trying to

1773
01:37:21,811 --> 01:37:24,871
what they're doing. And then, let's go make changes.

1774
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:29,403
and so on. Yeah, in one thing you guys can

1775
01:37:29,404 --> 01:37:32,761
do to help us on the estimated side.

1776
01:37:32,762 --> 01:37:36,622
Bye. It is, um, if there's estimates you guys are looking at it and

1777
01:37:36,623 --> 01:37:39,868
you've noticed there's a lot of, umm,

1778
01:37:39,879 --> 01:37:43,211
there's something reoccurring that. . . It comes up quite a bit that you

1779
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:45,531
can potentially have to have some extras.

1780
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:47,919
Umm, I know we have camera in there.

1781
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,336
Umm, it can be- I they look in one- one extras,

1782
01:37:51,337 --> 01:37:53,995
yeah. I bet they can. It's possible. Umm,

1783
01:37:54,005 --> 01:37:57,640
slow. So,

1784
01:37:57,842 --> 01:38:00,434
right now, we're being adjusted.

1785
01:38:00,435 --> 01:38:04,840
I have to do.

1786
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,315
No. Last time we didn't defect the training.

1787
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:09,828
So, not alone. It's active.

1788
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:13,356
So, right now, it's going to,

1789
01:38:13,357 --> 01:38:15,537
default and,

1790
01:38:15,538 --> 01:38:18,128
uhm,

1791
01:38:18,138 --> 01:38:22,289
which, even, uhm, I love it. Thank you for yeah,

1792
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:25,896
five hours, uhm, I going to go up for two-teens,

1793
01:38:25,897 --> 01:38:28,066
let's just stand up on the river. So,

1794
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:33,134
let's see if we have- You see how long they are,

1795
01:38:33,255 --> 01:38:35,925
so you guys don't stay as much.

1796
01:38:35,926 --> 01:38:39,230
Uh. Bye! No, just don't bend that kind of work.

1797
01:38:40,691 --> 01:38:45,511
You can take your ADSS and show it on your ADSS.

1798
01:38:45,512 --> 01:38:48,845
But,

1799
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:51,061
essentially, that one would be,

1800
01:38:51,062 --> 01:38:54,036
ah. But,

1801
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:56,558
most pieces of this show are that much enough,

1802
01:38:56,559 --> 01:38:59,730
and again, just be well. Thank you,

1803
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:03,022
Bob and I, again, and. You have additional labor in here,

1804
01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:05,855
cause that's going to be a lot more standard. And he's like,

1805
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,599
oh, I'm going to step in.

1806
01:39:12,281 --> 01:39:15,096
Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. I think you're an expert.

1807
01:39:15,097 --> 01:39:17,350
I'd like to read you Thank you.

1808
01:39:17,671 --> 01:39:19,798
Okay, well, now I'm just going to draw a few quotes to say to

1809
01:39:19,799 --> 01:39:22,388
everyone. Yeah. But L-A-P-E-S-S,

1810
01:39:22,636 --> 01:39:24,724
most people do that as an estimate actually.

1811
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:26,939
Yeah. Well, I'll let it, There are not a lot of pieces.

1812
01:39:27,382 --> 01:39:30,664
That's also a fact that I put it somewhere. Yeah,

1813
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:33,751
so that's, that's what we can, we can look at adding,

1814
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:36,182
We can talk about some extras of,

1815
01:39:36,183 --> 01:39:40,724
uh, essentially additional labor

1816
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,740
to add to me. Each one of them,

1817
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:47,591
uhm, is the other way I would look at it and it's going

1818
01:39:47,592 --> 01:39:49,831
to your asking summary and,

1819
01:39:49,832 --> 01:39:53,514
It's going to your task today.

1820
01:39:53,686 --> 01:39:56,410
Later details, going to your wellness.

1821
01:39:56,411 --> 01:40:00,982
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Yeah, there's adding a certain percentage

1822
01:40:00,997 --> 01:40:03,799
to the wellness that you have in there.

1823
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,953
Um, Yeah,

1824
01:40:05,954 --> 01:40:09,291
you can get into manual overrides enemies.

1825
01:40:09,292 --> 01:40:12,874
Well, it's the only thing about doing this here,

1826
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:15,788
and I'm just gonna be, Yeah, you can be manual overrides.

1827
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:19,789
To do that, everybody has to make me change that up.

1828
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,996
Because now, Dave, this introduces an ecosystem.

1829
01:40:21,997 --> 01:40:24,332
Let's see. Once in a while,

1830
01:40:24,565 --> 01:40:28,676
do the bend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're something that isn't very internal circle,

1831
01:40:28,677 --> 01:40:33,411
something you shouldn't use. So like, you're presented to a lot of 10% easily

1832
01:40:33,412 --> 01:40:36,361
with 75%. But I keep wondering,

1833
01:40:36,571 --> 01:40:42,933
why can't you do that? That's it. So

1834
01:40:42,934 --> 01:40:43,514
I got these columns. They're harder than all the rest. I want to put

1835
01:40:43,515 --> 01:40:45,840
them in 65%.

1836
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:48,426
No. The regular is maybe better than that.

1837
01:40:48,605 --> 01:40:51,309
Yeah. Can you do that? Not what I'm gonna do.

1838
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:54,092
See that? See you right there. You should.

1839
01:40:54,093 --> 01:40:58,304
You should meet it, uhm, because if it's additional whaling,

1840
01:40:58,305 --> 01:41:02,191
if it's additional, uhm, uhh.

1841
01:41:02,192 --> 01:41:06,877
And all of the processes for every single piece is in

1842
01:41:06,878 --> 01:41:09,250
the labor case. So, essentially,

1843
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:12,800
I shouldn't have- Yeah. Thank you. But the intent of like,

1844
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:15,349
uhm, you take it like the rails.

1845
01:41:15,637 --> 01:41:17,860
Do you want it a lot of noise for any of that? Sure. Or

1846
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:20,659
do I get it? Yeah. Alright. So, usually on that,

1847
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:24,081
I said, I'll go over there to those stars and the material,

1848
01:41:24,094 --> 01:41:26,311
and I will pop it in and play it. Yeah.

1849
01:41:26,312 --> 01:41:28,513
So, let it back and create a spot.

1850
01:41:28,662 --> 01:41:32,442
So, theoretically, you should really have to go home,

1851
01:41:32,443 --> 01:41:38,745
so you can find some material. You could come

1852
01:41:38,746 --> 01:41:39,802
in here and one off, and he said, I don't know about what that

1853
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:42,456
said right here. Yeah, okay. Okay.

1854
01:41:41,683 --> 01:41:46,385
Okay. Yeah. There was another thing

1855
01:41:46,386 --> 01:41:49,433
I was thinking about being out of preview.

1856
01:41:49,434 --> 01:41:53,389
Thank you. Oh, I can play… there was another free thing,

1857
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,404
and I sent it out. And this time of year,

1858
01:41:56,405 --> 01:41:58,471
there's so much trouble breathing that's going to be a ton.

1859
01:41:58,472 --> 01:42:01,456
I'm going 3D book on it. I'm going to do a 3D in that

1860
01:42:01,457 --> 01:42:04,101
as, as a,

1861
01:42:04,102 --> 01:42:06,228
uh, s in the next year.

1862
01:42:06,229 --> 01:42:10,429
Thank you. Umm, I'll see you're going through the labor case,

1863
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:12,834
which is really about breakfast that you don't think about.

1864
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:17,259
Uhm, I see. I think the labor could answer a lot.

1865
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:20,943
Uhm, those are the two main ways of doing it,

1866
01:42:20,944 --> 01:42:30,600
so it makes sense. . . . . . . .

1867
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:32,651
. I'm doing it multiple different ways.

1868
01:42:32,652 --> 01:42:34,832
So, like, that they are basically,

1869
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:36,965
you don't burn anything out of a souscatcher,

1870
01:42:36,966 --> 01:42:39,125
you can't burn anything but a hea It's,

1871
01:42:39,126 --> 01:42:43,904
uhh, I've done, uhh, I had a radio.

1872
01:42:43,905 --> 01:42:46,711
Thank you.

1873
01:42:46,712 --> 01:42:48,749
A, but then I have an A in for,

1874
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:51,552
with 3D on it. So, uh,

1875
01:42:51,562 --> 01:42:54,463
so that we got the, that's what we're gonna choose that.

1876
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,467
It's- Say anything you want to do? Uh,

1877
01:42:56,478 --> 01:42:58,536
I just like it. I like that. Okay,

1878
01:42:58,537 --> 01:43:01,018
so you get the last kind of winter summer choice.

1879
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:03,915
Yes, yes. Yes. Whereas other,

1880
01:43:04,247 --> 01:43:06,891
other functions like, uh, North or Southern,

1881
01:43:06,892 --> 01:43:09,978
they're just going to say, look, if it's done for each and a half

1882
01:43:09,979 --> 01:43:12,965
or so and more, be, You know, they're making a mark.

1883
01:43:13,505 --> 01:43:16,253
They're also pretty nice, and they just take it into the native.

1884
01:43:16,254 --> 01:43:18,876
They send a new cut up using their ass. Thank Thank you.

1885
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:21,163
Yeah, I'm saying one of them.

1886
01:43:21,164 --> 01:43:24,192
She's out. I think I have a few little stuff in there so I

1887
01:43:24,193 --> 01:43:26,911
can do another one. Yeah. And then,

1888
01:43:26,912 --> 01:43:30,090
Can't screw up. There's another way to do whatever you guys want.

1889
01:43:30,278 --> 01:43:33,303
But, I'm kind of wanting to, I'm gonna better get into that.

1890
01:43:33,304 --> 01:43:35,680
I got it. I got it. it. I got it.

1891
01:43:35,906 --> 01:43:39,124
I it. I got it. I got it. I and not every piece.

1892
01:43:39,329 --> 01:43:42,164
I do like to make sure that they require us to do this,

1893
01:43:42,165 --> 01:43:45,955
but that's true. That's a multiple, multiple types of how they can do something

1894
01:43:45,956 --> 01:43:49,714
down so they can pick that up. And you can still roll when you

1895
01:43:49,715 --> 01:43:54,208
have the rest of it, actually. . I don't think it's gonna be a

1896
01:43:54,209 --> 01:43:59,208
Okay.

1897
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:06,881
Yeah, that's another thing I can do sometimes.

1898
01:44:06,882 --> 01:44:08,934
I'm sorry. My studies are, um, yeah, uhm,

1899
01:44:08,945 --> 01:44:11,877
ehm, ehm,

1900
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:17,326
ehm, ehm, Thank you. It is a little

1901
01:44:17,327 --> 01:44:21,954
bit more difficult, though. It's a bonded extrapolation factor that really wants

1902
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:24,102
well and free. Really? Regardless,

1903
01:44:24,103 --> 01:44:27,125
it depends on things sort of play that are with and the length of

1904
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:30,671
the play as well. I'm usually going to just go for a wait.

1905
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:34,845
as you can see. It's the best in making sure of everything.

1906
01:44:34,846 --> 01:44:39,271
Umm, you can look at the sort of photoshop.

1907
01:44:39,272 --> 01:44:41,329
That really doesn't really tell you,

1908
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:44,090
uh, it doesn't tell you a whole story,

1909
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:46,170
because it depends on the things, uh,

1910
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:49,241
yeah, ah. What do you think? Just,

1911
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:52,882
you know, I get prepared for that. It's a lot more basic spot on

1912
01:44:52,883 --> 01:44:55,351
them, but that's literally the best we want. Well.

1913
01:44:55,352 --> 01:44:59,907
But, I'm

1914
01:44:59,908 --> 01:45:04,538
not, uhm, Kerberin, I'm saying this. It's, it's, it's, it's. Our

1915
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:06,628
living, um.

1916
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,086
I have to find that. Is there a lot of media?

1917
01:45:09,087 --> 01:45:11,112
We don't really get the display, right?

1918
01:45:11,113 --> 01:45:13,835
Do you know? . Yeah, no, goodness,

1919
01:45:13,836 --> 01:45:17,372
ladies. Umm, we can't answer the answer to anything even.

1920
01:45:17,373 --> 01:45:20,617
Umm, I have been to you guys in the- I'm using a very interesting

1921
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:23,437
assembly that we set up the last time, uhh,

1922
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:26,316
the other cues here and the secondary question on that.

1923
01:45:26,317 --> 01:45:29,969
Umm. Bye Now if any of you guys said that I knew you were

1924
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:35,193
gonna show me some of these. Bye bye.

1925
01:45:35,194 --> 01:45:39,581
Alright. Thanks and have a good day.

1926
01:45:39,582 --> 01:45:42,555
Bye Yeah,

1927
01:45:42,556 --> 01:45:47,264
sounds a bit big up

1928
01:45:47,265 --> 01:45:50,687
to me there for especially by this one this stuff.

1929
01:45:50,688 --> 01:45:54,595
Love. Uhm.

1930
01:45:54,606 --> 01:45:56,488
I know that you like, uhh, if a lot of people ask me to

1931
01:45:56,489 --> 01:45:59,260
do a lot of interviews and stuff, I can think that he's a parentic,

1932
01:45:59,261 --> 01:46:01,969
except. So you could go through a standard, can I? Because all the time,

1933
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:06,119
that's certain. Yeah, yeah. And just stuff like this,

1934
01:46:06,157 --> 01:46:08,164
and then it's short frames. Yeah,

1935
01:46:08,165 --> 01:46:11,251
it's just, uhh,

1936
01:46:11,261 --> 01:46:13,938
we have features that are built out of the box,

1937
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:16,231
Loom, Jira. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1938
01:46:20,473 --> 01:46:24,147
Yeah. of stair straightener moments that he do those here.

1939
01:46:24,148 --> 01:46:27,170
I mean. Can you see what that looks like?

1940
01:46:40,531 --> 01:46:44,598
Cheerful.

1941
01:46:44,626 --> 01:46:47,915
Cheerful. Tying. Cheerful.

1942
01:46:47,916 --> 01:46:54,270
Hold on. It's-it's saying

1943
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:57,451
No that nothing-it's gotta be said. Everybody i'm all over with a Smither bland.

1944
01:46:57,452 --> 01:47:00,071
It's a It's great.

1945
01:47:00,376 --> 01:47:02,651
And then we should be able to change it and learn from all that

1946
01:47:02,732 --> 01:47:05,491
different size. See you.

1947
01:47:05,492 --> 01:47:08,716
Where can we see the label if it's playing?

1948
01:47:10,011 --> 01:47:13,471
Don't you dominate your estimate and apply the label?

1949
01:47:13,472 --> 01:47:15,730
Whichever piece you choose. Mm.

1950
01:47:15,731 --> 01:47:15,880
You

1951
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:25,222
Yeah, so this must be done on a rise,

1952
01:47:25,223 --> 01:47:27,687
right? I don't know if you can figure out how to lengthen this there.

1953
01:47:28,184 --> 01:47:30,516
Try to lengthen. Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.

1954
01:47:30,517 --> 01:47:33,105
So, there's been stair types presented.

1955
01:47:33,106 --> 01:47:36,903
You've got pants there, you've got them, you've got them cradings there,

1956
01:47:36,904 --> 01:47:39,717
you've got them, you know, they're crickets. Yes. And concrete stairs,

1957
01:47:39,718 --> 01:47:42,788
what that chair type was, put it back on chair type,

1958
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:44,804
and pick it whether you are ready to complain.

1959
01:47:45,282 --> 01:47:49,652
Oh, I think, okay. Good. And then the top of the chair you're talking,

1960
01:47:49,653 --> 01:47:52,369
pick which, whether you want the channel, the instant channel,

1961
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:56,439
or if you, uhm, answer them It calculates all the language to do all

1962
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:59,305
those things. You should put in the frame,

1963
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,686
or you should really calculate very much your simulated bomb.

1964
01:48:01,687 --> 01:48:04,293
Bye-bye. If you will,

1965
01:48:04,294 --> 01:48:08,553
dump in all these line lines. You say, how many you got at the

1966
01:48:08,554 --> 01:48:12,168
bottom then? Time to turn. Okay.

1967
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:20,317
That you got your, your standard of the-

1968
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:30,821
I suppose,

1969
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:33,498
yeah, there's a lot of energy.

1970
01:48:34,413 --> 01:48:37,623
So, look how I feel this way. See you in the house. No. 10.1

1971
01:48:37,624 --> 01:48:39,064
there. Okay.

1972
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:49,540
Umm.

1973
01:48:49,835 --> 01:48:54,205
you So,

1974
01:48:54,258 --> 01:48:56,332
you know, if you're a bad guy,

1975
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:58,443
you're going to have to fight all those lives,

1976
01:48:58,444 --> 01:49:01,493
and then you're going to have to fight. Bye. Hey,

1977
01:49:01,494 --> 01:49:04,372

There's me. Okay. Good. I

1979
01:49:09,107 --> 01:49:12,161

Uh, uh, these are, um. You Yeah,

1981
01:49:17,153 --> 01:49:20,712
we're really speaking about it a lot. I like it too for,

1982
01:49:20,713 --> 01:49:23,471
um, estimators that aren't as seasoned.

1983

I didn't play the game. remember 7 8 Uh,

1987
01:49:35,079 --> 01:49:37,323
5 1 3 in the soil, yeah,

1988
01:49:37,324 --> 01:49:41,300
yeah. Last man, who had to kill us at a business job?

1989
01:49:41,301 --> 01:49:44,214
Thank you. They spelled it out, and then pretty much the car,

1990
01:49:44,215 --> 01:49:46,834
so it had to be in, so that's kind of nice.

1991

Great. See ya.

1994
01:49:56,463 --> 01:49:59,549
Atlassian associated with great success. The I want you to buy a car.

1995
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:03,430
Okay. So there we go. But there must be a step above the rear.

1996
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:05,515
It's gonna be good.

1997
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:08,874
You These are,

1998
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:11,135
uhm,

1999
01:50:11,145 --> 01:50:13,395
these are all, yes, sorry,

2000
01:50:13,396 --> 01:50:16,251
eke, eke, eke, eke, eke, eke. and and you want,

2001
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:19,884
I mean, but I mean, it's for these shops and I'll be,

2002
01:50:20,718 --> 01:50:23,556
I'll be in the streamers, I'll be on the plant norms.

2003
01:50:23,557 --> 01:50:26,183
. . I'll be in the rainless, I'll be in the walrus,

2004
01:50:26,666 --> 01:50:29,016
and then, like, you take a, a slam,

2005
01:50:29,017 --> 01:50:31,596
like, a good wine, be in the plant.

2006
01:50:31,597 --> 01:50:34,827
So, you can do things just to have me twice when you have a

2007
01:50:34,832 --> 01:50:37,925
review. You have 70 clients, and it doesn't matter if you have any clients,

2008
01:50:37,926 --> 01:50:40,303
so just lay yourself a bit. Thank you very It makes sense.

2009
01:50:40,597 --> 01:50:44,685
It's really, really, really nice. It takes a while to do,

2010
01:50:44,686 --> 01:50:46,714
uhm, the better to make a sense of this amount,

2011
01:50:46,715 --> 01:50:48,866
but it's, And once it's done,

2012
01:50:48,965 --> 01:50:51,435
you can go down based on some of the S.E.A.

2013
01:50:52,634 --> 01:50:54,826
You know, especially if you do a lot of hand rolls and spinach.

2014
01:50:55,246 --> 01:50:55,480
Yeah. Go.

2015
01:51:02,255 --> 01:51:05,486
Yeah, you know what I hear? Status, yeah. Alright. Yep. We'll be right It's

2016
01:51:05,487 --> 01:51:07,569
their case to the spiders,

2017
01:51:08,634 --> 01:51:11,138
and, you know, all sorts of people.

2018
01:51:11,191 --> 01:51:14,313
So, all of their issues. you And,

2019
01:51:14,314 --> 01:51:16,660
you know, a lot of the shops I'm getting to,

2020
01:51:16,661 --> 01:51:20,419
they're, they're doing their miscellaneous making awesome.

2021
01:51:20,035 --> 01:51:23,960
Awesome. I mean, I got a permanent maturity at LaborCon vases,

2022
01:51:24,772 --> 01:51:27,206
which they didn't do that,

2023
01:51:27,207 --> 01:51:32,022
but umm. you were really missing the opportunity to really

2024
01:51:32,245 --> 01:51:34,989
get really deep care of all my estimates.

2025
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:37,709
Alright, I'll see ya. If you're a well-known,

2026
01:51:38,631 --> 01:51:41,161
where are I from? It's where I have to go down the journey,

2027
01:51:41,162 --> 01:51:43,992
alright? You can be that animal without having to do it,

2028
01:51:43,993 --> 01:51:48,052
or I'll just do it. Which was virtual with a set of printings.

2029
01:51:49,128 --> 01:51:52,324
You have to lead out.

2030
01:51:52,325 --> 01:51:56,653
You have to use the computer and the mouse. Umm.

2031
01:51:56,664 --> 01:51:58,962
Here's the coping machine and stuff I have.

2032
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:01,817
Here's the hero. We'll go down here by now.

2033
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:04,754
You see, you have a manual manual,

2034
01:52:04,755 --> 01:52:07,204
or if you're interested, uh,

2035
01:52:07,215 --> 01:52:11,780
we have a manual manual. We'll see in a minute. In we're being able

2036
01:52:11,781 --> 01:52:14,779
to find the manual and then have the error.

2037
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:18,851
We're being use, sophisticated amount of element. So we're going to be able to

2038
01:52:18,852 --> 01:52:23,617
drag in, so that's where the drag in will have to

2039
01:52:23,778 --> 01:52:27,470
go. Okay. We're going to be able to drag so we're going to be

2040
01:52:27,471 --> 01:52:29,543
able to in,

2041
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:35,383
so we're going to be We're

2042
01:52:35,384 --> 01:52:40,118
going to be able to drag so we're going be

2043
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:43,256
able if you have a runner and drag it down,

2044
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:45,451
try to, you know, draw a little bit of just,

2045
01:52:45,452 --> 01:52:49,591
you know. So. Okay.

2046
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:52,864
Okay. Yeah.

2047
01:52:52,865 --> 01:52:53,355
See.

2048
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:59,369
Umm. Mm-hmm.

2049
01:53:05,676 --> 01:53:09,801
Yeah, it's not my question, it's not one of the aspects of my opinion,

2050
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,412
but it's making it just a big project.

2051
01:53:12,599 --> 01:53:15,888
Right? It's a big project. Right? There's feels nothing to be done on SMB

2052
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:20,155
that can make life easier, like the amount more than it is in similar

2053
01:53:20,156 --> 01:53:22,803
notion of perfecting. The hours are limited,

2054
01:53:22,804 --> 01:53:27,628
uhm, but we're a big part of this year.

2055
01:53:28,269 --> 01:53:30,224
Seriously, it's so important. We'll do it. Now it. We'll be there in a

2056
01:53:30,225 --> 01:53:30,940
little Okay.

2057
01:53:37,951 --> 01:53:42,419
Bitbucket was paying me for a bit of a while,

2058
01:53:42,429 --> 01:53:42,893
and he was,

2059
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm gonna go get a couple of bits of couple of different bits of

2060
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:56,286
stuff. If you don't, this one is here,

2061
01:53:57,107 --> 01:54:01,223
that's what it is. That's Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

2062
01:54:02,071 --> 01:54:06,613
More work and stuff that other companies don't want to do,

2063
01:54:06,614 --> 01:54:08,954
but they're all like, I'm going to take a peek.

2064
01:54:09,305 --> 01:54:12,760
That's great. Thank So it's like, that's probably good to focus.

2065
01:54:12,761 --> 01:54:15,349
You know, that's what they're gonna talk. That's what they're gonna tell people.

2066
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,151
You know, it's like, uh, really gonna focus on,

2067
01:54:18,152 --> 01:54:21,984
difficult to do, and that's what I need to work for.

2068
01:54:21,985 --> 01:54:24,186
Well, actually, if they pick up an erection job,

2069
01:54:24,187 --> 01:54:26,191
that's what I think somebody else will steal. Y'all, man.

2070
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:28,718
You've got all this miscellaneous that you need to go buy out.

2071
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,808
I thought it was so warm. Yeah.

2072
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,231
It seems low-hanging for you. Yeah. Yeah.

2073
01:54:34,232 --> 01:54:37,787
But you've got to set all this stuff up for it.

2074
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:40,645
Mm-hmm. And you're right,

2075
01:54:40,646 --> 01:54:45,454
I'm going to shut the bellow on. Lovely. Yeah,

2076
01:54:45,455 --> 01:54:48,375
I'm worried about it.

2077
01:54:48,376 --> 01:54:51,854
Yeah. I was like, it's a nightmare. Yeah. There. Okay. Yeah.

2078
01:54:53,832 --> 01:54:55,930
I don't really show up. I have no shop,

2079
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:58,351
ladder shop, you know, they just do all that stuff.

2080
01:54:58,352 --> 01:55:00,914
If you get this,

2081
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:03,963
I've been in that shop for quite a bit. You're the one doing it

2082
01:55:04,606 --> 01:55:08,971
again. Yeah, yeah. Eight. I can't put on my father from the quantum benefit.

2083
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,658
That's all. So you probably know exactly what he was,

2084
01:55:11,659 --> 01:55:13,727
but but he's kind of in the hand,

2085
01:55:13,728 --> 01:55:17,310
you know. I want to say, He's good. He's I didn't thought it was

2086
01:55:17,311 --> 01:55:19,714
good, but it's stainless, the momentum, nickel, silver,

2087
01:55:19,715 --> 01:55:22,209
brass, bronze, and aluminum. Clearly, they're all in chemistry!

2088
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:24,762
Thank you. Right, so it was extremely high market.

2089
01:55:24,999 --> 01:55:28,127
Sure, eh. But I think if you get into the pants,

2090
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,425
you're stuck. Yeah, uh.

2091
01:55:30,436 --> 01:55:33,016
you Yeah, damn it, you can walk down through the street.

2092
01:55:33,017 --> 01:55:35,576
Umm.

2093
01:55:35,586 --> 01:55:37,772
I wonder if that's the best place to come down here.

2094
01:55:37,773 --> 01:55:41,770
Yeah. Bye. Umm, you can look at what it was doing in science,

2095
01:55:41,974 --> 01:55:44,244
and get delayed by the past day.

2096
01:55:44,949 --> 01:55:49,544
And you have a lot of those. But you're really unclaying,

2097
01:55:49,545 --> 01:55:54,112
or you know, with all the pain on there.

2098
01:55:54,328 --> 01:55:54,636
You

2099
01:55:59,606 --> 01:56:01,391
And I see that there's a wonderful one. And four or five. So what

2100
01:56:01,392 --> 01:56:04,578
are those patterns you need? Good. Here's another one,

2101
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:08,548
okay? Is it missing what we're getting at?

2102
01:56:08,549 --> 01:56:12,834
A picture of a clean type and we want to- You talking about right

2103
01:56:12,835 --> 01:56:16,822
here, this part then? Yeah. Stop. That's a show clean type.

2104
01:56:16,823 --> 01:56:20,985
That's a song. I'm sorry. Yeah,

2105
01:56:20,986 --> 01:56:23,808
you can add whatever you want here.

2106
01:56:23,809 --> 01:56:26,796
Be sure to hear just the buttons that catch the owls.

2107
01:56:26,797 --> 01:56:31,212
So if you're going to have,

2108
01:56:31,213 --> 01:56:34,026
if you're going to create something else here,

2109
01:56:34,027 --> 01:56:37,315
now you've got to create. Yeah. Something in,

2110
01:56:37,316 --> 01:56:42,119
umm, a labor code or somewhere else that calculates the hours of putting

2111
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,254
the, puts our CO kit.

2112
01:56:44,952 --> 01:56:47,208
You see that? We need an open one on our end.

2113
01:56:47,544 --> 01:56:50,505
Yup. Well, you want to store this up on the uh,

2114
01:56:50,516 --> 01:56:53,194
probably, Yeah. Yup.

Y Yup. Yup.

2121
01:57:23,076 --> 01:57:31,116
And chute, or what are you looking for?

2122
01:57:31,117 --> 01:57:33,403
Thank you, bro. You're going to clean that up,

2123
01:57:33,404 --> 01:57:35,538
so I don't want you to pressure me at the person.

2124
01:57:36,003 --> 01:57:38,545
Okay. Now, how do you get me to clean up?

2125
01:57:38,807 --> 01:57:40,877
Please if you want something.

2126
01:57:40,976 --> 01:57:43,880
Yep. So I've been approached by a lot of people,

2127
01:57:43,881 --> 01:57:46,980
so I've been shot away from it for a Bye!

2128
01:57:46,981 --> 01:57:51,616
So what I'll do is create a

2129
01:57:51,617 --> 01:57:55,236
labor operation. Thank you.

2130
01:57:55,237 --> 01:57:58,302
For that. Pretty much the talk about play.

2131
01:57:58,303 --> 01:58:00,445
Uhm,

2132
01:58:00,456 --> 01:58:04,982
I-I-I'm creating a labor operation for play for- College League

2133
01:58:04,983 --> 01:58:09,335
or whatever you want to, point that towards the new labor group,

2134
01:58:09,714 --> 01:58:12,633
and then you got to put time into- where that I needed to labor

2135
01:58:12,634 --> 01:58:15,091
against, so, you know, sure that,

2136
01:58:15,092 --> 01:58:18,178
right, but anyway. Everything's like cutting,

2137
01:58:18,179 --> 01:58:20,768
but now having- Alrighty. Yup. Yup.

2138
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:23,141
That's all of me, it's background. We're working,

2139
01:58:23,142 --> 01:58:31,624
yeah. Would

2140
01:58:31,625 --> 01:58:34,583
it be only on display, or do you wanna play instead?

2141
01:58:34,584 --> 01:58:38,862
Uh-uh. Still anything.

2142
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:41,301
Okay, so if I know about Mountain,

2143
01:58:41,302 --> 01:58:43,481
sometimes. Focus.

2144
01:58:43,482 --> 01:58:47,126
Umm.

2145
01:58:47,136 --> 01:58:49,964
What are you talking about? Maybe not one life.

2146
01:58:50,628 --> 01:58:53,442
You don't have to create the- Like, we're good to put it into,

2147
01:58:54,023 --> 01:58:57,190
yeah. Yeah,

2148
01:58:57,191 --> 01:59:00,658
that's- that's the only thing that's weird to- I it's all these around us

2149
01:59:00,659 --> 01:59:03,741
and they've matched our PC form. Yeah, I've done it a little bit.

2150
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:06,848
With the theme fall under, you can hear it all the way in the

2151
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:09,411
brain. Oh, what's it not there?

2152
01:59:09,412 --> 01:59:12,441
Okay. That's what I'm doing.

2153
01:59:12,529 --> 01:59:15,223
That's what I'm doing. you should be far cut.

2154
01:59:15,224 --> 01:59:17,229
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2155
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:19,636
Can I put you to do that? I'm just buried in there.

2156
01:59:19,714 --> 01:59:22,109
I can't believe that you gave a lot. I think any more.

2157
01:59:22,305 --> 01:59:24,622
But, um. Boom. He is,

2158
01:59:24,623 --> 01:59:29,971
uh, uh,

2159
01:59:29,982 --> 01:59:32,219
blah blah blah blah. Yeah, what?

2160
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:36,904
Bye bye. How do you want to figure this? How the time

2161
01:59:36,905 --> 01:59:39,334
you want to put on it, and you sort of suck flat on them

2162
01:59:39,335 --> 01:59:41,791
or piece. You want to say, based off.

2163
01:59:41,792 --> 01:59:43,911
I don't think it'll be a flat on that,

2164
01:59:43,912 --> 01:59:46,079
or piece on it. It's just a city that I'm very,

2165
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,350
very lonely. So much for each other,

2166
01:59:48,464 --> 01:59:50,924
whatever. I don't You can do it. You guys,

2167
01:59:50,993 --> 01:59:53,771
plasma comes something, or anything gets thrown in the hopper,

2168
01:59:53,772 --> 01:59:56,454
and you take it to a station and some guy cleans it.

2169
01:59:56,789 --> 01:59:58,833
Forward, you do it. We'll have to go. The guy is cutting, and we've

2170
01:59:58,834 --> 02:00:01,011
both worked since kissing, uhm, Tina.

2171
02:00:01,091 --> 02:00:03,207
How do you guys? The guy is 7 lately, Marley.

2172
02:00:03,426 --> 02:00:05,796
It is the guy. What are you doing with the cleaning? Thank joining me.

2173
02:00:05,797 --> 02:00:08,209
The guy is cutting, he's not going to touch.

2174
02:00:08,263 --> 02:00:10,681
He's going to cut him to the next thing. The next guy is to

2175
02:00:10,682 --> 02:00:12,865
line with the fear, uhm,

2176
02:00:12,876 --> 02:00:15,256
those guys. They're- really clean as the new network.

2177
02:00:15,431 --> 02:00:18,732
That's for a new speaker. Yeah, that's not what it is.

2178
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:21,485
Nope. Who doesn't need some point?

2179
02:00:21,486 --> 02:00:26,134
side. . . . Okay, better small understand what we do.

2180
02:00:26,245 --> 02:00:28,340
Okay, and then you get a start for the workstation.

2181
02:00:28,376 --> 02:00:30,851
So, okay, some of those. votes. I think division detail,

2182
02:00:30,852 --> 02:00:33,166
the guy who's making it, the guy who's cutting it.

2183
02:00:34,033 --> 02:00:36,103
So, it would be, I think, very, in fact,

2184
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:39,141
you know what I I think the is, I'm here to do the separate

2185
02:00:39,142 --> 02:00:41,551
guy. No, it's, it's the same guy.

2186
02:00:41,552 --> 02:00:44,387
So, we have a, or a toilet and water out here,

2187
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:46,747
and an hill. Cool. Yeah,

2188
02:00:46,748 --> 02:00:49,620
we're going stolen, I think, and as he's taking out,

2189
02:00:49,621 --> 02:00:51,729
and been trying to work, he's hitting them with a runner.

2190
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,791
We're all eating that. Okay, perfect, very,

2191
02:00:53,792 --> 02:00:57,704
That makes sense. That's what we're eating, and it's basically,

2192
02:00:57,705 --> 02:01:00,884
I mean, we had a cow-locked shuttle.

2193
02:01:01,831 --> 02:01:05,397
While this is cutting, he's cleaning and pulling it off.

2194
02:01:05,456 --> 02:01:08,095
You'll be able to toss it into a cutter. It's just cuss.

2195
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,142
Let me let the knife down here. Okay.

2196
02:01:11,335 --> 02:01:14,284
So it's coming out of there. Well, uh, some people just get to cut

2197
02:01:14,285 --> 02:01:17,632
and pump it up. Yeah, but you get less visible.

2198
02:01:17,633 --> 02:01:19,928
Here's a, We'll let it come in and check, like,

2199
02:01:19,929 --> 02:01:22,083
a year from now, and we'll let it change its life.

2200
02:01:22,312 --> 02:01:25,729
Well, hey, I bet, um, it's only two minutes on my way.

2201
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:27,850
You haven't eaten yet, so just rename it,

2202
02:01:27,851 --> 02:01:30,614
cut and clean. Yeah, so, yeah, you could do that.

2203
02:01:30,615 --> 02:01:33,550
Uh, but, yeah, we have a separate ratio.

2204
02:01:33,551 --> 02:01:37,975
Thanks for watching. And you can kind of split that outside the level of

2205
02:01:37,976 --> 02:01:40,712
cut times this and then the clean out of this.

2206
02:01:41,049 --> 02:01:44,633
Yeah. And put your- Very, very, very within cut times.

2207
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:49,548
Yes. And then both of those operations flow down into one

2208
02:01:49,549 --> 02:01:53,019
box. I was feeling it would be easier to make the right of an

2209
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:55,970
impact, but I was saying, this is the cut clean.

2210
02:01:55,971 --> 02:01:59,511
Okay. Yeah. I mean,

2211
02:01:59,512 --> 02:02:02,851
it's your thing too, from the same way as the packaging bar,

2212
02:02:02,852 --> 02:02:06,186
but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Clear. You don't have to change your- I don't have

2213
02:02:06,187 --> 02:02:10,032
an operation, right? Um, everything that will believe we're kidding you,

2214
02:02:10,033 --> 02:02:13,831
sir. Let's work. Yeah. So. So,

2215
02:02:13,832 --> 02:02:16,113
Yeah, you could just, uhm,

2216
02:02:16,123 --> 02:02:19,875
buy, uhm, uhm, buy as well.

2217
02:02:20,497 --> 02:02:23,683
QC kind of just aren't here. Thank you. Sorry.

2218
02:02:24,011 --> 02:02:26,527
Yeah. That's the check,

2219
02:02:26,528 --> 02:02:29,419
that's the interview. It's always been an interview,

2220
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,897
you know. Just. . It's a 30,000,000,000.

2221
02:02:31,898 --> 02:02:36,519
It's good. All

2222
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,791
right.

2223
02:02:45,623 --> 02:02:48,306
I think we're gonna go. So it's like you don't want to do this

2224
02:02:48,307 --> 02:02:50,853
right. There's no more time I can get it.

2225
02:02:50,854 --> 02:02:53,127
You better, right? If you need it,

2226
02:02:53,128 --> 02:02:57,002
you can't clean the center. That's not where it goes,

2227
02:02:57,003 --> 02:02:58,010
it's including the thing.

2228
02:03:11,791 --> 02:03:14,851
You know if you don't do that, you might want to be able to

2229
02:03:14,852 --> 02:03:17,233
make more operations and labor groups.

2230
02:03:17,406 --> 02:03:19,831
Yeah. Ah.

2231
02:03:19,832 --> 02:03:22,430
Look.

2232
02:03:22,431 --> 02:03:21,950
Go.

2233
02:03:35,851 --> 02:03:40,851
Yeah,

2234
02:03:42,257 --> 02:03:44,365
the bargain rates are good to go. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

2235
02:03:44,366 --> 02:03:46,736
Yeah. Yeah. Let's it.

2236
02:03:52,836 --> 02:03:54,425
It's the minute it's later operations. Thank you

2237
02:04:00,871 --> 02:04:05,871
That's

2238
02:04:07,290 --> 02:04:11,713
right here at the bottom. Hello. Yes,

2239
02:04:11,714 --> 02:04:15,586
all done. Yes, all done. I'm going to go 10% and 5% in South

2240
02:04:15,587 --> 02:04:19,594
America. So, cut. So,

2241
02:04:19,845 --> 02:04:22,922
those, you can change the description if you want.

2242
02:04:22,923 --> 02:04:25,176
So, cut and clean. That's what I've got, like. Thank you.

2243
02:04:25,177 --> 02:04:28,908
Cause that's what's going to show you. This description right here is what's going

2244
02:04:28,909 --> 02:04:32,171
to show you what the time is. And I don't remind you to decide

2245
02:04:32,172 --> 02:04:34,442
how this is going to be just. . . Okay, this is where we're

2246
02:04:34,443 --> 02:04:36,829
going to get it in hopefully you can park. Yeah,

2247
02:04:37,771 --> 02:04:45,885
yeah, I mean, lot of friends. Always. And we'll see you Yeah.

2248
02:04:46,448 --> 02:04:48,454
Now you're going to get the tunnel. Yeah,

2249
02:04:48,455 --> 02:04:51,344
so the tunnel. I love this. The tunnel is going to be the experience.

2250
02:04:54,179 --> 02:04:55,555
Well, part of the tunnel will be.

2251
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:10,260
I'm

2252
02:05:10,261 --> 02:05:14,664
leaving for a deep, wrong cusp. I'll see you in the uhh,

2253
02:05:14,665 --> 02:05:16,808
uhh, if we have a unit on it, it's constant.

2254
02:05:16,816 --> 02:05:19,910
In between, we get a case in the phone call,

2255
02:05:19,911 --> 02:05:21,952
yep, like, from him to him. Hey guys. I'm a guy,

2256
02:05:21,953 --> 02:05:26,346
so I don't really like it. Yeah, I'm a good guy.

2257
02:05:26,632 --> 02:05:29,491
Yeah, I don't have to keep that up.

2258
02:05:29,492 --> 02:05:31,762
I don't know, I'm eager to do it, uhh,

2259
02:05:31,773 --> 02:05:33,884
because you're paying me eager. Yeah,

2260
02:05:33,885 --> 02:05:35,899
um, that's me, if I'm in a break,

2261
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,293
uhh, if it's something, I might be- I'm getting ready to start with the

2262
02:05:38,294 --> 02:05:41,116
text, yes, you would. If not email me,

2263
02:05:41,218 --> 02:05:43,401
and then I'll generally get to that blog.

2264
02:05:43,402 --> 02:05:46,285
Bye. Or,

2265
02:05:46,286 --> 02:05:48,626
you know, give me a hint, it's fun on the East Coast,

2266
02:05:48,627 --> 02:05:51,419
like, probably in the afternoon, when I, when I think of the time,

2267
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,611
it's like, you know, cause you're playing out, you know.

2268
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:55,937
If you have a business to come,

2269
02:05:56,989 --> 02:06:00,085
actually, I need to replenish some of this as far as I don't get

2270
02:06:00,177 --> 02:06:02,569
it. You So,

2271
02:06:02,865 --> 02:06:04,925
I shoot you in need of this, okay? Yeah, yeah,

2272
02:06:04,998 --> 02:06:09,120
yeah, yeah. What's your even? You want to see more?

2273
02:06:09,121 --> 02:06:10,578
Yeah, yeah. . . . . . . . . . . . .

2274
02:06:10,579 --> 02:06:15,107
. . Even more as

2275
02:06:15,108 --> 02:06:17,114
I have. .

2276
02:06:17,115 --> 02:06:19,956
. .

2277
02:06:19,957 --> 02:06:22,798
. .

2278
02:06:22,799 --> 02:06:25,956
. So that's it.

2279
02:06:25,957 --> 02:06:31,896
3.3 minutes, and why don't we increase for our added additional content?

2280
02:06:31,897 --> 02:06:33,941
We will increase it by then.

2281
02:06:33,942 --> 02:06:36,687
Uh, how many minutes you have done?

2282
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:39,294
Three more minutes. One, two, three. One,

2283
02:06:39,295 --> 02:06:41,660
two, three. One, three.

2284
02:06:41,971 --> 02:06:44,130
Two.

2285
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:50,981
Cut was,

2286
02:06:50,982 --> 02:06:53,890
Umm.

2287
02:06:53,901 --> 02:06:58,626
Face off of the breakdown that you guys had when it

2288
02:06:58,627 --> 02:07:00,720
was, Like, excuse me.

2289
02:07:04,017 --> 02:07:06,074
Suddenly, Scott was, ah,

2290
02:07:06,075 --> 02:07:08,270
harder than one good. Good. Bye. So that's it.

2291
02:07:08,271 --> 02:07:10,882
There wasn't other shit where we learned.

2292
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:15,116
It was, like, a split. I don't want to,

2293
02:07:15,117 --> 02:07:17,232
like, put sand or something. Go! Which, uhh,

2294
02:07:17,253 --> 02:07:20,041
which, the products were high on each way through the boat.

2295
02:07:20,266 --> 02:07:23,550
So, uhm, 2-4-7-5-8.

2296
02:07:23,299 --> 02:07:27,710
Great. 10-0 is more by 40%.

2297
02:07:27,711 --> 02:07:30,502
Umm,

2298
02:07:30,503 --> 02:07:35,032
45-0-6-0. Umm, 45-0-6-0.

2299
02:07:35,033 --> 02:07:39,960
Umm, 45-0-6-0.

2300
02:07:39,991 --> 02:07:42,164
And then for the technical, it was high,

2301
02:07:42,165 --> 02:07:44,977
uh, 100 quilcet, but we're talking 4 hours,

2302
02:07:44,978 --> 02:07:47,104
actually, now it's, uh, awesome. Yeah.

2303
02:07:47,602 --> 02:07:50,217
Yeah. Yeah. And then 2,4,

2304
02:07:50,218 --> 02:07:54,640
0, 7, 5, 8, Tecmo was low by 18%.

2305
02:07:54,795 --> 02:07:58,605
similar. You've already come back in some of that previous tape.

2306
02:07:58,948 --> 02:08:01,575
Yeah, yeah. Some of this,

2307
02:08:01,576 --> 02:08:05,184
yeah, some of this may be based on- Some of the changes we do

2308
02:08:05,185 --> 02:08:07,842
may be might have changed a little bit,

2309
02:08:07,843 --> 02:08:11,971
but I don't think we changed the curd, so that probably didn't change.

2310
02:08:11,972 --> 02:08:15,255
We've never changed that handling,

2311
02:08:15,256 --> 02:08:17,201
unless, you know, Tambourine and, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, well, the,

2312
02:08:17,202 --> 02:08:20,200
the, yeah.

2313
02:08:21,025 --> 02:08:23,708
Yeah. Oh no. This is 10% sound fair,

2314
02:08:23,709 --> 02:08:27,426
anybody be back in. And then, it never sounds fair,

2315
02:08:27,427 --> 02:08:30,806
so I, I was just asking which ones were in one direction,

2316
02:08:30,807 --> 02:08:34,431
so like 7, 5, 8 projects, their minutes being used for coals,

2317
02:08:34,432 --> 02:08:36,494
to be used for coals, and, . Yeah.

2318
02:08:36,495 --> 02:08:41,742
And then the two other style of projects,

2319
02:08:41,762 --> 02:08:44,016
or break it.

2320
02:08:44,017 --> 02:08:46,610
Okay, straight kind of column,

2321
02:08:46,611 --> 02:08:48,699
straight kind of bleeds. So,

2322
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:53,230
um, so the tech world was alive on the- So,

2323
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:55,507
like, TV sets about, like, two,

2324
02:08:55,523 --> 02:08:57,722
three. Alright, are you splitting your indeed?

2325
02:08:57,723 --> 02:09:01,718
We would ten- you technically might need seven hours.

2326
02:09:01,945 --> 02:09:04,743
Yeah, most, but, most of them are on TV.

2327
02:09:05,034 --> 02:09:08,011
So, let's straighten. Unless you've done something to keep.

2328
02:09:08,012 --> 02:09:10,874
. . And you're sure, are basically assuming,

2329
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:14,311
I'm just shocked that it's definitely being fair.

2330
02:09:14,549 --> 02:09:16,631
It's not taking care of So, yeah.

2331
02:09:16,632 --> 02:09:19,385
So, okay. Um, yeah, let's, uhm.

2332
02:09:19,386 --> 02:09:25,096
I'll you on the next to

2333
02:09:25,097 --> 02:09:27,954
that. Let's start with, you know,

2334
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:31,057
meeting your point.

2335
02:09:31,058 --> 02:09:34,681
It sounds like. I said, I remember you, and we're fighting it long.

2336
02:09:34,875 --> 02:09:38,424
Yeah, so it used to probably used to go 20.5 to say,

2337
02:09:38,841 --> 02:09:41,180
yeah. Umm. Uh. Bye I can't undo the,

2338
02:09:41,181 --> 02:09:45,858
like, I'm not sure I'm getting a whole lot of those

2339
02:09:45,859 --> 02:09:48,036
numbers for you, cause it's like, yeah, yeah.

2340
02:09:48,304 --> 02:09:50,993
Ooh, small job. Yeah, yeah,

2341
02:09:50,994 --> 02:09:52,995
yeah. Okay,

2342
02:09:52,996 --> 02:09:56,539
here's, here's the budget,

2343
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:59,502
and that's really the budget. you I don't know how that,

2344
02:09:59,503 --> 02:10:05,016
how that budget is.

2345
02:10:05,017 --> 02:10:07,163
. . I don't know what it was. . . ah,

2346
02:10:07,164 --> 02:10:09,778
it was like . . . well, uhm,

2347
02:10:09,779 --> 02:10:12,996
uhm, most of the breakouts.

2348
02:10:12,997 --> 02:10:17,640
are stuff that we look at in drawings and adjust the breakouts

2349
02:10:17,641 --> 02:10:20,124
yet. So, uhm,

2350
02:10:20,135 --> 02:10:23,716
you've got I've heard in some more of the experience,

2351
02:10:23,717 --> 02:10:26,006
uh,

2352
02:10:26,017 --> 02:10:28,116
that it's been better to, well,

2353
02:10:28,117 --> 02:10:30,923
might estimate enough Whatever it was, was what type of spit out.

2354
02:10:30,924 --> 02:10:34,957
Yeah. And then actual rules would be,

2355
02:10:35,178 --> 02:10:38,089
will be came in for a ball shot. Bye-bye. I'm not too much towards

2356
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:41,149
which are based on our experience.

2357
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:43,442
Right. Yeah, we're looking at it.

2358
02:10:44,359 --> 02:10:46,746
based on the- you know, Ted was going to be,

2359
02:10:46,747 --> 02:10:48,994
uhm,

2360
02:10:49,005 --> 02:10:51,322
very consistent in what capital,

2361
02:10:51,323 --> 02:10:54,216
Detroit, MediRoute. How do you grow?

2362
02:10:54,217 --> 02:10:56,476
That's going to be consistently wrong. Yeah,

2363
02:10:56,477 --> 02:11:00,555
so if these are, if our comparisons are inconsistent.

2364
02:11:00,556 --> 02:11:05,866
Yes, Susan. And what that tells me is that what's inconsistent is

2365
02:11:05,867 --> 02:11:08,184
the budgeted number because disappearing.

2366
02:11:08,185 --> 02:11:11,596
Very. The linear line is very,

2367
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:15,343
it's not gonna be the same, no matter how many times you do it.

2368
02:11:15,344 --> 02:11:18,983
So, that's why I'm just kind of, Once it's open,

2369
02:11:18,984 --> 02:11:23,733
it's okay, but you're okay with what we should do right now.

2370
02:11:24,557 --> 02:11:29,595
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Every single

2371
02:11:29,596 --> 02:11:33,515
day, every day, I know that,

2372
02:11:33,794 --> 02:11:37,141
maybe I don't ever say that you're worried that I would be,

2373
02:11:37,142 --> 02:11:41,071
like, well, surrounded up to 90 years whole number.

2374
02:11:41,072 --> 02:11:43,281
. . Yeah, I'm, like,

2375
02:11:43,282 --> 02:11:46,062
I got a thing we don't . . . not thinking about it,

2376
02:11:46,063 --> 02:11:48,438
not saying that they're as a server, you know,

2377
02:11:48,439 --> 02:11:53,049
I don't know.. Umm, they can be more in percentage,

2378
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:55,272
but I don't, I'm always that gonna take.

2379
02:11:55,476 --> 02:11:58,289
Yes, uh. Hello. If,

2380
02:11:58,290 --> 02:12:02,146
if it takes three minutes to cut it, add an additional bit of anything

2381
02:12:02,147 --> 02:12:05,076
to it, then what's that three point when it needs to be done?

2382
02:12:05,077 --> 02:12:07,240
One cut. Something.

2383
02:12:08,037 --> 02:12:10,270
Which is a good point, too. It's going to last,

2384
02:12:10,271 --> 02:12:12,379
yeah. Yeah. That'd be one.

2385
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:14,586
So we go. One cut. So,

2386
02:12:14,587 --> 02:12:16,879
uhm,

2387
02:12:16,889 --> 02:12:19,451
yeah. I mean, that's a little bit of a good thing that probably,

2388
02:12:19,734 --> 02:12:23,307
you know, more so than- the machine will be able to buy it with,

2389
02:12:23,308 --> 02:12:26,064
if I have five minutes then it'll be fine with it.

2390
02:12:26,793 --> 02:12:29,071
I just have a little bit of- with mud. Bye!

2391
02:12:29,072 --> 02:12:31,172
I'm literally looking to say we all care for that,

2392
02:12:31,437 --> 02:12:35,197
be quite honest with you. We have a process that- whatever you're listening to.

2393
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:40,241
You're gonna do this same thing with burn. I can- you I

2394
02:12:40,242 --> 02:12:43,056
agree, make it five minutes for that kind of clean,

2395
02:12:43,057 --> 02:12:46,051
that makes sense. Thanks.

2396
02:12:46,052 --> 02:12:49,678
And then where are you going to convert image? So the bar is going

2397
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,750
to be in the bottom right. Yeah,

2398
02:12:52,124 --> 02:12:54,974
so that's good. Alright. Okay. All right. I'll go ahead Well,

2399
02:12:54,975 --> 02:12:58,127
that'll be a different here. More and more like it'll be a percentage of

2400
02:12:58,128 --> 02:13:00,556
it. Yeah. Yeah. Probably some of it.

2401
02:13:10,051 --> 02:13:14,653
and I think we should get some more of an impression

2402
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:18,753
as a status, it's uh.

2403
02:13:18,764 --> 02:13:23,675
Oh, and the cuts are perfect. Yeah. Used all that shit.

2404
02:13:23,676 --> 02:13:25,503
Yeah. Good.

2405
02:13:43,951 --> 02:13:48,951
It's

2406
02:13:49,847 --> 02:13:52,001
uh, the due passage is coming out, that's closest.

2407
02:13:52,002 --> 02:13:56,512
See you up, the day of this. You're back to hangin' up in the

2408
02:13:56,513 --> 02:13:58,634
morning. Yeah, when we did that,

2409
02:13:58,635 --> 02:14:01,704
it said, come on for later. You know. So he put that on the

2410
02:14:01,705 --> 02:14:06,090
machine today, but he actually said he heard there was a other passion,

2411
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:08,131
so he put two on the machine to see.

2412
02:14:08,132 --> 02:14:12,569
But he said something else was coming that's going to speed it up.

2413
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:19,521
I guess he's talking so much. And it's coming back and it's

2414
02:14:19,525 --> 02:14:22,109
going to be to add something. Yeah, I guess it's going to reach out

2415
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,689
to you at a terminal when they hit the host. You get a little

2416
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:25,219
bit

2417
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:35,634
Let's start with the bridge. I'm gonna

2418
02:14:35,635 --> 02:14:40,231
go ahead and figure out what to do with the part.

2419
02:14:40,232 --> 02:14:45,203
. . . . Oh, It's all a ton of manual

2420
02:14:45,229 --> 02:14:48,271
lip so we're talking about. Indeed.

2421
02:14:48,272 --> 02:14:51,123
So we actually changed the flight,

2422
02:14:51,124 --> 02:14:53,714
turning to, umm, Sam and Moon.

2423
02:14:53,715 --> 02:14:55,960
I'll to make We'll time.

2424
02:14:55,794 --> 02:14:58,593
You. And yeah,

2425
02:14:58,594 --> 02:15:00,878
hopes are the manual. So,

2426
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:06,210
yeah. So,

2427
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:09,023
yeah, hopes, you know.

2428
02:15:11,166 --> 02:15:14,397
I don't know if it's anything like this. Just a minute. Yeah,

2429
02:15:14,398 --> 02:15:18,203
sometimes it'll be better. So, here are where you've got both key shots,

2430
02:15:18,204 --> 02:15:20,878
right there. Uh,

2431
02:15:20,888 --> 02:15:23,255
yes. . If you get them, yes, let me just be able to shop

2432
02:15:23,256 --> 02:15:26,310
service here. And you can get them where it's more of your journey coming

2433
02:15:26,311 --> 02:15:28,780
out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, So.

2434
02:15:28,781 --> 02:15:33,483
Hello. These greats, actually, I'm aware of someone who

2435
02:15:33,484 --> 02:15:36,225
can marry your, like, machine video. Yeah.

2436
02:15:36,664 --> 02:15:42,735
So just. You give me a smart hand. I'm almost taken.

2437
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:46,111
I wouldn't mess with you again yet. Don't roll. We're going to Okay.

2438
02:15:45,924 --> 02:15:48,774
Okay. I'm going do some steps, first and second,

2439
02:15:48,775 --> 02:15:53,057
pro quarters, something like that and then, an upgrade course,

2440
02:15:53,058 --> 02:15:54,091
you can get a pro then. Yeah.

2441
02:16:02,141 --> 02:16:04,709
Uh, we got a picture of the quote from you,

2442
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:07,021
you know, on the smile of the purchase today.

2443
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:10,111
So, so we'll have- Yes, we'll leave us. Thank much.

2444
02:16:10,112 --> 02:16:13,427
We'll have the full integration and cleaning and for you to go on to

2445
02:16:13,428 --> 02:16:15,849
the status. So you can go on everything.

2446
02:16:16,497 --> 02:16:20,399
But that's gonna be where it goes. Go ahead. Good. So, uh,

2447
02:16:20,409 --> 02:16:23,361
it was only just to get that in return. Yesterday,

2448
02:16:23,362 --> 02:16:25,390
so we can have it as this meeting point today.

2449
02:16:25,391 --> 02:16:28,645
But, You Yeah, it's even if even we get ordered today,

2450
02:16:28,646 --> 02:16:31,965
my guess is we're not having the IT support at all to get that

2451
02:16:32,197 --> 02:16:34,910
help and to get it and everything. I don't know what to do.

2452
02:16:34,911 --> 02:16:38,144
So, you know, I feel like we're really just in.

2453
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:42,605
Is that Jessica for you? Um. No,

2454
02:16:42,624 --> 02:16:46,792
it's perfect. I mean, me and Helen are so little for us,

2455
02:16:46,843 --> 02:16:49,800
I guess. So, when you're at estimate, a big job is who's gonna ask

2456
02:16:49,801 --> 02:16:51,809
Nesta? Thanks. No.

2457
02:16:51,810 --> 02:16:56,809
Sometimes

2458
02:16:56,828 --> 02:16:58,650
a project engineer, when he's doing a changer, is that- I don't even know

2459
02:16:58,651 --> 02:17:01,777
where he chops me and be like, yeah, I bet.

2460
02:17:01,778 --> 02:17:06,433
I got, like, 30 of these Father's Land or Circles or- I have

2461
02:17:06,434 --> 02:17:09,544
this weird profile. Can we see if you have something in your temples so

2462
02:17:09,545 --> 02:17:13,055
you can kind of get close and tell the owners play the need to

2463
02:17:13,203 --> 02:17:16,167
have. I'm if you're in the place.

2464
02:17:16,168 --> 02:17:17,346
I'm not in the type of protest, but I see a price of a

2465
02:17:17,347 --> 02:17:19,894
curious model. Ah,

2466
02:17:19,895 --> 02:17:22,171
but I'm doing that. Now, there's new day.

2467
02:17:22,172 --> 02:17:27,013
I can't even take interest in it. I've got to be an emphasis.

2468
02:17:27,014 --> 02:17:29,213
Hey, we have, uh, uh, the, uh, Nestin module that's in,

2469
02:17:29,214 --> 02:17:31,792
uh, chat well. I've got, uh, Chindesk, I've got the plates.

2470
02:17:31,793 --> 02:17:33,987
Uh, they will not, they'll not,

2471
02:17:33,988 --> 02:17:36,064
uh, uh, Nestin, uh, for Nestin.

2472
02:17:36,065 --> 02:17:40,877
Don't I guess since we've worked a lot on the stance

2473
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:43,249
of the limited, needless, normal theory thing,

2474
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:46,040
there's a price of a trip that was so long. Uh-uh.

2475
02:17:46,041 --> 02:17:50,156
. . . . . No.

2476
02:17:50,157 --> 02:17:52,207
No. No.

2477
02:17:52,442 --> 02:17:57,014
No. You Now I just do the

2478
02:17:57,015 --> 02:18:01,087
ship in a completely different direction here. But I'll talk about the market.

2479
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:03,151
I'll see if there's anything else in it. Thank you.

2480
02:18:03,152 --> 02:18:08,041
One of the big takeaways from my A and

2481
02:18:08,042 --> 02:18:10,241
C R that we had this week was,

2482
02:18:10,242 --> 02:18:14,852
You being able to track our

2483
02:18:15,012 --> 02:18:17,017
inspection and rejections,

2484
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:20,637
get those into, one format,

2485
02:18:20,805 --> 02:18:23,705
one report, even the new fastball projects,

2486
02:18:24,161 --> 02:18:27,145
any rejections, so that they can quantify how to,

2487
02:18:27,146 --> 02:18:29,342
you know, areas that the most rejections,

2488
02:18:29,609 --> 02:18:34,257
so that we can use that as training towards employees of,

2489
02:18:34,866 --> 02:18:40,011
You have the power of many well-projections or government fit rejections,

2490
02:18:40,321 --> 02:18:42,280
you really need to button up a Yeah.

2491
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:50,389
That's, umm, that's exactly the part of the SCC guy.

2492
02:18:50,661 --> 02:18:53,188
Good. Good. That's why I did come on there.

2493
02:18:53,443 --> 02:18:58,386
I didn't want to ever feel anything. I had kind of some NCR

2494
02:18:58,387 --> 02:19:00,965
type of feel. You once they had to feel that. Dropped that,

2495
02:19:00,966 --> 02:19:04,241
you know, was this on the shooting issue, wasn't a bad computer issue,

2496
02:19:04,242 --> 02:19:06,516
wasn't it? What was it, you know? So,

2497
02:19:06,579 --> 02:19:09,820
that happened to me- You know, a train, basically a train analysis,

2498
02:19:09,821 --> 02:19:13,000
and you know, that's not fair. You put that in a temple somewhere?

2499
02:19:13,135 --> 02:19:15,456
Yeah, I didn't see how it was. All the action was- Yeah,

2500
02:19:15,457 --> 02:19:18,306
I didn't see ours in the temple,

2501
02:19:18,307 --> 02:19:20,362
in the inspections. What did we have? We have a train.

2502
02:19:20,363 --> 02:19:24,933
So. I had a inspection.

2503
02:19:24,934 --> 02:19:28,161
You wouldn't be one of our, one of our main ones here.

2504
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:35,063
That's my problem. So

2505
02:19:35,064 --> 02:19:37,805
are you wanting, uhm,

2506
02:19:37,806 --> 02:19:40,393
are you You Or are you just saying,

2507
02:19:41,448 --> 02:19:45,049
I have, uhm, I have like the ability to put that extra gear.

2508
02:19:45,145 --> 02:19:48,507
So, let's come in, I guess. Yes. That's,

2509
02:19:48,679 --> 02:19:50,715
that's what I'm not going to win.

2510
02:19:50,716 --> 02:19:54,148
I'd like to see if there's a report we can pull for,

2511
02:19:54,426 --> 02:19:57,559
for the reject. Yeah. That option is specifically whether it has to be invented

2512
02:19:57,579 --> 02:20:01,309
in each individual project. So I'm going to give you like a,

2513
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:03,918
a roller for the regret. Regents,

2514
02:20:04,027 --> 02:20:08,554
yep, so give back in to that. If you're ready to

2515
02:20:08,555 --> 02:20:11,191
record, let's go. I love you.

2516
02:20:11,192 --> 02:20:13,985
So give it up,

2517
02:20:13,986 --> 02:20:17,269
give it up, and then we have good records now here.

2518
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:21,357
Umm, see if we can get your f- where we want it to be,

2519
02:20:21,358 --> 02:20:24,634
right? So, uh, it shouldn't be filled with raw data.

2520
02:20:25,464 --> 02:20:27,585
So, uh, why would I give you one?

2521
02:20:27,586 --> 02:20:31,316
all If you wanted a specific child,

2522
02:20:31,317 --> 02:20:33,463
or you just want to, let's just do it across,

2523
02:20:33,478 --> 02:20:36,211
yeah. So, let's say, so you get okay. Okay.

2524
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:39,657
Okay. This is all fields that we

2525
02:20:39,658 --> 02:20:43,418
can filter based off of, because we've been able to see that.

2526
02:20:43,419 --> 02:20:46,767
Bye. And pull over your pass.

2527
02:20:47,633 --> 02:20:50,145
And okay, that's what I told. You know,

2528
02:20:50,734 --> 02:20:56,106
if you want to see the ones that- Yeah. That's how you

2529
02:20:56,107 --> 02:21:00,040
record stuff.

2530
02:21:00,041 --> 02:21:05,303
I'm going that. So, you're saying

2531
02:21:05,304 --> 02:21:07,445
we call that dad right here?

2532
02:21:07,446 --> 02:21:09,735
This is stuff that I would be interested in. They're not a sale,

2533
02:21:09,952 --> 02:21:12,432
and they're not starting to give it anything so it's not a sale.

2534
02:21:12,949 --> 02:21:15,671
What? What can make this even more?

2535
02:21:15,672 --> 02:21:20,434
Water. Helpful is when you have some videos,

2536
02:21:20,435 --> 02:21:22,527
like you're, you're talking about names properly,

2537
02:21:22,528 --> 02:21:24,935
about why they don't run up. I'll see you in D.F.

2538
02:21:24,936 --> 02:21:29,133
has some sort of a drop down deal with that display by the reason

2539
02:21:29,134 --> 02:21:32,191
why I type stuff. It makes it much easier.

2540
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:36,930
It's one of the trees. It's they're not really Rovo names to see what's

2541
02:21:36,931 --> 02:21:39,682
going on. If I could say, like, how you say it? and in the

2542
02:21:39,683 --> 02:21:44,450
next It's, like I said, but it's a machine there or a fabrication there

2543
02:21:44,451 --> 02:21:47,441
or it's a finger there or it's a detail there.

2544
02:21:47,442 --> 02:21:50,844
Thank you. And then I could be in, I could be in Spark C

2545
02:21:50,898 --> 02:21:54,678
and how many detail there is we've had at Puffetas and Shock.

2546
02:21:54,679 --> 02:21:57,018
How many machine there is we've had? Yeah. I mean,

2547
02:21:57,019 --> 02:22:00,805
faculty issues are more, cause I can feel it a little bit more easy,

2548
02:22:00,806 --> 02:22:03,139
rather than having to read all the notes. So,

2549
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:05,919
that's, That's more hope than that. So, like,

2550
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,528
for Bitbuck checks, it's like, did I put the clip in the right place?

2551
02:22:09,545 --> 02:22:12,419
You'd have an abbreviation for that? Yeah. Yup. Yeah.

2552
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:17,154
Yeah. For the well checks, I imagine you would put all the IP,

2553
02:22:17,387 --> 02:22:19,483
you know, in regard to all data, yes,

2554
02:22:19,484 --> 02:22:21,524
designation. nation. And there's drop downs.

2555
02:22:21,534 --> 02:22:24,571
Yeah. So if you set this,

2556
02:22:25,998 --> 02:22:30,030
will this or been? a The part removing,

2557
02:22:30,409 --> 02:22:34,506
if they don't fill it out. Not if they don't fill it out.

2558
02:22:34,507 --> 02:22:38,271
Now that if you fail it, they- I guess..

2559
02:22:38,564 --> 02:22:40,692
There's a- there's a of stuff,

2560
02:22:40,693 --> 02:22:42,935
and this is where you can't- you can't make up shit in the- it's

2561
02:22:42,936 --> 02:22:45,883
all fine, you know. So you can say that if they fail,

2562
02:22:46,155 --> 02:22:50,830
it really couldn't go well because it's not- it's still

2563
02:22:50,831 --> 02:22:53,958
the role of the violin. If you go on and it's flying and all

2564
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:56,345
the- all the way to the pan,

2565
02:22:56,359 --> 02:23:00,271
and you can- you can't share it, so. I'll one.

2566
02:23:05,209 --> 02:23:06,301
You know, say this didn't pass, do you want to keep going, and- and

2567
02:23:06,707 --> 02:23:09,666
anybody seems like- yeah. I remember to dissolve it.

2568
02:23:09,789 --> 02:23:13,939
Yes. Uh, yeah. There's a preventative,

2569
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:17,841
but not a dead end. and and it's just a taste of it,

2570
02:23:17,842 --> 02:23:22,455
but you're looking for more. So we've built it for all

2571
02:23:22,456 --> 02:23:25,119
the value of the shakers, all the values for the year that it did.

2572
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:27,317
Good. So,

2573
02:23:27,318 --> 02:23:31,832
here's

2574
02:23:31,833 --> 02:23:35,447
the card. the enemies today.

2575
02:23:37,213 --> 02:23:39,744
Mine, yes, and me. That's,

2576
02:23:40,433 --> 02:23:43,570
How does the Tristini activity is? Good. How much can we do that?

2577
02:23:43,571 --> 02:23:45,602
You should sit right there with Tom. Yeah,

2578
02:23:45,603 --> 02:23:48,043
he has, and Tom is a bee. He's better,

2579
02:23:48,044 --> 02:23:50,251
uh, QC diet, essentially. Absolutely.

2580
02:23:50,252 --> 02:23:52,637
And the bottom is going to be doing the economy a year ago,

2581
02:23:52,638 --> 02:23:55,162
uh, but any show up,

2582
02:23:55,163 --> 02:23:58,231
it's not. Uh, they're the first ones that,

2583
02:23:58,232 --> 02:24:02,626
Have access to it, and then out of talents for the last two or

2584
02:24:02,627 --> 02:24:05,252
three years, and, uh,

2585
02:24:05,262 --> 02:24:08,633
before we need the special, actions, and I'm marking these off,

2586
02:24:08,747 --> 02:24:12,003
having access to the drawings, to heavily,

2587
02:24:12,681 --> 02:24:15,171
only use what, In our drive,

2588
02:24:15,855 --> 02:24:17,990
drive box, and, for instance,

2589
02:24:17,991 --> 02:24:21,325
the latest revision, I don't even know if I'm bad,

2590
02:24:21,326 --> 02:24:23,819
I'm losing surprise. Right here. It hasn't been, um,

2591
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:25,984
the best thing I've ever tried is, uh,

2592
02:24:25,995 --> 02:24:28,287
you can go, yeah, uh, use your neck on,

2593
02:24:28,288 --> 02:24:30,921
uh, the first person who's- call and,

2594
02:24:30,922 --> 02:24:34,321
uh, uh, it was a lot of training at the LME.

2595
02:24:34,733 --> 02:24:37,494
So, were at least it, um,

2596
02:24:37,505 --> 02:24:39,757
already speaking. Thank you. So,

2597
02:24:39,984 --> 02:24:42,079
they used to have a, this,

2598
02:24:42,242 --> 02:24:44,537
this trailer that's over here, um,

2599
02:24:44,547 --> 02:24:47,201
that used to be really extreme. you be, uh,

2600
02:24:47,212 --> 02:24:49,963
ready in between the shop and the place, and,

2601
02:24:49,964 --> 02:24:52,313
uhm, they used to have a no key seat trailer,

2602
02:24:52,603 --> 02:24:54,755
but, uhm, yeah. You did that,

2603
02:24:54,756 --> 02:24:57,861
I saw it out of the way, and it was a small room to

2604
02:24:57,862 --> 02:25:00,514
go through that way, and put it in that.

2605
02:25:00,515 --> 02:25:02,613
But, here we go. So,

2606
02:25:02,614 --> 02:25:04,778
we're be one audience,

2607
02:25:04,779 --> 02:25:07,973
and we're going to have about shouts.

2608
02:25:08,653 --> 02:25:13,414
So, Midweek on Shout. We used to

2609
02:25:13,415 --> 02:25:17,274
have two, uhm, but it has to be able to be both hands and

2610
02:25:17,275 --> 02:25:22,032
hands and hands. Bye. I also know that some of the

2611
02:25:22,033 --> 02:25:25,105
leads, uhm, the partners' leads will be a little bit better.

2612
02:25:25,106 --> 02:25:28,293
I'm going to get tripped this way. Uh, so there I'll set up these

2613
02:25:28,294 --> 02:25:30,887
inspectors, and then we'll put their own Canadian columns,

2614
02:25:31,669 --> 02:25:35,525
and then we'll put them So, we'll put them So,

2615
02:25:35,526 --> 02:25:38,707
we know that it was going in its effect sheets, but I'm going to

2616
02:25:38,708 --> 02:25:42,271
look ahead to the rejection reports. Thanks your service.

2617
02:25:42,272 --> 02:25:45,864
Shred up, then I think you can see.

2618
02:25:47,656 --> 02:25:50,039
It's difficult. I went, I went to the chair,

2619
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:52,985
you know. I mean, I haven't got to say, they do have a drop

2620
02:25:52,986 --> 02:25:56,826
in. I mean, I haven't because you know,

2621
02:25:56,827 --> 02:26:01,372
that they, you know, like. What they bought because of everyone's without

2622
02:26:01,373 --> 02:26:03,410
very often getting changed. Yeah.

2623
02:26:03,429 --> 02:26:05,835
Does everybody get a little bit of a shut up? No, I'm sorry.

2624
02:26:05,836 --> 02:26:08,371
Thank you much. Well, it's a great video. It's uh,

2625
02:26:08,372 --> 02:26:12,888
uhm, they fill that out really

2626
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:15,967
when they pass it. you They have another video that they allow,

2627
02:26:15,968 --> 02:26:18,290
which was, here's one of the big things that I mean,

2628
02:26:18,291 --> 02:26:22,030
because here's one. Any other topics that I have.

2629
02:26:22,031 --> 02:26:26,642
So I. I have to

2630
02:26:26,643 --> 02:26:28,875
get to a bit of an extreme.

2631
02:26:28,876 --> 02:26:30,331
I was getting a clearer information about that. So if I didn't legislate. you

2632
02:26:30,332 --> 02:26:32,478
I was going to get that. So,

2633
02:26:32,658 --> 02:26:37,448
yeah, that's cool. You better also go and get some of it.

2634
02:26:37,449 --> 02:26:39,516
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And it's interesting.

2635
02:26:39,517 --> 02:26:43,423
Share all the goods. Yeah. That's a lot of the issue I had in

2636
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:46,281
my opinion. That was, you know, I saw him in a ski or something.

2637
02:26:46,282 --> 02:26:49,395
Okay. I had a lot of news,

2638
02:26:49,396 --> 02:26:51,863
but I just said,

2639
02:26:51,864 --> 02:26:54,096
uhm, I was recording bass. And then I saw the safety. It's like,

2640
02:26:54,097 --> 02:26:57,181
come on. We're not that perfect. And then you're not getting this thing to

2641
02:26:57,182 --> 02:27:00,904
do with balance. No, it's part of an issue we're having.

2642
02:27:00,905 --> 02:27:04,838
Uh. I'm not sure. The title of the summer is,

2643
02:27:04,839 --> 02:27:07,504
uh, let me take a look at it. And Marcus had a hell of

2644
02:27:07,505 --> 02:27:10,084
an abandoned house over here. Yeah,

2645
02:27:10,085 --> 02:27:12,439
buh. Bye! That's more work for me to do a film and then to

2646
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:14,740
read back and then to the past. And, uh,

2647
02:27:14,751 --> 02:27:17,140
I'm not always supposed to hold a new camera.

2648
02:27:17,785 --> 02:27:20,721
Okay. I'm not about things being rolled and screwed out.

2649
02:27:20,910 --> 02:27:23,390
I'm just, you know, I'm I'm like, I'm screwed up.

2650
02:27:23,391 --> 02:27:25,981
I'm like, I'm not screwed up. I'm like, I'll tell you what I'm saying.

2651
02:27:25,982 --> 02:27:28,358
I eat. You know, that's it. Okay. Well,

2652
02:27:28,359 --> 02:27:31,441
I don't think you see this. It'll circulate.

2653
02:27:31,944 --> 02:27:34,030
Not long enough. It'll get fixed.

2654
02:27:34,031 --> 02:27:36,687
Thanks. Yeah.

2655
02:27:36,688 --> 02:27:39,047
Yeah.

2656
02:27:39,048 --> 02:27:41,205
At least it's been fixed on Friday.

2657
02:27:41,583 --> 02:27:45,634
You know, it goes very calm and bizarre. We are. Yeah.

2658
02:27:46,062 --> 02:27:48,138
And the guy, you know,

2659
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:53,030
he would just flag it. We want visibility,

2660
02:27:53,031 --> 02:27:56,224
too. But then, he never put a consistent place to do it.

2661
02:27:56,225 --> 02:27:58,239
But if you get by, you know,

2662
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,351

2664
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:06,635
a little bit, a little bit of a.

2665
02:28:06,636 --> 02:28:09,571
Alrighty, see a little costume, look, some kind of man out there in their

2666
02:28:09,572 --> 02:28:11,985
own, because he, you know, but it's actually,

2667
02:28:12,111 --> 02:28:14,642
it's easy. It's a good system, it's a good system.

02:30:56,223 --> 02:30:59,586
Okay. Yes, but that would be really nice for that,

2716
02:30:59,587 --> 02:31:01,681
OpsGenie, for those three days.

2717
02:31:02,354 --> 02:31:11,014
Really good. Thank you. For

2718
02:31:11,019 --> 02:31:13,171
those drop-downs, we did it for this car.

2719
02:31:13,172 --> 02:31:16,210
. . U Twins, but those were standard air fans?

2720
02:31:16,211 --> 02:31:19,963
Umm, they were done staying at station passing,

2721
02:31:19,964 --> 02:31:22,149
they were a rest. There's a Catholic bill,

2722
02:31:22,150 --> 02:31:25,177
you know, but we want some, somebody in the building,

2723
02:31:25,178 --> 02:31:29,576
I suggest, and I've got that said. Thank you very much.

2724
02:31:29,577 --> 02:31:31,964
Yeah. Yeah,

2725
02:31:31,965 --> 02:31:34,225
I was just, uh, aws,

2726
02:31:34,226 --> 02:31:42,497
criteria there. Yeah. You Yeah,

2727
02:31:42,498 --> 02:31:44,739
really good working. Yeah. Yeah.

2728
02:31:45,042 --> 02:31:55,351
Yeah. You know. Yeah. Uh.

2729
02:31:55,352 --> 02:31:58,806
But I always want to listen to this experience,

2730
02:31:58,852 --> 02:32:01,289
and always be fun with the better of the community.

2731
02:32:02,027 --> 02:32:03,235
And I'm especially good.

2732
02:32:11,431 --> 02:32:14,884
It's too many great here.

2733
02:32:15,826 --> 02:32:20,895
Okay. Here we go in 5,000

2734
02:32:20,896 --> 02:32:25,509
or so. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. You got it

2735
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:29,371
now, I'm sure.

2736
02:32:29,372 --> 02:32:32,780
Yeah, we didn't have to see our log,

2737
02:32:32,781 --> 02:32:37,356
uh, our insulin loss to the smart sheets.

2738
02:32:37,357 --> 02:32:39,883
And, uh, the quality of the family,

2739
02:32:39,884 --> 02:32:41,819
you know, so you can look at all of that and put it in

2740
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:44,192
the stuff. Um, it's a lot.

2741
02:32:44,254 --> 02:32:46,488
Yeah, but we, Uh,

2742
02:32:46,499 --> 02:32:49,349
not in the sense of a bit hours, so we'll be in NCR and

2743
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:51,900
say, uh, maybe, uhm,

2744
02:32:51,911 --> 02:32:56,170
there's issues. You think it's obvious that these are the property that are connected

2745
02:32:56,171 --> 02:32:59,475
to the drug that is connected to the drug. So,

2746
02:32:59,945 --> 02:33:03,090
we'll see you in a minute, Mr. March. I'm Yeah,

2747
02:33:03,091 --> 02:33:05,710
I also read this picture. Also,

2748
02:33:05,711 --> 02:33:09,396
we're needing a copy of this picture.

2749
02:33:09,397 --> 02:33:11,644
. . I'm sure, me as well,

2750
02:33:11,645 --> 02:33:15,293
and how about this, uh,

2751
02:33:15,304 --> 02:33:17,371
and our other engine?

2752
02:33:17,372 --> 02:33:20,820
. . . . . . Good. Cheers.

2753
02:33:25,831 --> 02:33:27,937
Thank you.

2754
02:33:27,938 --> 02:33:29,339
Thank

2755
02:33:33,871 --> 02:33:36,073
Each NCR,

2756
02:33:36,074 --> 02:33:39,908
so again 55 NCR is in 22,

2757
02:33:39,909 --> 02:33:41,916
22. We'll one.

2758
02:33:41,917 --> 02:33:44,798
23, 39,

2759
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:47,680
24, 41.

2760
02:33:47,685 --> 02:33:49,956
Good one.

2761
02:33:49,957 --> 02:33:52,094
So we can do this,

2762
02:33:52,095 --> 02:33:54,291
uh, and, uh,

2763
02:33:54,301 --> 02:33:56,567
fix it again. He's kind of down to the areas of that.

2764
02:33:56,568 --> 02:33:59,196
But, uh, Mhm. So, uh,

2765
02:33:59,206 --> 02:34:01,600
it matters. No one else is seeing NCR.

2766
02:34:01,601 --> 02:34:03,647
No, no, no, no, no, no,

2767
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:06,036
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thanks.

2768
02:34:06,037 --> 02:34:11,181
I'm just leave you here. What happens? And they don't freakin' else first.

2769
02:34:11,182 --> 02:34:15,958
Yes. I

2770
02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:18,226
had some freaking burdens in speed.

2771
02:34:18,798 --> 02:34:21,172
So always, very good to see you now.

2772
02:34:21,173 --> 02:34:25,279
Get your Thank You know, it's just comfortable.

2773
02:34:25,425 --> 02:34:29,068
What is this great about you? Umm, it's just like that.

2774
02:34:29,069 --> 02:34:31,761
This is. This is the, uh,

2775
02:34:31,771 --> 02:34:34,896
this is the, uh, program that, uh,

2776
02:34:34,906 --> 02:34:37,002
most of the, uh, they do all their, their,

2777
02:34:37,003 --> 02:34:39,332
their inspections in. Thank But, um,

2778
02:34:39,342 --> 02:34:43,386
setbacks, we have all of these non-conformants reports.

2779
02:34:43,552 --> 02:34:45,575
I'm not broken out in there, so.

2780
02:34:45,576 --> 02:34:47,841
Let's go. I heard it was going to be like that this week,

2781
02:34:47,842 --> 02:34:50,853
so I'm going to be able get it done.

2782
02:34:50,854 --> 02:34:52,906
Did you guys, could you say it was going to be okay?

2783
02:34:52,907 --> 02:34:56,499
Uh, then it's not anything built, man. Thank you. But, uh,

2784
02:34:56,510 --> 02:34:59,315
cool, so all of what is getting us from the KTA,

2785
02:34:59,356 --> 02:35:02,311
which I've been wanting to replace in it.

2786
02:35:02,312 --> 02:35:05,984
It does not have the same level of functionality,

2787
02:35:05,985 --> 02:35:10,746
so, uhm, you know, currently you're still about excited about And

2788
02:35:11,427 --> 02:35:16,109
then the other area we're hoping to catch from them from what

2789
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:18,396
supports is, uhm. Come on.

2790
02:35:18,397 --> 02:35:20,767
Two-pass station, shot-related items.

2791
02:35:21,482 --> 02:35:23,985
You take all the single-pig triggers of my equipment.

2792
02:35:24,275 --> 02:35:26,496
You may have, not, with only the points, I'm set up.

2793
02:35:26,497 --> 02:35:29,018
In there, and, uhm,

2794
02:35:29,028 --> 02:35:31,348
hey. So, all of that is documented.

2795
02:35:31,529 --> 02:35:33,854
So, then, we're going to attach some of this, which this is going to

2796
02:35:34,077 --> 02:35:37,976
be. Bye And, uhm, and, and then,

2797
02:35:38,181 --> 02:35:41,456
it's going to be set up together. Okay, and with that,

2798
02:35:41,457 --> 02:35:46,712
I use a window that, Yeah, so, uh,

2799
02:35:46,723 --> 02:35:49,868
this one, this one while I haven't tried playing with the adding in there.

2800
02:35:49,869 --> 02:35:52,705
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I think this is something that we know,

2801
02:35:54,186 --> 02:35:56,192
that I can put in there. We've got a picture in there, and a

2802
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:58,596
table, and the picture isn't that really in the table.

2803
02:35:58,597 --> 02:36:00,023
Yeah. Yeah.

2804
02:36:04,239 --> 02:36:06,636
Yeah. The last thing I want to do is follow me.

2805
02:36:12,432 --> 02:36:14,671
I don't know. I don't know. Okay, we're talking about it,

2806
02:36:14,672 --> 02:36:18,365
You know, like, a project in New York and in each section,

2807
02:36:18,366 --> 02:36:20,759
you know, you know, like your own. So,

2808
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:22,988
your, your dish could be, You know,

2809
02:36:22,989 --> 02:36:25,054
it great because everybody shot this bet,

2810
02:36:25,187 --> 02:36:29,706
but your control of the revisions was great because it came down

2811
02:36:29,707 --> 02:36:34,094
over any of the waves. You know, when you get drawings on that job,

2812
02:36:34,095 --> 02:36:38,092
you're going to pull that section of the manual and only get the latest.

2813
02:36:38,093 --> 02:36:41,371
We'll see you week. You know, and I actually,

2814
02:36:41,372 --> 02:36:43,872
I don't even start using a thing because it does all the pads,

2815
02:36:43,873 --> 02:36:46,836
but I'll be like, okay, alright. Otherwise.

2816
02:36:46,837 --> 02:36:51,592
That's actually a good idea. I'm not buying

2817
02:36:51,593 --> 02:36:53,991
a singer at someone because I love the distribution.

2818
02:36:53,992 --> 02:36:56,769
You should be able to control what, uh,

2819
02:36:56,779 --> 02:36:58,845
revision time would be. That's, that's,

2820
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:01,253
that's actually a real good idea.

2821
02:37:01,254 --> 02:37:03,694
That's it. And if,

2822
02:37:03,695 --> 02:37:06,599
if, if nobody is looking to build up some flair in it,

2823
02:37:07,124 --> 02:37:09,510
then we'll be able to get it to quality really.

2824
02:37:09,758 --> 02:37:12,735
So. . . Ehm,

2825
02:37:12,736 --> 02:37:17,237
I and we do have some time to support anything for a shop beggar,

2826
02:37:17,238 --> 02:37:21,043
a shop , . I'm not sure I'm willing to get following any of

2827
02:37:21,044 --> 02:37:23,912
this. I can be a family that's because of the personal person,

2828
02:37:23,913 --> 02:37:26,002
the son of this bag. Yeah. And then, eh, eh, ehm,

2829
02:37:26,003 --> 02:37:29,005
ehm, it was easily accessible on the second.

2830
02:37:29,609 --> 02:37:32,474
Yeah. Go grab your, your cheese and bottle.

2831
02:37:32,475 --> 02:37:36,150
Thank you. Be pretty hopeful.

2832
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:38,538
But yeah, that sometimes,

2833
02:37:38,726 --> 02:37:42,473
or there's a fairly key to the body control as the legs,

2834
02:37:42,629 --> 02:37:46,107
and I don't know. So, uh,

2835
02:37:46,118 --> 02:37:49,354
we've only got one fail, and we've only got two passes,

2836
02:37:49,355 --> 02:37:52,523
and then you go. . Yeah,

2837
02:37:52,524 --> 02:37:55,328
I have more,

2838
02:37:55,329 --> 02:37:59,191
umm.

2839
02:37:59,192 --> 02:38:01,963
. . . Hispanic, uh,

2840
02:38:01,974 --> 02:38:04,831
Inspector, that didn't not fail, they said it has.

2841
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:07,231
Oh, boy, come on.

2842
02:38:07,232 --> 02:38:09,251
Oh, dude. Yeah, yeah, Hey,

2843
02:38:09,252 --> 02:38:11,795
hey, what's up? It's not any .

2844
02:38:11,796 --> 02:38:14,055
. that's your job. Yeah, because that .

2845
02:38:14,056 --> 02:38:23,280
. that's right. You . .

2846
02:38:23,281 --> 02:38:25,906
. Yeah, well, happy jobs.

2847
02:38:27,672 --> 02:38:37,874
Alright. Hit

2848
02:38:37,875 --> 02:38:39,948
it in a cone 3D team to go home. No. With,

2849
02:38:39,949 --> 02:38:42,960
uhm, shipping guys, as we would see that experience,

2850
02:38:42,961 --> 02:38:44,992
mine.org. So,

2851
02:38:44,993 --> 02:38:47,551
uhm, it's to her, keeping that up pretty well.

2852
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:50,803
So, I go through it a little bit. Two more times,

2853
02:38:51,336 --> 02:38:54,172
the biggest issue in the internet can be developed with it.

2854
02:38:54,173 --> 02:38:56,390
Stay safe. We'll be here. Uh,

2855
02:38:56,401 --> 02:38:59,263
you're out there and you're gonna throw it back in.

2856
02:38:59,276 --> 02:39:01,999
So, I'm standing on the yard. Couldn't be long.

2857
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,099
Didn't you say that last time. Ooh. . . And then,

2858
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:07,496
uh, second walk back in here is a quick video.

2859
02:39:07,607 --> 02:39:12,388
Unaductant. Well, it's like seem to work out- I'm not one,

2860
02:39:12,389 --> 02:39:15,201
but, are there any,

2861
02:39:15,202 --> 02:39:20,859
uh, access points that are from H here that I'll- I

2862
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:24,304
mean, you're here, Phil. Um, uhm,

2863
02:39:24,314 --> 02:39:26,500
it's out of bias. Uh,

2864
02:39:26,511 --> 02:39:29,454
yeah, it's out here. There. Uh, but we have a fair octave line here.

2865
02:39:29,455 --> 02:39:31,880
It's good. I was in the center of the yard at the best center

2866
02:39:31,881 --> 02:39:35,236
of the two shops, and it was, it was pointless there.

2867
02:39:35,242 --> 02:39:38,922
Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting ready just barely scraping,

2868
02:39:39,403 --> 02:39:42,622
and then, and then, as we bark further out,

2869
02:39:42,773 --> 02:39:45,838
cause I'm pretty sure we all. . We also have one big corner by

2870
02:39:45,839 --> 02:39:52,510
our glass theory, and so we have a whole little So

2871
02:39:52,527 --> 02:39:54,939
I think by the way, we need to extend the raise on those.

2872
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:58,911
Umm, the other thing here, you know, IT is getting a dedicated solid.

2873
02:39:58,912 --> 02:40:03,480
I love Right out there, because we're already operating

2874
02:40:03,481 --> 02:40:07,831
and starting anyways. So, um, yeah. Umm, here's where we're going.

2875
02:40:07,832 --> 02:40:10,475
If you can, if you if I know you're a champion,

2876
02:40:10,476 --> 02:40:12,826
you shouldn't be able to have one later,

2877
02:40:12,827 --> 02:40:15,705
right? Yeah. Yeah. Bye! Bye!

2878
02:40:15,706 --> 02:40:19,514
Got it. I actually, for a while, I had a,

2879
02:40:19,515 --> 02:40:21,837
uhm, it was a really cheap one, but it was,

2880
02:40:21,838 --> 02:40:26,363
uhm, this, it was- built for usage on farms,

2881
02:40:26,707 --> 02:40:30,392
from where you could have a life. I, I have some that it would

2882
02:40:30,393 --> 02:40:32,491
be one literally set in Turkey. Thank you.

2883
02:40:32,315 --> 02:40:34,879
You can, uh, wildlife for a mile,

2884
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:37,396
if you can see straight. It's very,

2885
02:40:37,397 --> 02:40:40,157
it's very cheap. Uh.

2886
02:40:40,168 --> 02:40:42,859
Oh. But, from the Parks League lawyers,

2887
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:47,221
I actually really did. That's what you know about the system,

2888
02:40:47,222 --> 02:40:49,429
really. We changed. I mentioned that, you know,

2889
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:51,633
Board of Stays, but I had no trouble in it, but,

2890
02:40:51,988 --> 02:40:54,610

2912
02:41:52,341 --> 02:41:55,895
We'll see in a second. All the time. Some of the people are working

2913
02:41:55,896 --> 02:41:59,273
to that. Some of us are actually on a heap number two.

2914
02:41:59,995 --> 02:42:03,695
Yeah, that one we got this one. morning. So, hey,

2919
02:42:14,833 --> 02:42:16,879

02:42:28,059 --> 02:42:30,609
Oh, okay. But, you guys, that's right. I think you figured it out.

2925
02:42:31,211 --> 02:42:33,435
You guys, it's so mean, documented all the heat numbers. That's going to We'll

2926

02:42:39,034 --> 02:42:43,257
Yeah. So. Oh. Is that what you let go of?

2929
02:42:43,258 --> 02:42:46,920
Is right, is right, is right, is is Everything is a heat number,

2930
02:42:46,921 --> 02:42:49,596
a heat number, a number, a heat number, a heat number, a heat number.

2931
02:42:49,597 --> 02:42:51,612
And then the purchase for their number.

2932
02:42:52,129 --> 02:42:54,297
So, yeah, it's, it gets,

2933
02:42:54,441 --> 02:42:56,596
since I've already gotten them, we're just, are really deep.

2934
02:42:56,597 --> 02:42:59,442
Thank Unique, you can go.

2935
02:42:59,982 --> 02:43:04,650

2936
02:43:04,651 --> 02:43:06,980
the purchase. Thank your support. So, uhm,

2937
02:43:06,990 --> 02:43:11,039

2938
02:43:11,131 --> 02:43:13,601
some of these new channels. our beliefs.

2939
02:43:13,602 --> 02:43:16,744
uh, uhm,

2940
02:43:16,755 --> 02:43:19,893

2941
02:43:19,894 --> 02:43:22,305
Okay. Okay. But going to do just so.

2942
02:43:23,544 --> 02:43:27,370
In reference to the line information right on top of the bit and then

2943
02:43:27,458 --> 02:43:29,611
as the operators are.

2944
02:43:29,612 --> 02:43:33,723
Now it's the same songs, they're cutting off the heat number,

2945
02:43:33,724 --> 02:43:36,131
so I have to reach for this information better at it,

2946
02:43:36,132 --> 02:43:39,743
uh, peace. Thanks. So much,

2947
02:43:40,009 --> 02:43:43,141

2955
02:44:05,963 --> 02:44:10,366
pretty quickly if you have a good idea. I don't So,

2978
02:45:56,644 --> 02:45:59,053

a part of our procedure that, uh, uhm, uhm, uhm,

2988
02:46:27,543 --> 02:46:29,985
I don't really want to know in monthly. Please. Because,

2989
02:46:30,665 --> 02:46:32,831
some months ago, I have a hundred people,

2990
02:46:32,832 --> 02:46:35,570
purchase orders, so someone's moved out of 12.

2991
02:46:35,571 --> 02:46:39,419
So, why haven't took a day before- I can't really see you,

2992
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:41,625
I'm already at the end of the week. It's definitely you, or,

2993
02:46:41,626 --> 02:46:46,430
umm, anyone that receives all storage- So going In the

2994
02:46:46,431 --> 02:46:49,581
chat forums. So I don't know if it's a bit of a shoot that

2995
02:46:49,582 --> 02:46:53,257
you're receiving. Oh, that's you, but you only receive Bitbucket once after- That was

2996
02:46:53,258 --> 02:46:55,402
the interesting. Now,

2997
02:46:55,423 --> 02:46:57,426
I'm not on the site and reference back to it,

2998
02:46:57,543 --> 02:47:00,931
and I'm not a customer who's requesting the birth of material received.

2999
02:47:00,932 --> 02:47:04,389
See you. For payment, uhh,

3000
02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:06,815
a couple of our customers will do that,

3001
02:47:07,129 --> 02:47:09,631
but there's a payment, put it in the token.

3002
02:47:09,632 --> 02:47:12,616
. Yeah, it's the same, we're going to be able to do it in

3003
02:47:12,617 --> 02:47:14,824
here, and we're going to do it in T.R.

3004
02:47:14,825 --> 02:47:17,367
and MediRoute. Where are some of us are messed up?

3005
02:47:17,368 --> 02:47:20,609
See ya. Yeah, look from the desk outside.

3006
02:47:21,317 --> 02:47:23,517
So that is a little receiving in the yard.

3007
02:47:23,565 --> 02:47:25,651
Please don't see anything else in the box.

3008
02:47:25,652 --> 02:47:28,306
All scans in, all of the,

3009
02:47:28,307 --> 02:47:31,281
uh, receivers, yeah, pulls in the TRs from,

3010
02:47:31,282 --> 02:47:33,691
uh, physically back to the MTRs.

3011
02:47:33,692 --> 02:47:38,224
. In the TRs, the pull of a seat for that A into the

3012
02:47:38,225 --> 02:47:40,499
full B. What we're afraid of, you have found a lot of that.

3013
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:42,709
I don't believe it. You can do all that,

3014
02:47:42,710 --> 02:47:45,413
and that's kind of the feeling of the field.

3015
02:47:45,748 --> 02:47:48,407
We've received it. We've asked them to be ours.

3016
02:47:48,444 --> 02:47:53,058
I think so. But. I haven't yet since finalized in the process.

3017
02:47:53,059 --> 02:47:56,704
You really can't doubt me. It's our correct question.

3018
02:47:56,705 --> 02:48:01,505
So today, right, but otherwise your system gets all

3019
02:48:01,506 --> 02:48:03,817
in zero quantities. System about it.

3020
02:48:03,818 --> 02:48:06,283
Do it. A lot of people use it. For some,

3021
02:48:07,031 --> 02:48:09,168
maybe, you know, like,

3022
02:48:09,169 --> 02:48:12,542
uhm, the reason I asked, you got to pay for it back is,

3023
02:48:12,896 --> 02:48:15,634
if you found one. I what it's back for you. You ever saw a

3024
02:48:15,635 --> 02:48:17,690
little thing that wasn't on us, and I asked him,

3025
02:48:17,691 --> 02:48:19,709
or she, you may be able to pay for it back in you.

3026
02:48:20,007 --> 02:48:23,656
Yeah, uhm. Bye. I just think we're leaving some sort of something over the

3027
02:48:23,657 --> 02:48:27,385
weekend, so. But yeah,

3028
02:48:27,386 --> 02:48:29,676
yeah, everything good. I'd be able to see these in the process.

3029
02:48:29,677 --> 02:48:32,651
Nah, I definitely would not be close to us.

3030
02:48:32,652 --> 02:48:35,472
Yeah, cause I don't know if we were able to catch them beyond this.

3031
02:48:36,014 --> 02:48:38,364
I mean, it's just been two more- clips.

3032
02:48:38,603 --> 02:48:43,112
So, yeah, the only thing that's starting to see that we're going to need

3033
02:48:43,113 --> 02:48:45,691
to, uhm.

3034
02:48:45,692 --> 02:48:48,650
So, I'm pulling the lathe and putting this people forward,

3035
02:48:48,651 --> 02:48:51,097
and then lining up a job,

3036
02:48:51,098 --> 02:48:53,256
uhm, from my process plate.

3037
02:48:53,257 --> 02:48:58,243
Ready? So, uhm, in orders on Tuesdays and

3038
02:48:58,244 --> 02:49:01,711
Thursdays every week.

3039
02:49:01,712 --> 02:49:04,026
But you can follow us in front of it.

3040
02:49:04,264 --> 02:49:07,544
Why not? Yeah. So, if you get- if maybe you follow us in front

3041
02:49:07,608 --> 02:49:09,691
in front of us when we do that, I'll leave you soon.

3042
02:49:09,692 --> 02:49:12,383
If you a receipt, you would be following us. Shouldn't I get it?

3043
02:49:12,384 --> 02:49:14,708
Another ship? And next week, you follow us.

3044
02:49:14,709 --> 02:49:17,395
It's really hard to do the following us. There are other dragons in here.

3045
02:49:17,396 --> 02:49:20,871
Good. Good. Keep it in and out the process is forward to it all.

3046
02:49:21,601 --> 02:49:24,663
This panel can be a revitalized line by line.

3047
02:49:24,702 --> 02:49:26,835
So, yeah. Good. Good. Nah,

3048
02:49:26,836 --> 02:49:27,530
that was stupid. Yeah. Thank you.

3049
02:49:34,651 --> 02:49:37,793
Or,

3050
02:49:37,799 --> 02:49:39,926
like, I said, you can figure out that, ah, ah,

3051
02:49:39,932 --> 02:49:43,500
keep it, you said it, do it. And we'll see you next once a

3052
02:49:43,501 --> 02:49:48,162
week or something, but, yeah. I think they've

3053
02:49:48,163 --> 02:49:50,410
got a, they've got they've got an option.

3054
02:49:50,411 --> 02:49:52,796
Thank you, everyone. I'm like, I don't know about the biggest process.

3055
02:49:52,797 --> 02:49:55,760
That sort of is no importance. Yeah.

3056
02:49:55,256 --> 02:49:55,760
Yeah.

3057
02:50:02,972 --> 02:50:06,328
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, in an iterative, that side is pushed as

3058
02:50:06,329 --> 02:50:08,529
for the, You know, you can make it against things that say, I never

3059
02:50:08,530 --> 02:50:11,294
had to do it. Later, I had to do it.

3060
02:50:12,091 --> 02:50:14,383
That's, it's a big while, I'm not doing it.

3061
02:50:14,384 --> 02:50:18,931
I'll back I'm just

3062
02:50:18,932 --> 02:50:21,319
going to do it.

3063
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:24,916
I'm just going to do it. Bye-bye. I didn't necessarily add anything,

3064
02:50:24,917 --> 02:50:29,393
uhh, with a quick ending that we have there,

3065
02:50:29,570 --> 02:50:31,668
but that's kind of something that- I'm gonna do anything,

3066
02:50:32,515 --> 02:50:34,715
estimate by estimate basis, yup.

3067
02:50:35,221 --> 02:50:38,340
We're gonna do just some of this, which is pretty great. Have evening.

3068
02:50:38,341 --> 02:50:41,102
Have a good All right. Here's your Bye. Let's go. We're gonna do, umm,

3069
02:50:41,103 --> 02:50:44,037
the semi-retic presence is the main portly.

3070
02:50:44,266 --> 02:50:46,337
Yeah. Pretty pretty. So,

3071
02:50:46,338 --> 02:50:49,598
um. Go. Go. That's,

3072
02:50:49,599 --> 02:50:53,993
that's, uh, always along with anybody. There's always very similar reason to create one.

3073
02:50:53,994 --> 02:50:56,547
Alright. That's, that's,

3074
02:50:57,567 --> 02:51:01,804
that's it. Nice guys, gorgeous. This, You know,

3075
02:51:01,805 --> 02:51:05,722
we didn't have to face any of that,

3076
02:51:06,612 --> 02:51:08,622
but the main,

3077
02:51:09,310 --> 02:51:14,010
the main, The reason that was on here is because they

3078
02:51:14,011 --> 02:51:17,593
wanted face coats in here,

3079
02:51:18,008 --> 02:51:21,389
time and time. You very wants to experience this,

3080
02:51:21,390 --> 02:51:23,822
uh, and that's not, that's not, that's not,

3081
02:51:24,521 --> 02:51:26,882
that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not.

3082
02:51:26,883 --> 02:51:29,007
Love you. I'm assuming you do ask that.

3083
02:51:29,008 --> 02:51:31,126
It's not about you, it's the end.

3084
02:51:31,634 --> 02:51:34,957
So, okay, I think it says that I broke it out by these pairs.

3085
02:51:34,958 --> 02:51:37,378
those. So, let me put it in this,

3086
02:51:37,379 --> 02:51:40,859
right? If you put it, if you put it in 10,

3087
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:42,955
the template just gives you that break. No,

3088
02:51:42,956 --> 02:51:45,860
I guess. . You know, you can start, and you can only do it

3089
02:51:45,861 --> 02:51:47,939
pulling out like, all that panic.

3090
02:51:48,463 --> 02:51:50,728
You can just do it, too.

3091
02:51:50,729 --> 02:51:55,388
You will be here. The other part of it is, uhm, these animals have

3092
02:51:55,389 --> 02:51:59,371
a really, really big job as to who tends to hate, uhm. Go ahead.

3093
02:51:59,372 --> 02:52:01,589
Go ahead. Each area, of course,

3094
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:05,150
and then we did ready to comment station for,

3095
02:52:05,151 --> 02:52:07,411
uh, maybe a little bit of all being free.

3096
02:52:07,412 --> 02:52:09,495
99, 1000, forward,

3097
02:52:09,496 --> 02:52:12,661
dock, river, but in each area within 39,

3098
02:52:12,662 --> 02:52:14,759
1001, 300 times in 2,

3099
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:20,373
300. Good. It's just gonna throw

3100
02:52:20,374 --> 02:52:23,380
up 3001,000.

3101
02:52:23,381 --> 02:52:26,252
. Yeah, but it would give you,

3102
02:52:26,253 --> 02:52:30,235
it would give you a shot.

3103
02:52:30,236 --> 02:52:32,309
You would have to, right?

3104
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:34,549
And then you could, so,

3105
02:52:35,315 --> 02:52:37,757
the three non-1000,

3106
02:52:37,758 --> 02:52:40,290
one, are you, are you fine? I'm sure you can have them if you're

3107
02:52:40,291 --> 02:52:43,319
on your best limits right now so that you can,

3108
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:47,019
if you're having to split it out by that.

3109
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:49,455
So, essentially, my- I mean,

3110
02:52:49,456 --> 02:52:51,895
if you're better than one of the estimate, for example, labor,

3111
02:52:52,273 --> 02:52:55,032
yeah, the biggest thing in a lot of times, uhh,

3112
02:52:55,043 --> 02:52:58,828
well. If I can pull uhh,

3113
02:52:58,839 --> 02:53:01,819
this was a job for the biggest animal.

3114
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:03,691
on board.

3115
02:53:27,811 --> 02:53:32,811
Uhh.

3116
02:53:35,851 --> 02:53:40,351
So, like, this one is heavy and missing.

3117
02:53:40,352 --> 02:53:43,560
It's not also both skills. It's so many different styles.

3118
02:53:43,561 --> 02:53:45,618
So. It's not the same style of the mission.

3119
02:53:46,066 --> 02:53:49,931
No, not. So, like, they have ladders broken,

3120
02:53:49,932 --> 02:53:52,167
especially with the United States, broken. So,

3121
02:53:52,334 --> 02:53:54,639
they, they, uhm, stay at the dock.

3122
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:57,285
That was one of those, the dock got from a red sheet.

3123
02:53:57,570 --> 02:53:59,976
Retaining walls, retaining walls of red sheets.

3124
02:53:59,977 --> 02:54:04,928
. So, each of these different breakouts will cast a different

3125
02:54:05,132 --> 02:54:07,696
code associated with it. Yes,

3126
02:54:07,697 --> 02:54:11,268
each of you. These have their own, their own neighborhood budget.

3127
02:54:11,269 --> 02:54:13,396
So, right. When they break it out,

3128
02:54:13,683 --> 02:54:15,917
they keep those, they keep it separate.

3129
02:54:15,918 --> 02:54:15,880
I'm sure.

3130
02:54:21,942 --> 02:54:24,096
So, you are having to be able to break that out. Yeah. So, if,

3131
02:54:24,097 --> 02:54:29,233
If the goal is to keep everything in 10,

3132
02:54:29,234 --> 02:54:32,029
then you need to break that out with the intent.

3133
02:54:32,030 --> 02:54:34,221
Good. So, you know, the Thanksgiving,

3134
02:54:34,222 --> 02:54:37,477
the Thanksgiving's here and there, the costumes,

3135
02:54:37,906 --> 02:54:40,171
they, uh, at the end of the day.

3136
02:54:40,172 --> 02:54:42,588
So, if you get a break, like, break that allowance,

3137
02:54:42,605 --> 02:54:45,275
even being what the face can do is the rest of the house.

3138
02:54:45,441 --> 02:54:47,429
It's a good place to do it, I'm glad you're very glad you're not

3139
02:54:47,499 --> 02:54:50,693
in front of this place. So, I'm a partnership with Ian.

3140
02:54:51,667 --> 02:54:54,767
Okay, Ian. Uhm, Bismarck. And so, Ian,

3141
02:54:54,898 --> 02:54:58,762
with Ian Jackbud. you You know, it's very expensive.

3142
02:54:58,763 --> 02:55:01,508
It's, it's, it's cost. Oh, yeah, I'm okay to take it.

3143
02:55:01,763 --> 02:55:03,960
Now, so I'm going to want it to save. So, I'm having to use

3144
02:55:03,961 --> 02:55:06,194
all of this. So, you can, you can, you can,

3145
02:55:06,195 --> 02:55:11,880
you can either always. Thank much.

3146
02:55:11,881 --> 02:55:13,945
Thank you so much. You are welcome. You can do that right,

3147
02:55:13,946 --> 02:55:16,623
or you can do a lot, a lot,

3148
02:55:16,624 --> 02:55:20,371
a lot of bases inside. This one.

3149
02:55:20,372 --> 02:55:23,704
The other line is this costume. And when you do that,

3150
02:55:23,830 --> 02:55:26,231
that thing, once you finish, you're asking that,

3151
02:55:26,731 --> 02:55:28,848
you, you can just, Thanks watching! It's like,

3152
02:55:28,849 --> 02:55:31,658
sure about this, but, uhm, when I post it,

3153
02:55:31,659 --> 02:55:33,812
it'll give you the breakdown of that, so,

3154
02:55:33,813 --> 02:55:36,456
The other story, you gotta know that, right? I'm gonna go.

3155
02:55:36,457 --> 02:55:40,273
So, if anything would kinda make sense to set it up in there,

3156
02:55:40,797 --> 02:55:44,805
if we're going to say we're gonna take every day in the order- I'm

3157
02:55:44,806 --> 02:55:48,481
gonna wrap it up with a pet.

3158
02:55:48,882 --> 02:55:55,234
Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Okay. And

3159
02:55:55,235 --> 02:55:58,114
that's, uh, in many minutes and in past many minutes.

3160
02:55:58,115 --> 02:56:05,046
Thank you Yeah,

3161
02:56:05,061 --> 02:56:08,871
in past few minutes. Thank you very much.

3162
02:56:08,872 --> 02:56:13,878
So that's where you would send it up and possibly the universal area within

3163
02:56:13,879 --> 02:56:15,996
estimating the site. Okay,

3164
02:56:16,213 --> 02:56:20,593
this cost. Hello. The cost code pertains to this particular labor,

3165
02:56:20,594 --> 02:56:23,510
or material, or galvanizing,

3166
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:24,182
or like. Okay, bye.

3167
02:56:33,811 --> 02:56:36,180
I agree Thank you.

3168
02:56:41,791 --> 02:56:46,791
So

3169
02:56:49,087 --> 02:56:51,383
it's all condensed- Thank you. Yeah, it's going to be your shot in half.

3170
02:56:52,811 --> 02:56:53,217
Yeah.

3171
02:56:58,831 --> 02:57:03,031
That's uh,

3172
02:57:03,032 --> 02:57:01,390
Okay.

3173
02:57:14,851 --> 02:57:18,234
So you live in that costume.

3174
02:57:19,245 --> 02:57:21,280
I don't know if it's the only one thing. But,

3175
02:57:21,281 --> 02:57:23,892
I should be living in . Okay,

3176
02:57:23,893 --> 02:57:26,872
you're good. Okay.

3177
02:57:28,472 --> 02:57:34,477
Thank you. Okay.

3178
02:57:34,916 --> 02:57:44,490
Good morning. Thank you. Okay.

3179
02:57:44,491 --> 02:57:44,799
to do.

3180
02:57:56,851 --> 02:58:01,851
and

3181
02:58:04,098 --> 02:58:06,907
here I have a- Yes, I'm not going to do this,

3182
02:58:06,908 --> 02:58:11,759
dude. I wouldn't be put back

3183
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,337
in my category, son. I'm not going do this Hey,

3184
02:58:15,338 --> 02:58:19,229
you sure didn't even feel that you're not going to do this,

3185
02:58:19,230 --> 02:58:21,276
you know. Cause, uh, I'm not quite sure.

3186
02:58:21,277 --> 02:58:24,294
You're not going to have to be able to break out in the twenty

3187
02:58:24,295 --> 02:58:27,535
twenty-six. Are you going to make things out?

3188
02:58:27,536 --> 02:58:31,769
Yeah. But I think they're doing it by- I think they're going categories,

3189
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:34,970
so category page, page category.

3190
02:58:35,338 --> 02:58:37,466
I think they're going to be able to break out by all the- I

3191
02:58:37,597 --> 02:58:39,908
don't know if they're accustomed to, but,

3192
02:58:40,327 --> 02:58:44,170
I mean, that- since it's not literally going to be able to pull over

3193
02:58:44,171 --> 02:58:48,878
in this way anyway. You're just going to never afford to put

3194
02:58:48,879 --> 02:58:51,479
it in this, uhh, engagement with OpsGenie,

3195
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:54,204
uuuh. Here we go. You Okay,

3196
02:58:54,374 --> 02:58:59,077
and that might be part of why the union is also

3197
02:58:59,078 --> 02:59:01,401
part of the union, honestly. Totally.

3198
02:59:01,402 --> 02:59:03,719
you I'm killing pro-bore. Yeah,

3199
02:59:04,074 --> 02:59:08,480
just pro-bore. Um, like, I mean, this is, is. I this.

3200
02:59:08,481 --> 02:59:12,384
I hope that you can explore where that's the good thing you see to

3201
02:59:12,385 --> 02:59:15,119
do. Except, yup. And, uh, this, this is also a cloud.

3202
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:17,200
All'all.

3203
02:59:17,201 --> 02:59:19,371
All right. We're getting more new business.

3204
02:59:20,209 --> 02:59:25,463
So, they'll re-map it and pay a sense for being used this

3205
02:59:25,464 --> 02:59:29,495
for- Or, I'm going to have a second page,

3206
02:59:29,822 --> 02:59:32,204
and then add a Facebook line item in,

3207
02:59:32,562 --> 02:59:35,251
and then these. issues. 7 Same thing there, yep,

3208
02:59:35,262 --> 02:59:36,830

3209
02:59:41,671 --> 02:59:46,671

3212
02:59:53,716 --> 02:59:56,149
excavated while I stay. Thanks for being here.

3213
02:59:56,388 --> 02:59:59,276
I will. Hey. You do get a little tech club,

3214
02:59:59,467 --> 03:00:01,707
so that's the fact of which you can get rid of.

3215
03:00:38,011 --> 03:00:40,770
Uhh.

3216
03:00:40,781 --> 03:00:43,844
Perfect, thank you, help. Good to hear anything.

3217
03:00:43,845 --> 03:00:44,185
Okay.

3218
03:01:18,151 --> 03:01:23,151
Other

3219
03:01:23,861 --> 03:01:28,060
than the costage you can trade with oil. Go. If you need to continue,

3220
03:01:29,021 --> 03:01:34,550
I think there's a cost time to deal with this, uh, uhm. We'll do.

3221
03:01:34,551 --> 03:01:36,635
All right. Yeah. All right. We'll do that. Oh,

3222
03:01:36,636 --> 03:01:37,640
we're done. you

3223
03:02:56,971 --> 03:03:01,971
So

3224
03:03:02,694 --> 03:03:05,173
now, wait for me to check and see what the projects can seriously- You

3225
03:03:05,174 --> 03:03:09,762
can use on a great position

3226
03:03:09,763 --> 03:03:13,939
later. I've wondered- I don't know if this- This is one of those movies

3227
03:03:13,940 --> 03:03:16,422
where you get- get supplements and say, hey, yeah,

3228
03:03:16,423 --> 03:03:17,876
some are you. How about that?

3229
03:03:21,931 --> 03:03:26,956
I'm going to go around to my position.

3230
03:03:27,003 --> 03:03:30,232
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

3231
03:04:11,011 --> 03:04:15,574
You guys have a commodity

3232
03:04:15,575 --> 03:04:18,123
pricing matrix that you updated online.

3233
03:04:18,314 --> 03:04:22,565
Bye bye. Still related,

3234
03:04:23,075 --> 03:04:25,107
you know. Uhh,

3235
03:04:25,118 --> 03:04:27,637
I'm just a lot of personal history, basically. Please. Yeah,

3236
03:04:27,638 --> 03:04:30,460
so what we did is, in the comments,

3237
03:04:30,614 --> 03:04:32,823
I just had, and everything.

3238
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:37,475
I'm not a procurement guy, I just send it out,

3239
03:04:37,476 --> 03:04:40,076
and this isn't a price for that, and for our custom-making purposes,

3240
03:04:40,281 --> 03:04:42,368
we never can laugh until it's for a p********** knowledge, so.

3241
03:04:42,382 --> 03:04:45,567
Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, it means by,

3242
03:04:45,661 --> 03:04:48,358
you know, a 36, a past 16,

3243
03:04:48,359 --> 03:04:51,304
17, we have more than one six. Thanks. Y'all,

3244
03:04:51,305 --> 03:04:55,212
the time you go out is if you're quoting a truck loan or something

3245
03:04:55,213 --> 03:04:58,347
really big and you can get it for one plate here and one plate

3246
03:04:58,348 --> 03:05:01,624
there. Now, for those,

3247
03:05:01,625 --> 03:05:05,907
uhm, for those most of the time you'll reach out to the leading truck

3248
03:05:05,908 --> 03:05:08,996
person, Mr. Ryu. You It's been purchased for a while,

3249
03:05:08,997 --> 03:05:13,509
because of the two. It's always had a perceived increase of the owners

3250
03:05:13,510 --> 03:05:15,618
of that environment. Have you seen this? I mean,

3251
03:05:15,619 --> 03:05:18,178
it's nice that you can dump that off on quote unquote,

3252
03:05:18,179 --> 03:05:22,693
the concurrency that they just are responsible for keeping

3253
03:05:22,694 --> 03:05:25,107
that up. Yeah, we should work.

3254
03:05:25,108 --> 03:05:29,635
It's always something we can put together. I like some of our vendors,

3255
03:05:29,636 --> 03:05:32,881
so you don't have to apologize today. You can go on to the website,

3256
03:05:32,882 --> 03:05:37,898
or you can just re-sign back up with pro developers and re-establishing

3257
03:05:37,899 --> 03:05:40,163
online. Yep. Okay, we'll see next Is they all, uh,

3258
03:05:40,173 --> 03:05:42,310
associated with my whole team and all that,

3259
03:05:42,311 --> 03:05:44,877
but you're right. I had all the next sense of all of them.

3260
03:05:44,878 --> 03:05:47,131
Yeah, so I'm working for me established online.

3261
03:05:47,132 --> 03:05:49,551
That's,

3262
03:05:49,552 --> 03:05:52,206
uh, depending on it,

3263
03:05:52,463 --> 03:05:54,494
I mean, there's always one bit, and I'll be scared.

3264
03:05:54,495 --> 03:05:57,861
Thank you. Close. Especially when you're doing better stuff.

3265
03:05:58,265 --> 03:06:01,516
Yeah, and I'm usually, because I'm an estimate,

3266
03:06:01,526 --> 03:06:04,398
I would run weekly. you I would take a look to see what the

3267
03:06:04,399 --> 03:06:06,643
price of things was doing.

3268
03:06:06,644 --> 03:06:08,974
Ah, I'd say, hey, uh, next month is, Service Chairs Are Changing. Well, that's

3269
03:06:08,975 --> 03:06:12,086
probably the scene. I don't I don't But I don't It's all published,

3270
03:06:12,087 --> 03:06:15,133
Jira. Yeah. Yeah,

3271
03:06:15,134 --> 03:06:19,171
it's all accessible, something that will be deep.

3272
03:06:19,172 --> 03:06:23,212
But, you know, uuh,

3273
03:06:23,223 --> 03:06:25,499
I'm going to wait until the shipment plays.

3274
03:06:25,926 --> 03:06:28,629
What's your part? Anytime soon,

3275
03:06:28,630 --> 03:06:31,244

3285
03:07:09,832 --> 03:07:12,417
so if you touch him, then we put him in the contacts.

3286
03:07:13,175 --> 03:07:15,931
And only, you don't have his phone in the picture. It's in there.

3287
03:07:15,932 --> 03:07:20,724

3292
03:07:35,738 --> 03:07:38,270
once here, the work related one,

3293
03:07:38,271 --> 03:07:41,878
hang on. Alright. Alright. That's a bit of a,

3294
03:07:41,879 --> 03:07:44,063
a bit of a list, a paper and a flat paper,

3295
03:07:44,064 --> 03:07:47,517
a bit of a 12-gang of things, I basically put it on a little

3296
03:07:47,518 --> 03:07:51,767
bit later. I'm falling. I was prepared now because they came and bought me

3297
03:07:51,871 --> 03:07:55,232
on my computer one morning, but about a public.

3298
03:07:55,454 --> 03:07:58,151
Well, good. I the floor of it,

3299
03:07:58,152 --> 03:08:01,477
kind of backed up by contacts and my other contacts.

3300
03:08:01,580 --> 03:08:04,171
I set it to my, to see if there's a file.

3301
03:08:04,172 --> 03:08:08,702
I'll see you later on to myself. There were some other

3302
03:08:08,703 --> 03:08:12,211
things that I wanted. I just,

3303
03:08:12,212 --> 03:08:14,407
The keys instead. Here,

3304
03:08:14,408 --> 03:08:17,004
now. I've been to places that have done that and made the places in

3305
03:08:17,005 --> 03:08:20,251
it. Yeah, later. How late do you like it?

3306
03:08:20,252 --> 03:08:23,658
Everything. One place you need to find out if you can make it with

3307
03:08:23,659 --> 03:08:26,745
a bus. No, that's right. And normally when you get a notice,

3308
03:08:26,746 --> 03:08:30,001
you're not that good. Sure. I was a construction manager,

3309
03:08:30,004 --> 03:08:32,912
so they actually kept me from, like, doing that in three weeks.

3310
03:08:33,416 --> 03:08:36,929
But the day it came, it's okay. Okay. Stand up,

3311
03:08:37,737 --> 03:08:40,533
walk with your keyboard, don't touch anything,

3312
03:08:40,563 --> 03:08:42,595
and here's the box. You know,

3313
03:08:42,596 --> 03:08:44,664
I'm gonna turn it and notice the depth. That's it. Yeah. All right. Okay,

3314
03:08:44,665 --> 03:08:46,924
but, that's why I'm so big.

3315
03:08:46,925 --> 03:08:52,101
Yeah. So, I'm gonna turn

3316
03:08:52,102 --> 03:08:54,674
it again. You need your badge? Yep. Yep.

3317
03:08:56,129 --> 03:08:59,870
I have to make this off at home from order.

3318
03:08:59,871 --> 03:09:07,494
you ha ha ha The 903

3319
03:09:07,495 --> 03:09:11,119
low 4-2. 4-2.

3320
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:15,139
Check. Ultimately,

3321
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:18,002
it's- A little bit of a,

3322
03:09:18,003 --> 03:09:21,073
surviving, in touch. It'd be slow than a hundred there,

3323
03:09:21,074 --> 03:09:24,571
wouldn't be any use. Ok. Bye. Good.

3324
03:09:23,051 --> 03:09:27,567
Good. Kind of long as it was,

3325
03:09:27,568 --> 03:09:30,780
I think it was sweet, it's more unusual behind that side.

3326
03:09:31,125 --> 03:09:33,787
What we need, anymore, need that word. And right there,

3327
03:09:34,356 --> 03:09:36,689
well that line where it won't, there's going to be sweet,

3328
03:09:36,690 --> 03:09:38,959
there's going to be sweet, there's Oh,

3329
03:09:39,154 --> 03:09:43,073
yeah. You cannot believe it. Anyone agrees with their tips on it?

3330
03:09:43,176 --> 03:09:48,083
Yeah. That's just all that's great about the developing

3331
03:09:48,084 --> 03:09:54,514
program. You I don't know where it's going. I don't know where going

3332
03:09:54,515 --> 03:09:57,985
to uhh.

3333
03:10:05,191 --> 03:10:10,191
Well,

3334
03:10:11,877 --> 03:10:14,191
we should not get it.

3335
03:10:14,192 --> 03:10:16,830
He's divided in units.

3336
03:10:17,773 --> 03:10:20,850
Do you know how I'm going to play a role very much? I'm just

3337
03:10:20,851 --> 03:10:25,111
going to go up there. We're going to do I don't know.

3338
03:10:25,112 --> 03:10:27,740
Like what? I need to do it. Alright, some one does not work.

3339
03:10:27,778 --> 03:10:30,151
Ehm. That's the deal.

3340
03:10:30,152 --> 03:10:37,444
That's good stuff. There's a heat check there. What do you think

3341
03:10:37,445 --> 03:10:39,639
about that as well? You Yeah, I see,

3342
03:10:39,640 --> 03:10:44,210
so, we got some really good

3343
03:10:44,796 --> 03:10:47,905
welded. Good. So,

3344
03:10:47,906 --> 03:10:51,140
Netflix and guys can understand. We'll take it down,

3345
03:10:51,141 --> 03:10:53,294
uhm,

3346
03:10:53,304 --> 03:10:57,065
even like, remote. Oh uhm, in case one of the days I was there.

3347
03:10:58,814 --> 03:11:02,015
Cause I had a structural experience and I had a lot of video experience.

3348
03:11:02,016 --> 03:11:04,441
Just come back. So, he's a very good,

3349
03:11:04,442 --> 03:11:06,879
uh, he's very good at doing this.

3350
03:11:07,589 --> 03:11:10,172
So, and the advice is here, so I'll be good at losing.

3351
03:11:10,173 --> 03:11:12,969
The one where he is in his performance. So.

3352
03:11:14,812 --> 03:11:17,241
I don't know why, but I was like, wow, I can't because of the

3353
03:11:17,242 --> 03:11:20,335
actual himself. So, I mean, it's, it's still bad.

3354
03:11:21,691 --> 03:11:25,205
It's still bad. And it's, it's almost back on.

3355
03:11:25,206 --> 03:11:27,588
Bye And I have a lot of that still bad.

3356
03:11:27,598 --> 03:11:30,286
That's very important to me.

3357
03:11:30,839 --> 03:11:34,231
So, you all, well, okay. You don't have any money for it.

3358
03:11:34,232 --> 03:11:36,756
I don't know if you've paid it just well for living in the book.

3359
03:11:36,757 --> 03:11:39,006
Uh, you lost all my best, but, yeah,

3360
03:11:39,257 --> 03:11:41,353
stop that. It's a huge win. All right,

3361
03:11:41,354 --> 03:11:45,212
good. I-I don't miss a layoff,

3362
03:11:45,213 --> 03:11:47,558
but it's just-they're eating all the water,

3363
03:11:47,559 --> 03:11:49,696
leaving them in the chat.

3364
03:11:49,697 --> 03:11:53,676
So, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, and they have a background.

3365
03:11:53,677 --> 03:11:54,406
Alright.

3366
03:11:59,191 --> 03:12:01,502

3367
03:12:01,582 --> 03:12:03,920

3369
03:12:09,241 --> 03:12:11,426

3370
03:12:12,392 --> 03:12:15,091
Yeah. So we ended up.

3371
03:12:15,092 --> 03:12:17,530
So, I don't want you to deliver it,

3372
03:12:17,531 --> 03:12:21,241
because they're in a dog. We're going to go sit down and see if

3373
03:12:21,242 --> 03:12:23,477
we're going to have time for that. So we're going to go ahead.

3374
03:12:23,478 --> 03:12:27,911
Bye. And I'm going to be attached on a bit of a shoot here.

3375
03:12:28,235 --> 03:12:31,898
It's not going to be right. And I'm going to sit down and see

3376
03:12:31,899 --> 03:12:33,979
if I can. I can get, you get it to get me.

3377
03:12:34,934 --> 03:12:37,903
That was said, I'm going to do a little bit of a burnout.
