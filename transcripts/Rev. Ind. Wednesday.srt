1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:05,637
Yeah. Yeah,

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:13,466
<v Ricky Horton>it's definitely,

3
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:17,136
uh.

4
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:21,597
Considering the speed I'm moving.

5
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:26,332
I'm sorry. Today's show is smoother.

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,274
Okay, looking good. We've got the new database for the Oracle,

7
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,822
so we can get that set up. And,

8
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:36,283
uh,

9
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,226
I'd like to thank all the people who come here.

10
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,539
So, I think that's going to be within the end.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,229
So, that'll get us. Also, I just had to take that,

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,111
you know, and then, I'm going to take it and go with it.

13
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:52,230
Okay. So,

14
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:56,189
I guess it's once we get at least the baseline on what they're expecting

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,558
established. I'll let more from home once you're placed next week and sit in

16
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,580
my own office and pull out the air for a few years.

17
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,774
Yeah. Yeah,

18
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:12,943
I don't want to act so hard. It'll be interesting.

19
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:16,185
Yeah. Depends on what their expectations are.

20
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,058
Hopefully they're reasonable expectations.

21
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:22,111
Not ones that are outside of the, Yeah. Yeah,

22
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:27,474
but I imagine it's probably something similar

23
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,151
to what I've been doing in requisitions for a long time.

24
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,289
For nesting wire,

25
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,165
I'm going to have us add wire sizes and gauges in there,

26
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:40,703
and, uh, I'm going to just keep those in the same linear metric as,

27
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,166
as the round bar, that's, that's what we'll end up with.

28
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,211
Five minute strut,

29
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,786
that's where we'll get. Yeah. Interesting.

30
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:54,156
You'll have to put it in, the wire is.

31
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:58,709
What? Like, how many feet that you actually buy in a school or

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,191
whatever it is. Yeah.

33
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:07,613
Stephen, Stephen and Michael can buy all the way up to 3,000 foot schools.

34
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,472
But. Yeah,

35
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:13,979
we'll see what. See what it comes to when we get to that and

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,109
then, uh, yeah, Alan's gonna kick up shot average this morning,

37
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,269
so he's just gonna listen. Until we get back in here and

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,156
then we set it for our agenda today.

39
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:29,191
Disintegration, contracting,

40
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,700
leasing, and then electrical. Uh,

41
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:35,131
and then I think.

42
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:38,172
That's,

43
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,840
there's some light topics that need to be burned through really quick,

44
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,359
so, uhm,

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,964
we can take a look at. Production and look at our odds,

46
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,944
see if there's any adjustment they should make, uh,

47
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:52,171
make sure that they have the rest of the route set.

48
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,271
Uh, recordings and then,

49
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,521
uh,

50
00:02:56,532 --> 00:03:00,216
I think we can still drop road back to the road.

51
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:02,700
I don't,

52
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:06,108
I don't feel, I don't need to tell you what you think.

53
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,191
I don't feel good at all about the estimations.

54
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:12,644
That's their labor. And maybe the total labor's coming out.

55
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:16,171
I don't know. But, uhm, it seems like that's what is being used.

56
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,679
But the rate limit is vastly different.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,356
So, I don't know if that's a good I

58
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,734
mean, that's something we, we could always go back to,

59
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:30,845
or like, okay, yep, yeah, we need something else to do.

60
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:34,842
That's, uh. There is focus.

61
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,529
I may report, uh, honestly,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,962
I do know that they're going to keep pushing. For us to have a

63
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:47,033
higher percentage, even though everything's been adjusted for 75% and we've never really

64
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,781
tweaked that. You only need to change the settings,

65
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,018
but on the default, when I submit a start rebellion,

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,196
it starts at 98%, and then the estimator can adjust down or up.

67
00:03:56,197 --> 00:04:00,085
Yeah, and, uh, kind of tweak their numbers so that they're,

68
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:06,080
that we can, we can ask what people feel,

69
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:10,869
but. Are we going in the schedule at all?

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,176
Uh.

71
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:16,674
Mark didn't want us to touch screen. I'll tell you being here is the

72
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,590
last thing about it. Yeah. So, um,

73
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,533
tomorrow is a new year for. I feel like,

74
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,855
I feel like,

75
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,940
like I'm comfortable with the basketball.

76
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,088
Okay. So, yeah, you know,

77
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,792
I'm on my side,

78
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,292
but we're hearing and doing future production planning,

79
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:39,084
and I'm just- You know what, I'm out there and then you try to

80
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:41,280
forecast some things. So,

81
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:45,211
that was, and I am really tough to do with teacher forecasting.

82
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:48,047
Yeah, so, that'll be definitely a little bit of,

83
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,350
uhm,

84
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,251
just brief our shirt from me just reading with it.

85
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,992
. Yeah,

86
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:01,231
but you're using the projects, you know. Yeah. Are you telling me?

87
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:03,336
That needs to be in the production plate.

88
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,617
Yeah, the production planer, and then you get that on the plate.

89
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,789
So, I need to work back to- We haven't done that.

90
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,047
We haven't really full-scale,

91
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,802
Like, using the production planer?

92
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,970
Yeah, actually. Uh,

93
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,236
so, okay. Steps to using.

94
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,675
The production planer is the most efficient way,

95
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,893
uh, so that we can, uh,

96
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,951
between me and Alan, uhm,

97
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:37,479
if you- you should at

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,173
least be how to release work

99
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,460
on the power. I know we won't keep our own,

100
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,955
like, some projects can go on the side, and to forecast everything.

101
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:59,892
Thank watching. So

102
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,406
if we can get it there and we can justify that, it's just a

103
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,251
special. Yep. Yep. Yeah.

104
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,799
So, uh,

105
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,697
just to kind of make sure you're not in the spirit business.

106
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,291
Alright. Thank you.

107
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,599
You said it by me, you didn't read it today. Uuh.

108
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,516
Hold on. Hold on. No. No. No. No.

109
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,858
No. No. No. No.

110
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,976
No. Well, thank you.

111
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:33,316
I'm gonna lay it. Ha ha ha ha.

112
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,427
Sommeh ha ha ha. you do things, you know..lord I'm gonna switch in a

113
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:40,719
new t-shirt. Ha ha ha. And that's it. Cause like,

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,425
the storyline, you know, about 2050,

115
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,842
Phoenix, the beginning of the world. Good. Woah,

116
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:49,236
because it'd be so hot. Right.

117
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,617
I don't want that temperature. It's the loudest.

118
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:56,196
I remember 1.3. I remember when I was sitting out

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,766
and once said I'd become a years adult hack.

120
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:02,131
And that's right, I mean, I'm down here.

121
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,194
So I'm a high-summer for the record,

122
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:07,910
and I was mean. I remember one of the very ones that I don't

123
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:12,714
have a phoenix. Yes. I've been here for eight years

124
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,668
soon. You know what I'm gonna show you.

125
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,211
I'm I'm gonna show you. It's a shower.

126
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,551
I'm gonna film. Just,

127
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:23,819
just say it on me. Yeah. Yeah,

128
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,256
it's already hard, especially with, uh, uh. Bye.

129
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,948
All right, heads and stuff.

130
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,026
Yes, I will. I think my crew is here.

131
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,752
And, uh, what do the guys paint?

132
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:38,118
I mean, The paint just blushes me.

133
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,850
Yeah, it depends. I keep it in ice pockets.

134
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,975
Hm. . . And on the, uh,

135
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:48,494
try and eat and share, there is an internal area quite a bit and

136
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:52,427
then once it's dry out too. Good. Good. And then it will take a

137
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:57,099
little while to double him when trying to start slowing down so that they

138
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,131
can, they can. . I don't how to I don't know I don't know

139
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:08,941
how to I

140
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:09,311
don't know

141
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,054
My goal was to live in Durango in the summers.

142
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,630
Yeah. Hmm. You

143
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:34,468
I don't even see all the benefits.

144
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,258
So things to be on the level of other than my house paid off.

145
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:42,304
Ha ha ha, great! units. I'm gonna do

146
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,866
something eventually about water.

147
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:48,895
Yeah ha! Uh-oh. Okay. Oh, that port is already making me regret ever having

148
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,515
a new water. That's the,

149
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,300
uh. Bye.

150
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,560
The charging was the water treatment and the electrical water.

151
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:08,130
Good. So,

152
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,153
that's the joy of living out in states. and you next week's video. Thanks

153
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:14,316
for next week. Thanks for watching. We'll be right on the end of the

154
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,438
two. Breathe it. Four,

155
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,592
ten, nine, five, okay.

156
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,634
you So, well,

157
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,735
let's take a look at it. And,

158
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,979
uh, I don't know what that really is.

159
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,127
This one, and now it took me about 40 minutes. It's been awesome to

160
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,732
anybody that crickets on the road. But,

161
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,725
uh, it's about 50 minutes and we want it to be an hour to

162
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:37,253
a minute. We're going 10 minutes at night. Up.

163
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:40,211
We're going to have six-card message in about an hour and five minutes.

164
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,367
Come on. Go up there. Yeah,

165
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:46,677
I looked at it, so the department's out there.

166
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,240
It's definitely cheaper.

167
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:52,053
Thank you for having me. Yeah,

168
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:55,534
I just wanted to build up there and, uhm,

169
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:58,930
the miller was buying down rates, so I guess you're 0.7%.

170
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,389
I also, uh,

171
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,699
couldn't pass that on. you

172
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,402
. . Uhh, uhh, hmmm, hmmm,

173
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:21,193
hmmm, hmmm,

174
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:27,435
hmmm. We'll see in the next video.

175
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:31,347
Bye bye.

176
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:36,347
Hahaha.

177
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,090
That's what. Yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,381
Keeps at that. You know this one and, uh, ehm,

179
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:51,558
ehm. You I still want to match things.

180
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:54,633
Yes, uh.

181
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:57,682
But I've had any issues that- I mean, I've been on a spectrum,

182
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:01,317
uhm, with the audience, and special news,

183
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:05,197
and production tests. Here's-

184
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:18,026
Yeah, and it's a bad little shit looking for it.

185
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,391
Thanks for all those who either get the money.

186
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,703
All right. Well, well,

187
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:27,197
what's the weird amount of that means? Yeah, that'd be a shocker to the

188
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,253
weak, right? So, yeah, it was so weird.

189
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,544
the this argument in one place is you're already a spirit,

190
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:34,237
but vice-versa, you're running toward the best of your work.

191
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,946
But at least she's. And then we'll go to the next.

192
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:44,606
Yes. What I want

193
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,297
to happen to miss you now.

194
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,321
But that's like, eventually,

195
00:11:57,322 --> 00:12:01,881
yeah. Sounds like they're going to be doing whole-minute service steps.

196
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:03,977
And the big . . Getting the company to . .

197
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:06,014
. completely redo our servers.

198
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,802
So, uh, and that . . . this key is our original ITA.

199
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:13,869
Bye. He built everything that's done on and on here.

200
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,401
And that whole strip of service that himself.

201
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,648
And, uh, and And, you know,

202
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,789
he's like, alright, y'all okay,

203
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,406
we can do this. Yeah. We're long grown out and we have so many

204
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,597
different companies here. We're trying to tie together.

205
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,870
Yeah. You need to pay somebody who knows how to tie this together.

206
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:35,506
Yeah. Yeah, so. Is it going to be- Yeah,

207
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:40,025
a lot of the sugar room on premise.

208
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:44,774
It'll be the- same area in the main office where

209
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,613
the current one is. Yeah, it'll just be a whole lot more beefy.

210
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:53,366
Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

211
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:58,411
you very much.

212
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,652
It's, it's all slow when you first get in that round.

213
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:16,606
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

214
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:22,411
So, um, this thing integration discussion actually is here.

215
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:28,038
Well, we talked about this for a couple

216
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,410
of times. . . Yeah,

217
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,213
that's the main thing.

218
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,919
Thank you.

219
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,980
Yeah, okay.

220
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:52,474
So, that's, I guess,

221
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:55,708
please look at this. All right, I'm going to let her in,

222
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,400
you know, ehm, oops. this.

223
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:14,883
And that's it. Mm hmm.

224
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:17,983
They're on the whole business stop with it. Mm hmm.

225
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:20,091
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They'll have,

226
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,369
they'll have paper software for the county, obviously,

227
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,494
because this isn't a county software,

228
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,718
but they'll feed it, but. . . Yeah,

229
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,194
but, this is maybe, uhm, maybe it's all point for you.

230
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:32,520
Thank you.

231
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:47,976
Further in the last

232
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:50,823
time, uh, I'm trying to question the point.

233
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,838
Thanks. They wouldn't,

234
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,900
you know, get loose and you'll try it. So,

235
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:58,043
I'm going to be moving on. Alright.

236
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,451
Uh.

237
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:02,453
I'll see how that I guess the main thing would be,

238
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:05,100
which I can take notes here.

239
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,254
Umm,

240
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,491
this is an integral.

241
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,013
And I know I'm talking about the last 7 million and they're quite vivid

242
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:20,761
in the, uhm. No, no, regard some of your mission

243
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:24,636
problem. So I'm going to look at what they want.

244
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,089
So we have six in one,

245
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:32,671
all of our labor codes, to be-

246
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,739
I brought an estimate, pushed into production,

247
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:40,492
and then have our labor exported in the time-trapping way

248
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:44,381
that we- do in those time-trapping before it's with the labor codes associated,

249
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:47,548
pushed back into this. So,

250
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:52,355
we have to- uh, basically not doing that out in the early months,

251
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:56,791
uh. Well, we do all of our time-trapping in.

252
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:00,667
. . Everything that we export to Vista,

253
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:04,831
we export it in an Excel sheet.

254
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,219
That has each employees,

255
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:12,050
information, employee number, and then whenever we set up a project,

256
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:16,880
uh. Each sequence and a lot is actually your

257
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,844
phase code, so, uhm,

258
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,116
third. 39,000,

259
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:27,415
uhm, so, okay. We end up filtering our tabs down and cascading

260
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,049
it out, and- read mapping the,

261
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,863
uh, the sheets so that it can be put into a

262
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:39,800
system with this. Okay. You And this applies to 39,000

263
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,499
in the employee number and the hours associated.

264
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,218
And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it.

265
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,160
So I'm actually- And then there you have it through that other good project.

266
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:50,831
Or so it's automatically set up. uhm,

267
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,071
we do that for every project. And.

268
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,538
I need to be over with the supports.

269
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,204
And it happens a little bit. And.

270
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,009
I'm just the exhaustion in the snow.

271
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,958
No. That took him. So,

272
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,020
there's the look at the best case scenario.

273
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,814
It's going to be fine. Bye. Uhh,

274
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,463
yeah. Essentially, like, all of our people,

275
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,118
we have that one week bus person.

276
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,673
So. Don't. It really is,

277
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,688
um,

278
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,642
slightly begun. So, we have two different,

279
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:27,619
two different kinds of things. Thank you. And we have the face recognition system

280
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,210
that's completely extra on its team, all of it,

281
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,271
each employee, foxy, interfacial.

282
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,746
So they have a sample when they come in,

283
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:38,522
and then when they're working on projects and youth,

284
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,900
they're also implicating those hours. That's it.

285
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:41,802
All right. All right. All right. And going to The this meeting So that,

286
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,051
umm, this one, hm,

287
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:46,568
hm, hm, hm,

288
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,356
hm, hm, hm. Bye-bye.

289
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:53,055
You can see, that's where I was coming here.

290
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,403
Yeah. I was coming back against the project.

291
00:17:56,928 --> 00:18:00,944
And, you know, percent complete versus average use.

292
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:05,436
That's where we're going along. And this is what we reviewed in our Thursday.

293
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:10,074
So we'll see if we have a

294
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:16,424
moment. And Umm,

295
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:19,677
and we're not dealing with production stations or,

296
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:24,187
uhh, uhh. You trying to help our production stations and all of the,

297
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,288
umm,

298
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:30,430
contracting. I think it's not going to count in one more Is there a

299
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,048
daily labor report? Umm.

300
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:38,454
You Yes,

301
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:41,664
you know, uhm.

302
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,458
I don't know if there's a specific report that you can pull across all

303
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,161
projects because- it's project management side,

304
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,715
project management side, as a PAM report said,

305
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:52,866
hold across every single project management job.

306
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,960
Bye. Umm, but,

307
00:18:55,388 --> 00:19:01,337
each day, I get an email from the chat meeting that

308
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,497
is- I don't know,

309
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:08,200
basically a recap from previous day of hours used,

310
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:13,289
what increased- umm, if we're at a negative trend,

311
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,923
with hours, this percent competes,

312
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,760
and so on and so forth. . .

313
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,918
So I get this report daily being marked, give it so that we can

314
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,488
start getting ahead of it, This is our weekly sheet

315
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,380
that we reviewed and go around Fridays,

316
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:37,405
which is essentially this. The production schedules that are in

317
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:40,045
each project sequence associated,

318
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,460
um, just to review. Thank you. Plus,

319
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,838
can you use whatever you need, whatever,

320
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,997
or send it to Sarah? You know,

321
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:49,684
I'm not even gonna get that from your evaluating projects,

322
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,015
but. Good. Over the county side, you know, always,

323
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:55,778
I acknowledge you being able to look at daily,

324
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,103
later period. We'll see the next period,

325
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,603
forget which job that's happening. Yeah,

326
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:03,567
I mean, I can go in at the time and drive the module 30

327
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,652
for better. I'm turning on our owners and we can pull.

328
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,773
Oh. Well, I haven't watched the interview today,

329
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,620
I guess. So, you know, I believe is,

330
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:14,071
I don't know what you're talking about. Do you try productive labor person?

331
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:17,984
Is that productive labor? Uhh,

332
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,660
I mean, direct versus indirect,

333
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:23,438
I guess it's a better way to say it like. Bye bye. Yeah, so

334
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:27,767
we knew that, uhm, indirect project for the year where guys can apply their

335
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,156
time to their mom and indirect. it. Uh.

336
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:32,635
Which would be our 1200. Uh,

337
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,963
this is all anything entered towards this project.

338
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:38,201
It goes, indirect, fast. thumbs.

339
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,478
Umm, but most of the time,

340
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:44,327
the situation is so aggressive, you're using this,

341
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,710
so. I don't Most of the time,

342
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,205
all of the time, you just have to get into the projects.

343
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:56,979
So. But. and go

344
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,096
time tracking summary.

345
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,257
I I can't even,

346
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:15,010
And

347
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:18,391
this will give me a summary of,

348
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:22,059
All the labor that I was entered yesterday.

349
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,097
So, there's a couple of guys.

350
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,854
I think this one needs to be adjusted. There's no way in hell.

351
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:34,440
I'm gonna eat yesterday in 37.2-5-9.

352
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,955
I don't know, I'm trying to hit the Monday,

353
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:39,536
uhm, so this would be where,

354
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,967
uhm, or T.J.

355
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,992
goes in. . Those are, excuse me, what I'm playing with this,

356
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,148
and then why in the world is this this playing,

357
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,551
we're not gonna get it. So, yeah.

358
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,263
But,

359
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:56,326
yeah, this is, this is probably the best,

360
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:58,596
best area for this. Yes.

361
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,479
So, and then, hey,

362
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,122
what you're talking is, each line item is a person,

363
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:06,451
or it's really the summation of.

364
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:09,047
Have a good one. Multiple people in that, uhh,

365
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:12,211
this is our entire shots. It's usually yesterday,

366
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,731
right? So, uhh.

367
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:19,469
. So yesterday, somebody, some group of people wanted,

368
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:27,338
you know, charge 37 hours, too. . Yes,

369
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,799
and we ended up going in the area, and they walked into the shipping

370
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,345
and seating department. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Now,

371
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,352
this is not the unit you should be receiving.

372
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,834
So why are they wanting to the handling?

373
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:41,499
Bye bye. Because shooting or receiving does

374
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,231
not handle our material force. They often trust.

375
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:46,831
That's it. So that's it. All right. Yeah. Mhm.

376
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,008
If it requires to be removed from the shot or pulled out in the

377
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:54,039
shot or space, you know, the front because it's completed or needs to go

378
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,154
from the finish station. In the wild station,

379
00:22:56,456 --> 00:23:00,248
all of that is handled by a shot with release,

380
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:02,916
yep. So, we essentially- I'm sure.

381
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:08,075
Usually, from majority of our projects have,

382
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:10,908
well, annually. I'm going to,

383
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,816
So, uhm, those give percent complete mark-offs as they

384
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:27,255
go through the mark with the p-straching and- And,

385
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:30,152
uh, and to have some time to inspections.

386
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:32,629
Cause, uh, it's time to,

387
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,071
uh, cut loose, um, burry.

388
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:37,247
And, to, uh, cut loose as well.

389
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,806
And, uh, well, it is a,

390
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,359
well inspection. So.

391
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:47,248
So That's totally

392
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:50,089
gone bigger. But.

393
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:53,787
Bye. No,

394
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:59,084
no, no, no, no, no. Well, that's most likely not a very well as

395
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,107
well. Okay, cool. you Yeah,

396
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,509
what do you like when you know why?

397
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,704
Umm,

398
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:08,547
I guess, at least. Please.

399
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:18,892
With the VISTA integration,

400
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:24,091
it is to not have us pulling XL sheets

401
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,082
from my- I'm finding them so that they can be affordable for it,

402
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,591
and then having that extra step beginning.

403
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:35,371
Um, but I'm pretty sure heard from them that this integration is,

404
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:39,692
is an invoice out from a purchase version down the point.

405
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:43,504
Alright, take all on the purchasing side there.

406
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,625
So, and that, I mean,

407
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:48,631
for purchase it's viewing here and,

408
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:53,402
That's pretty much the extent of it with the exception of a few sub-replication

409
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:55,540
videos about it together. And,

410
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:58,308
uh, Go. Go. So, so with that,

411
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:02,612
I don't really see, because I'm sure with the VISTA,

412
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,646
with purchasing that. Yeah. Yeah. Maudable.

413
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:10,617
There's money associated with that. And it's not been a little bit innocent.

414
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:13,676
You do double work. So, I'm gonna spend- I'm gonna even still leave the

415
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,912
double work. So, it's just a, uhm, not a nice, it's a nice eating,

416
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:20,340
like, good investment. Yeah. I enjoyed it.

417
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:23,542
And friends. Have a good eating,

418
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:26,717
so. Uh-huh. That's it. Uh-huh, so I don't see them ever.

419
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,824
I heard Umm,

420
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:34,034
holding the contracting air on my goodness.

421
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:36,701
And all the reason I say it is because.

422
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,843
. . . Umm.

423
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:41,022
So, me do not do the contracting air.

424
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:44,580
So, ehm, ehm. Thank you.

425
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:49,284
I'll the next third thought is probably my last one.

426
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:54,517
But I'll get time instead of spending more- So I've got more people from

427
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:58,395
there, say anything. I don't know if I'm to get any of that.

428
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:00,691
Yeah. So why don't people not try?

429
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:08,078
The interface is a little clunky,

430
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,158
uhm, for the, I love the more use of, uh,

431
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,614
a panel software, uh, their, their touch,

432
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:15,294
touch, I mean, no more to do that,

433
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,689
rather than any. So. So, So, yeah.

434
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:22,528
Which definitely makes sense. Without definitely moving that statement,

435
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:24,691
we're going to our time.

436
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:27,383
I'm sure I can do the time tracking the input.

437
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,341
I think we're going here and it's easier

438
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:37,705
to see. . But, uhm, like, the notes section,

439
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:40,711
there's so many random notes here.

440
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:44,185
And we can't, I don't believe him. I just stay in there forever.

441
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,874
And, it is, it is.

442
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:53,040
One less. 7 8 9 9 9 9

443
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:57,685
9 10 minutes to put

444
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,879
an entry in. So, a lot of the guys will track it on a

445
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,771
sheet, give it to them all, and enter it in about 5 minutes here.

446
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:09,838
And it's done. So many people want

447
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,751
really good time tracking.

448
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,116
In here. Uhm,

449
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:17,385
and this is fun, so it's not there.

450
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,731
Uhm, and we definitely use it.

451
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:24,634
But, I'm actually considered,

452
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:28,046
like, like, my muscle has an actual exercise,

453
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:32,649
so sorry. Thank you. I'm actually considered paying you to do a better interface,

454
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,756
um, with some more controls and stuff around here.

455
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:39,310
So, if I were to get there,

456
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:41,171
I was pretty glad you said you were going to need to live in

457
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:43,670
it. Yeah. Uh, that would be,

458
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:46,562
that would be pretty house. So,

459
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:50,416
so what's the system of timing out your minute? Um,

460
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,595
currently, time is captured.

461
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:55,120
are going to a year tracking and production,

462
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:58,481
had sported out, and uh,

463
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,751
and then verified against our facial. We'll see in the one.

464
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:03,816
This is a recognition system.

465
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:08,210
And we have in the shop, we compare numbers to numbers to make sure

466
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:11,017
that they don't matter. You match. And then, uh,

467
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,160
and then we submit the actual Excel sheet from this,

468
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:16,540
uh, from TechLog2W.

469
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:21,438
. . So, our conditional recognition was installed when we used to have QuickBooks,

470
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:24,075
and I was using the same, uhm,

471
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,494
moving quickly. It was plugged in with their face,

472
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:29,337
and it clogged out with their face, and it would just send it.

473
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:34,390
But, uhm, that would give us the- Projecting and breaking them and what

474
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:38,479
they were working on. This could be the ability to know what product they're

475
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,825
working on if they don't have our own request.

476
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:44,490
If they a project that day, then the time you actually divide it up

477
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:47,303
between five persons. That's why you move both.

478
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,025
We need to implement the period with, Well, it's the work done during the

479
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:52,125
day, and they have the witness to trust us. Yeah.

480
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,618
Pretty much. Once they need it now,

481
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:57,047
anyone's a- I'm used to a planet that's about a ton of- I'll see

482
00:28:57,048 --> 00:29:01,957
you in the head after. Because the guy puts in his face

483
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,239
code for everyone to do it. Childx.

484
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,253
Thanks. Workstation, you know, workstation and why.

485
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:11,454
And he may work for five jobs a day, but it's all system.

486
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:16,144
See, it's probably the- That's good. I'm trying to correct me

487
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:20,916
if I'm wrong. Hold on.

488
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,414
Well, eventually that, that's the thing from,

489
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:28,267
yeah, right, make sure that people are actually working.

490
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,538
Yeah. you And the same thing we're actually working.

491
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:32,982
It does not look in the checks. And,

492
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,871
but even then it is the, uh. Yeah.

493
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:41,520
Making sure you're coming in after having the document with somebody's

494
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:44,111
over that, and it's the amazing, uhm,

495
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,886
kiss, and ye- Here is, you can go in here and say you started

496
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,621
at 4 o'clock in the morning and it,

497
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,951
you know, it was there to verify that. Thank you.

498
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:55,579
I have got your face of animal monitor and it takes a picture of

499
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,474
you and you get in, uhm,

500
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,250
then, then there's kelle more kelle. It be a good you're in,

501
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,795
you know, yeah, because again,

502
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:06,242
it's like, where they need people to say if you don't want to talk

503
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:09,031
to them. So, so. So.

504
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:12,923
And that's the other side of us using this and that,

505
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,507
um, in the morning they walk by,

506
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:18,782
catch us their base. They can go off to the floor,

507
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:22,376
stop waiting. And when they have their eye bags on their cell phones,

508
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,823
and they can be suddenly right there.

509
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,368
you Up to the umm, one minute of this next product you can plug

510
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,487
in on this one because I'm going to do this one.

511
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:33,156
So, I'll tell you what to do now.

512
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:37,992
I would rather try to automate the work to,

513
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:40,396
uh, to report any of the ads.

514
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:42,811
That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:45,456
And that's something that I also live in, if well,

516
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,791
uhm,

517
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:51,854
and setting it up for a, It's just an uneasy tweak.

518
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:54,765
Um, the problem I get into that would be,

519
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,271
I mean, the call from the shop manager, he has a,

520
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,862
I'm doing their time for writing it.

521
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:03,205
I need you to hold off and then I have a report explaining that

522
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,311
to five people and I'm like, hold on.

523
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:09,965
Yeah, I see it's to be addressed for if somebody decided

524
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:13,351
to put 36 in the mirror instead of three or six.

525
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:17,392
Yeah, so, and uh,

526
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:21,753
but I think that that ain't me. And I say- hmm,

527
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:26,638
hmmm, hmmm. the spray shinkler

528
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,436
to get in.

529
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:32,502
I mean, there'd be a way to get down on the right floor,

530
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:35,046
and that should be needed to just be, okay.

531
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:37,471
Custom export. I don't know.

532
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,223
All the millions. That would be,

533
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:44,535
that would be definitely the, the, side is not having to go in and

534
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,876
cut. I think,

535
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:49,354
uh, I think all of my shit comes out very,

536
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:53,011
not that hard to what we need. If you want to look into that,

537
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:56,625
I've got, I'm getting the names of some people that can do that.

538
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,258
Okay. As I was by Chris from the Parks Center in the rooms,

539
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:03,286
we're going to get Here, twice time does that take a minute?

540
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,291
Uhh, I'm doing the time.

541
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,391
Thank you. Alright. Bye for the minutes.

542
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:11,579
Good. Good. Per day? I don't want it.

543
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,650
One day a week. One day a week. Yeah, that's all good.

544
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:17,671
Yeah, so. That's, that's been the biggest.

545
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:21,195
We haven't had too many,

546
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:24,005
like, custom points in here, dispersal reports going to get,

547
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:27,029
uh. Thank you. You can get spending,

548
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:29,715
you know, so you got a lot of different things that you want, and

549
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:32,830
you always get changed, and adjusted and on,

550
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:36,406
so. So, You know, I'm on a dozen per reserve on your own vacation

551
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:39,925
to somebody else's. There's other people that can do it,

552
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:44,776
uhm, in shock. One of the shock minutes were long because the

553
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,920
time tracking emails that he sent, uh,

554
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,836
he didn't do the exports, uh, marketing and assistance.

555
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:53,371
I'm gonna a look at community experience as well.

556
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,296
Giving you a food, ech, a farm guy. Is somebody else does the pain

557
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:57,876
guys? Uh, a pain system uses system.

558
00:32:57,877 --> 00:33:03,347
What sort of thing are they been very anti-system

559
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:05,911
for a long time and now? Now,

560
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:09,153
We are pushing heavily for them to use it and,

561
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:13,546
well, being the leader of buildings at this point,

562
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:15,731
is- Very unward with it. So,

563
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:20,175
uhm, we're taking full advantage of having an advocate,

564
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:25,214
um, so. They say. Yeah,

565
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:27,739
and it's definitely,

566
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,872
you know. It's definitely came along the way. Me and, and, and.

567
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,074
Good. So,

568
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,191
uhm, okay.

569
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:38,071
So, thank you.

570
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:41,637
I guess if this is what I asked, how to do business integration,

571
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:46,121
what we can do as well. Integrate a few days ago.

572
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,340
Uhh, let me see if I need a language.

573
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:49,840
And

574
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:58,728
there's a bunch

575
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:06,888
of this. So,

576
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:11,081
this is Paul and Rose and she got it. See ya. It's going to

577
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:15,992
happen. So I am trying

578
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:19,167
to add a deep number,

579
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:23,403
obviously. See I'm going an e-document to it.

580
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,775
I got an e-order. Oh, it's a jintique.

581
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:25,680
And.

582
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:38,429
I don't know.

583
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,503
All characters are sad.

584
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:42,762
Uhm, I see that. You know what I hear?

585
00:34:42,763 --> 00:34:44,856
This is some of the needs to hear it.

586
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:47,227
If you can send that mobile email, or it's,

587
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:49,565
this is something about how the game occurs.

588
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,648
Like, you gotta get this, uh, lovely,

589
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:56,824
uhm, uhm, uhh, So

590
00:34:56,825 --> 00:35:01,079
you need to set that up locally. So we can see the preset maintenance.

591
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,193
Good. You can set that up right there and it just skids out there,

592
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,498
but rather than getting a big upset,

593
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:09,871
there's no- there's no- Are we sitting here? No, we're sitting We to wait.

594
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:17,942
The reason it should be an individual said. Um,

595
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:21,470
yeah. Yeah. As long as everybody has an older drive,

596
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:24,498
man, man. Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,730
Now, umm. Bye. Bring the gym everybody she has on our

598
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:33,606
butt mat that's in tight blood. It's just in front of me whether it's

599
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:38,148
good. I do have some reports because right now there's a place

600
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:40,505
where customer reports should be. Okay.

601
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,696
Umm, I like it.

602
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:45,420
And all of us are, we're made up by this last thing.

603
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:50,182
Umm, the reason I like that is because we want

604
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:54,553
to do it in. You more. He's got,

605
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:57,269
everybody knows exactly where to get a similar law,

606
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:00,226
so they'll, like, be able to. I've been a project manager for a lot

607
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,862
of things, something that happened on the job,

608
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:06,816
on the airport. What was it? Part of it was a review.

609
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:09,003
I think you should say, I think you should do whatever work.

610
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:11,349
They actually get a log input out.

611
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:14,445
With that, I'm getting your computer before I'm your log.

612
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:16,894
Oh. Oh. Well,

613
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:21,273
but yeah, you said that. Didn't add it to the bottom of the limits.

614
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:23,855
Everyone used to say it. All right. By the following,

615
00:36:23,856 --> 00:36:26,998
everybody's going to have a checkbox and they're going to fall a bit weird.

616
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:31,327
Okay. So, now I'm going to try and receive- Yeah,

617
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:35,877
I'm getting out of close to putting all of

618
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:38,911
that on the server area. Good.

619
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:42,183
Good. Yeah,

620
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:46,792
I'll get the key. Would anybody have sneered a

621
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:49,234
burp? We want you to modify the, uh,

622
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:51,942
uh, or customize the report that's out of you.

623
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,051
Thank you. Bye.

624
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:58,432
Does that be able to customize it?

625
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,038
That'll just be customized in the end report.

626
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,091
Thanks for watching.

627
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:06,263
Yeah, and if I don't, if that's how you get up there,

628
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:09,600
it'll look right. Probably not.

629
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,250
Probably just gonna be a- I mean, if anything,

630
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:14,638
I'll keep the request, and then I'll do it.

631
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,795
So, uh,

632
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,848
we try again some more. Alright, let's month, okay.

633
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:20,974
So, anyway, that

634
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,895
now not gonna be as mobile at this point.

635
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,553
Yeah, but, if you didn't,

636
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,021
just set that. Get a poll.

637
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:40,076
Oh. I'll show you a good set, man. Yeah. Let me get it.

638
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:43,291
Sorry. Perfect. Thank you, man.

639
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,505
That is it.

640
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:52,066
Yeah. Cool. That

641
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:55,068
big tech, what do you do? I've been looking for that for a long

642
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:57,387
long time. I've been eating a little bit, finally, last year,

643
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,578
I called the month, but I'm like, work out in the meeting. Like,

644
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:04,324
I'm sure if I reply to this, you know, cause they were doing a

645
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:07,341
good thing. And people are like, well look at the girl and look at

646
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:10,034
that. I have to see the droplets. Awkward,

647
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:12,086
so I'd say. Yeah, I've had it.

648
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:14,294
I've had it. Yeah,

649
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:16,956
I've had I was- I've never knew when you get started.

650
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:19,675
Yeah. They grew up instantly.

651
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:22,286
Somebody's not crazy. I've had it. I've had it. had it. had it.

652
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:24,867
I've I've had I've had it. Just check over here.

653
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:28,076
Send a screenshot of this. Make sure you get it next.

654
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,051
Still. Nah,

655
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:35,353
it's the- . . . Yeah, I think that's the- I'll make the adjustments

656
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,622
so that everything's uninserted, uhm,

657
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,074
is that a fee? Okay,

658
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:44,380
uhm, I think.

659
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,572
Again.

660
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:52,372
Back to whatever this will

661
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:57,927
be. Please. So, this is their new- the master of the urban-based

662
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:02,875
code guide. Which most of what I mean now

663
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:07,941
it is. lives. Oh, it's an infinite choice.

664
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:10,500
39.

665
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:11,736
Oh

666
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,737
So, this way,

667
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,839
it's kind of a construction building on us,

668
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:31,018
to use revenue. So, we're located 39,

669
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,758
it's actually the same building, 39, 1,000.

670
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:36,588
Okay. Yeah.

671
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,881
Which is, uh, typical, 39,

672
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:45,353
it's for company 40. Uh. So,

673
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,384
uh, company 40,

674
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,655
division 39, I and then the activity levels is what they break in.

675
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:55,488
next one. Okay, I'm So,

676
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,548
each, so 39 this pad, yeah, 39 is in it,

677
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:01,901
in the structure of the patch. You Ah, so.

678
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,134
And then, quite cool,

679
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:07,840
simple, okay, as everyone, as everyone.

680
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,146
Hey. So, so everybody is 40.

681
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:14,259
Then, you'll be on,

682
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,834
uh, face codes. And It's associated with each trade and area of

683
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:22,459
the work, or what. So this thing goes all the way through load.

684
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:25,398
Yeah. So if you- I'd rather look at company,

685
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:27,865
whatever. You would see very,

686
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:31,124
uh, same consistency for the shop and the building.

687
00:40:31,154 --> 00:40:33,359
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

688
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,500
anything the same thing. Uh, you could be honest,

689
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,497
not sure much of how blooming fields were.

690
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:42,156
No, I, I get it. I don't either. . Yeah,

691
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:44,777
this is the laundry.

692
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,091
The, uh, standard fees towards the building. One more supply.

693
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,685
As I would need, uh, a,

694
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:52,978
a, a, a specialism. So,

695
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,971
followed by with your other,

696
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,229
stops, and if you're reintegrating in,

697
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,255
um, or implementing this later,

698
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,951
dot unquote crap. The,

699
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:09,420
The best sh-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m.

700
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:12,324
the one who said,

701
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:15,191
Doc, you can grab that one if they want. You can grab that one

702
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:18,141
if you want. You that one Doc,

703
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,971
you've got it here.

704
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,962
No procedure. Here's what we're doing about it,

705
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:26,681
why is people don't make an option. Yeah,

706
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,011
otherwise, it's masking.

707
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:31,621
No, you have to have it. And, uh,

708
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:36,660
I think one of the things here is flow charts and descriptions

709
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,974
for everything. I mean, heck,

710
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,101
when you do an ERP upgrade, if you don't have it,

711
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,535
people think they know what it is, but they have no idea what it

712
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:47,854
would be. Yeah, yeah. I learned that one hard way last year.

713
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:51,008
Uh,

714
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:54,438
so if you're, if you're using- I don't if I'm starting on codes.

715
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,485
Uhm,

716
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:59,915
I don't see, uh,

717
00:41:59,925 --> 00:42:04,525
the issue. Thank you. But I was thinking that we were talking

718
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:06,615
about the carries from the,

719
00:42:06,616 --> 00:42:11,407
the beam. You might be one to the people on the house.

720
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:13,729
It seems how,

721
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,121
the one plan, the product, see what we're into.

722
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:20,652
Here. Thank you. And it might be a different one for

723
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:22,914
another type of sibling. Yeah.

724
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:26,041
But I don't see those. All guys. If you please have their spare.

725
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:29,792
I don't see that I'm getting sealed.

726
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,924
Umm, so this one's this one's most of the time I'm gonna check with

727
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:38,176
you. Our typical face cut off for labor and when

728
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:42,818
I get multiple sequences or multiple- histories of work to in the thirty-nine one

729
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:45,391
thousand, dot zero one, oh,

730
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:49,051
this is the- this joke labor? That's just- We'll see Peace.

731
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:53,200
We'll see you later, vote out later in the thousand. Material is zero,

732
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:55,795
eight, three thousand, and there has been, as usual,

733
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:58,054
the one that we initiated- I'm just kidding. You can skip with that.

734
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:03,054
Uh.

735
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:06,347
Bye So,

736
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:09,110
we usually take plain angles,

737
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:11,225
channels, beams, everything long, it's not up, it's huge. That one,

738
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,920
okay. So. I'm gonna go And see you Bye.

739
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:16,307
So, so you're telling me that,

740
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:19,708
ok, I have a piece of pipe.

741
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:25,004
Bye. I like I use in a structural project.

742
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:27,663
It would be that o 8 3 0.

743
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:30,036
But, if I use a piece of pipe on a rail.

744
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:32,101
It's so, it's still going to be a great video.

745
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:34,850
Yeah, it's uhh,

746
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,447
most of the time they don't end up getting into the material.

747
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,118
We're going to aim this. I'm breaking out of that thoroughly.

748
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:44,156
Yeah, they usually keep it or they need to have structural skill bucket.

749
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:48,592
The only time we will see that- That number to differ is if we

750
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:52,528
have multiple interior buckets for areas of work on the project.

751
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:57,314
Okay. So let me- We can make- so that we can have

752
00:43:57,572 --> 00:44:00,434
one of the best ones all after they gave you the- the base of

753
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:03,120
the extension. Here we go. And back we said,

754
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:05,730
ah, that's easy to do. What else?

755
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:09,997
I'm sure you think what else. You might not want you if you start.

756
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:20,365
That's more info. Now you could basically,

757
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:23,189
or have to say, every single line, I didn't want that face good,

758
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,568
I'll give you that material. Um. You But if all material should go on

759
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:30,753
the same thing as good, that's easy. If we can send it up to

760
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,497
the estimate, just the pH should be at the end of the estimate.

761
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:36,535
Here it is. Oh. Oh. Here's all the things we can associate across.

762
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:39,550
Uhm, so that would be simple to do.

763
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,096
On the back view, to the end. Okay.

764
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:48,743
You can put the, you get it on the PX as well.

765
00:44:48,744 --> 00:44:51,851
So it would, it would be a mirror. Come on. The bottom hat,

766
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:54,096
um, now,

767
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:58,111
you're playing for, if you're in.

768
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:04,780
Yeah, that's, that'll be worth it there, right? Yeah, and then, I mean, even

769
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:08,159
if we were. Bye bye. Even if we put it in the home material,

770
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,928
it's over eight, three thousand, and then we did have one is most

771
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:16,470
of the- time it's gonna be that, plus,

772
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:20,838
whatever connotations are gonna differentiate it from the area of work,

773
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:23,879
if the project's- that large, uhm,

774
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,855
outside of that, then it's- it's basically that would be our governing

775
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,036
code for the material. real. So,

776
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:33,354
a lot of times, uhm,

777
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,742
depending on the project engineer,

778
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:38,131
he and team I'm working with for the field.

779
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:44,129
Sometimes I get that same phase code as I have written on the

780
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,342
speakers for, PC forums,

781
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:49,821
product release forums, uhm,

782
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:52,557
how we do the technical side of things,

783
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:55,632
how we expect projects to come in. And, and everything.

784
00:45:55,633 --> 00:46:01,235
And so, aw man. Let's go.

785
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:05,094
Where's that at? you I shouldn't worry, you've written all those procedures.

786
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,661
Where's Gotta? Umm,

787
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:12,244
I have to see where it's located in the- the hour time at

788
00:46:12,245 --> 00:46:15,101
this point where you can change your eyes.

789
00:46:15,912 --> 00:46:20,570
But, uhm, I have to We certainly

790
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,868
link next week or something, but I appreciate it.

791
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,930
Yeah, yeah. I'm going to read that. Yeah,

792
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:30,684
uh, procedures. on us for any procedure or

793
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:35,648
form of creativity for anything that we have in shop checklists.

794
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:39,188
Yes. So,

795
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:42,902
this is the form I created for when somebody released the project to us.

796
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:48,439
Isn't the project not- I don't remember any days on safe day requirements manager,

797
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,191
uh, I'm a manager, engineer, customer, um, client. Thanks watching,

798
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:53,959
and I'll see I have information, shipping address,

799
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,049
um,

800
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,952
delivery site, who's handling it,

801
00:46:59,203 --> 00:47:01,779
coding specs. That's better. Umm, well enough,

802
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,720
PDE, a quarter of any of the vitamins are hard here,

803
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:09,787
and the specific project in and so we need to if the engineer pre-ordered

804
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:13,765
any of the materials and the PDE is associated with it.

805
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:18,807
And a lot of times, we don't. Umm,

806
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:22,387
so they'll send us the phase code for what they had,

807
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:24,880
so this is the chain order, so they end up at 18-39.

808
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:30,044
you 1,000-changer in number 9, and they had 63 hours estimated,

809
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,601
so at this point we would then look at it,

810
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,942
and- and we'd try and do our own breakdown,

811
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:37,882
just based upon the view in the print, and then,

812
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:40,511
uhh, as soon as- let's look at it, so we'll have a good day

813
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:45,013
for you. Yeah, and I'm pretty certain it's not estimated

814
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:47,644
even. That's what it is.

815
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,020
Hey, I- . .

816
00:47:54,152 --> 00:47:59,083
So the estimate does

817
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,420
give you that very good.

818
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:05,076
Yeah. But it seems like they take the total and then do their.

819
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:08,095
. So, a lot of it is,

820
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:13,111
um, cause all, all the-

821
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:16,435
it sometimes keep an eye on my own,

822
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:19,060
umm, just like,

823
00:48:19,627 --> 00:48:24,633
burn in um. Bye bye. It will be this hour of many hours,

824
00:48:24,634 --> 00:48:27,334
and then I'll take those hours, look at the burn time,

825
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:31,592
and I'll fill up my thronest. And I'll take a little later of the

826
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:35,762
runtime, and then I'll assume it after our version in 15 minutes,

827
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:40,296
or low in 15 minutes. But I'll load depending upon the scale of the

828
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:42,329
parts that are on there. And so,

829
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,091
burns one and we see a lot of adjustment on.

830
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:49,740
From what Tappa has for doing the perimeter of Vermont for the

831
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:54,132
time calculated in here versus what my latest- the time is saying,

832
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,721
plus we factor union loading normally.

833
00:48:56,956 --> 00:49:01,382
We need to fix that. That's a period of simple- please call the thing

834
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:05,910
to do. So if you're constantly interested and you know what you want

835
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,988
to adjust the thing, that's easy to fix.

836
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:11,893
Cheers. Assume that it fits and it is what I would do so that,

837
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:15,558
that everybody's going to have to re-escalate after this and it's,

838
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,061
you know, me and that having the- I didn't know that right would be

839
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:21,629
another question I would have, you know, so,

840
00:49:21,827 --> 00:49:24,402
you're best. That was one of the issues.

841
00:49:24,403 --> 00:49:27,167
Cheers. What one day was,

842
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:31,194
okay, we're starting to see it, okay, how do we know what work we

843
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:36,343
need to get this to? Nope. We're bringing that off the t-perk

844
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:39,660
cannon from the shot, so, you know, I know if that means that was

845
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:44,271
the only one at a place. This is because what happens is they

846
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,330
go through the hours, they use them under the hours,

847
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:49,171
and if they have a character they want to keep it as before.

848
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:54,186
So they just tell them,

849
00:49:54,187 --> 00:49:57,822
oh, we're going to post it, they have extra time I was doing this,

850
00:49:57,823 --> 00:50:00,026
but at that time, I was going to do it.

851
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:02,659
And that's quite a bit. Yeah,

852
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,131
so, yeah, we can fix that.

853
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:08,777
And people are having a minute meeting with me and playing all this,

854
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:12,411
uh, ninja tips it out. No one really got my face getting cheated.

855
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:14,961
Yeah, so. What We can bet we fix that.

856
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:17,912
Who else can we since change order?

857
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,027
Umm, this one.

858
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:24,110
One. One. One. One.

859
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:27,029
One. One. One.

860
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,617
One. Well,

861
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,854
they're not really estimating sack leather.

862
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:35,466
Estimating the off the field in some little spreadsheet,

863
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:39,189
I sure can get. I'm sure to. So,

864
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,303
that's why it's not intact. I deal with it a lot. I don't know

865
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,600
if you're going to have to be able to use tail. Okay. Okay.

866
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:47,199
Okay. Next slide. Has the end goal and,

867
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:51,017
and so unless one of these,

868
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:55,318
uhm, B or D not- I'm gonna reach out to go out and walk

869
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:59,633
for myself and get us to still work.

870
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:02,632
It has, but this is- Thank This has been an estimated,

871
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:06,987
uhm, more than likely this one was not estimated in total.

872
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,216
Are you useful at happening from up here?

873
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:12,860
But, what is that? That they're actually having access to check within the field?

874
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,653
I have not seen that. I don't know if I go and see if

875
00:51:16,654 --> 00:51:18,715
they're in shock. Bye bye. Sure. Uh,

876
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:21,930
yeah. Yeah, of course. They do it and they have field access to it

877
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:24,340
and the guys know how to use it. If they hand it on the

878
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:28,949
tube, they're just- you there's no more- there's no private care here in Phoenix.

879
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,394
That's one of them. They've got a good field purchase.

880
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:35,163
All good group access. All good girls. Hold I'm a member of the board.

881
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:37,701
Here's the chair of SHUT UP on site. Here's the chair.

882
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:41,926
I was right there today. So, yeah. I need to be- You is that

883
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:45,746
happening? You know,

884
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:50,136
there's probably- Indeed.

885
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:52,307
10 people that are so stuck with it.

886
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,564
And of this giant list of estimators,

887
00:51:55,565 --> 00:52:00,051
umm. This is an online area,

888
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,255
and these are not a few test projects.

889
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:06,037
Umm, I estimated in your office the nights in the-

890
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,274
Guys don't even know how to use that, but that's a little training exercise

891
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:22,000
to get that in. Okay. We'll We'll see you next week.

892
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:22,116
Bye. Bye.

893
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:30,715
Bye. Okay,

894
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:35,366
so here, if I

895
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,296
was here at this point now and it's here again, I will, could I

896
00:52:37,297 --> 00:52:40,375
have them to use the- I have them to be fortunate in fact.

897
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:45,940
I will learn it in the next way or if you can do ?

898
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:45,980
?

899
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:56,527
I was asking, what everything's gonna be right in the back.

900
00:52:56,528 --> 00:52:59,313
I was asking, what can there be a bunch of estimated in here this

901
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,131
week with me? Oh, I'm not even gonna remember.

902
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:04,319
I'll do an expunctive adjustment. So,

903
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,646
you know what? So, where's the best place for me to go on the

904
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:08,907
monitor? And it's just, you gotta use your video.

905
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:12,216
We'll see guys in the show. Uh,

906
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:14,390
yeah, we're listening to this here for a second,

907
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,746
and everyone's got to stand up if a place is so mad.

908
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:21,040
Uh. Bye-bye. Uhm, but it's, we're on the supership.

909
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,562
I get that said, um, shit. You figured out how to let me know,

910
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,721
because I'm going to be able to say, because we're all on you to

911
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:28,396
do it. This guy seems to be the reason they're in a damn street,

912
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:31,768
having him say, hey, I'm gonna do this business.

913
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:34,625
Yeah, you know, I like that, so. Yeah. you Yeah,

914
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:37,182
working with kind of, uh, well,

915
00:53:37,669 --> 00:53:40,680
we're gonna say we're past the days of the,

916
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,244
uh, basic training. Hey. That's it. Okay. That's it.

917
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,392
Except for when there's a bunch of people that aren't usually,

918
00:53:45,393 --> 00:53:47,424
so when you need it, that's it.

919
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,450
That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

920
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:52,472
That's it. That's it. You That's it. That's it. That's it.

921
00:53:52,473 --> 00:53:57,126
First, they have to come

922
00:53:57,127 --> 00:54:01,343
to you. They should also come to one person and say,

923
00:54:01,344 --> 00:54:06,211
well, let's learn how to do spec- Bye-bye.

924
00:54:06,212 --> 00:54:12,166
That's where

925
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,461
we repeat that with lots of issues. It is, uh, we have new estimators

926
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:16,856
that are coming in. And, you know, just doing a lot of takeoffs of,

927
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:19,091
uhm, well,

928
00:54:19,207 --> 00:54:21,905
in the system. Yeah. So, coming in.

929
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:24,393
Good. Good. Going into, uhm,

930
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:26,977
this lower portion down here. But,

931
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,710
not the wrong with the additional labor and,

932
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:32,792
and that. You I don't have any of this to it,

933
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:36,411
but the main layer kind of set up, I'm here at the coast,

934
00:54:36,412 --> 00:54:39,241
but I'm gonna use the cobia on the back. Well, uh. And so,

935
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:43,506
those capture so much more than just any well.

936
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:47,264
Should have been captured can be- But the holes in it,

937
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:50,061
the clips, silencing. I've seen it as the better news.

938
00:54:50,062 --> 00:54:52,304
I've just kind of estimated myself.

939
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:55,418
Yeah. It's insistent. So. I'm going to get out of that sentence.

940
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:59,036
And then he knows we're getting out of here. I'm trying to get next

941
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,038
to me. I'm going to puke. Okay. What's happening?

942
00:55:01,352 --> 00:55:03,626
I'm building. You know. So,

943
00:55:03,627 --> 00:55:09,421
in that, that's one area that we've been uhh,

944
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:12,979
nice to meet us. The job is better, and one of the reasons that

945
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,340
they're allowed would not be an award-driven project,

946
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:18,611
and one of our year-days is that we're so different from the- some of

947
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:21,714
these windows and ears that have come down, they're coming in and doing a

948
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:26,256
lot of well-ticked ops when more of our scene in this community.

949
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:30,891
I'm using labor codes and then using additional labor to fill in a gap

950
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:34,231
where we need additional bullets or so much.

951
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:37,659
And so forth, how many instructions on this lane is that played?

952
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,839
Yeah, they're actually using tech.

953
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,271
Uh, just, I should move it to green.

954
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,600
Three that are dedicated estimators,

955
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,739
so they're also capable to come up, and,

956
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:50,256
yeah, come up, visit, and unbox.

957
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:52,597
Also, with Jesse,

958
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:56,021
um, I think he has to be able to have a certain,

959
00:55:56,476 --> 00:55:58,706
you know, to read and learn to be. . . So,

960
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:03,437
if, if he estimates himself, it's probably forever being heavy bit,

961
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:06,276
and he's probably more estimated in the.

962
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:09,913
. . Okay. If you look at the portion of it, anything fat,

963
00:56:10,044 --> 00:56:13,066
it's associated with Jesse, the department usually is Tristan Crowe,

964
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:15,616
her arms are, And we'll see your estimator.

965
00:56:16,074 --> 00:56:18,511
And, uh, where do you listen to it? But they get it in the

966
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:22,291
giver. They have a fourth floor. I'm I'm just I'm this.

967
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:24,938
A third floor. So, I'm gonna third floor.

968
00:56:24,939 --> 00:56:27,905
But I'm gonna be especially. I'm gonna keep coming here all week.

969
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:30,276
And then we go all the last week. Now I'm gonna be here.

970
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:32,366
Yeah. Okay, I'll sit with,

971
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,678
like, a fishbowl set of officers, Jesse,

972
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,781
and one of those with a PSN outside of his office. I'm going go

973
00:56:36,782 --> 00:56:40,306
ahead and I don't think that's even the first word.

974
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:42,732
Is that an image of a visual of a lot for somebody who's done

975
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,124
it if you can get a normal word or other one? I don't know.

976
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,756
I don't know. So,

977
00:56:47,757 --> 00:56:50,105
I'm all in.

978
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,406
I keep going back to the, ah, I think I'm in.

979
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,734
Yeah, we can- doing this integration stuff. That's not a big deal.

980
00:56:56,735 --> 00:56:58,739
Umm,

981
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,420
I swear they were having been very well spent.

982
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,260
We'll see in a minute. Yes. Yeah,

983
00:57:04,261 --> 00:57:07,723
I agree with you. Yep. Uh, uh,

984
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:10,291
I think you're getting more by and improving your audio.

985
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:13,170
I'll skip the hours from now to the early this week.

986
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:17,824
Uhm, I-I think we've had-we-we'd be better

987
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:21,607
off. Well, I'm doing this now. We can make these labor hurts too.

988
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:24,505
Exactly, but, uh, that endling.

989
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:29,753
Go ahead. You can't

990
00:57:29,754 --> 00:57:33,487
think that the world's government.

991
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:36,332
We can make this exactly that if you want. Go. That's, that,

992
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,909
that would be a hell of a lot better.

993
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,336
I love watching, doing a bunch of night to figure out.

994
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:47,375
That is, and that's another area where we have confusion is the layout

995
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:50,018
of the handling, the layout of the fit.

996
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:52,054
Good. Most of the time it goes in the fit,

997
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:56,847
and then, um, but we also have the fit of category and U,

998
00:57:56,858 --> 00:57:59,246
so category. I wish I had five hands up,

999
00:57:59,247 --> 00:58:02,500
and we're going one category, and then we got weld,

1000
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:05,537
and then we have clean material handling,

1001
00:58:05,538 --> 00:58:10,260
and, but. So, if we simplify these labor groups

1002
00:58:10,261 --> 00:58:13,662
out to basically what my P***** has on it,

1003
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:17,016
yeah. Uh, with the exception of needing to add burn to this,

1004
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:19,839
then we're going to keep getting the consistent rate.

1005
00:58:20,057 --> 00:58:22,351
So, are you in the basket of this tone here?

1006
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:25,753
Yeah, so why not fix it?

1007
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:28,328
Yeah. So, um,

1008
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:33,087
I'm hoping to, uh, uhm- I think what that would be flash there

1009
00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:35,393
should be, we don't know. This, this, this integration,

1010
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:39,532
act, act with the fix is, then we- We can set it and set

1011
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:42,584
it up relatively quickly through,

1012
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,040
which is giving you the breakdown of the Halloween.

1013
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:47,183
Bye, thanks again too. You want, right?

1014
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:50,531
We're bringing all this and I'm just gonna have it.

1015
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,028
So, um, so, I'll just suggest.

1016
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,767
Just. Here, you just, then, you know,

1017
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:59,105
stay on the bottom and then we'll bring you back and go back and

1018
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:02,371
donate these. Right? All right.

1019
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,615
I'm glad you did. If you can't get me filled, you're late.

1020
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:07,228
I haven't seen it. I've seen it. it. I've seen it.

1021
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:10,060
I'm glad you did. I'll next video.

1022
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:15,427
And we'll see Okay. I

1023
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:17,946
think it's gonna be, it's gonna freak out on your dad's.

1024
00:59:17,947 --> 00:59:19,636
She's gonna have to be in bed. So. Heh.

1025
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:31,411
Heh. Heh. also able to return it here that we just have everything

1026
00:59:31,412 --> 00:59:35,266
to do with cutting was 1-3-9.

1027
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,441
Things are pressed for- 1-3, water jet,

1028
00:59:37,442 --> 00:59:43,456
1-9. Everything to do what's fit out was 10-19.

1029
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:46,551
Everything to do- with welding. So,

1030
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:50,878
we just had things in groups of 10. Because somebody wanted- sometimes somebody would

1031
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,669
say, well, I want welding. Thank you for us today. For this and welding

1032
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,974
for that. It was made within a century.

1033
00:59:56,137 --> 01:00:00,077
It was made within the same family. Yeah. That's just the way I'm used

1034
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:02,210
to- doing it, not having it all over the place.

1035
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:05,110
And then when you make the routing, the routing,

1036
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:08,251
and blow it through the shop. Thank you very much.

1037
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:11,031
I believe, by the way, uhm,

1038
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:15,224
what's the activity on this production?

1039
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,702
Good production. It,

1040
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:21,136
it, it has one effect in the instrument,

1041
01:00:21,137 --> 01:00:23,530
uhm, specifically,

1042
01:00:23,531 --> 01:00:24,228
like, if you don't.

1043
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:38,920
You know what about your, your, your, your, uh, just a separate care? You

1044
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:42,645
just get that, right? Good. Yeah, I think it's really hard to include it

1045
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:45,335
in all of it. Uh, yeah, I think the most part is just the

1046
01:00:45,336 --> 01:00:48,692
ones with the auto clips. Yeah, and my, uh, uh, like,

1047
01:00:49,684 --> 01:00:52,861
H and I are very common ones that we use.

1048
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:56,231
I've been telling them that it really has been a second.

1049
01:00:56,232 --> 01:01:00,247
Okay. . And then,

1050
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:05,036
10 minutes, and then And we have,

1051
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:07,570
in there, type H, quarter, H, type H,

1052
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:09,770
5, 16, type H, pattern,

1053
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:12,165
3, 8. So, as the.

1054
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,452
So, The filler, it says increases, umm,

1055
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:19,395
you can just plop that, leave it good and just cool.

1056
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,642
I'm cutting. Hallelujah. I'm not gonna question your cutting.

1057
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:25,518
Umm, so you got plate plasma cutting,

1058
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,836
but you've also got, plasma shape cutting.

1059
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,219
And then you got softening.

1060
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:37,351
So, size-

1061
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:44,767
What is plasma cutting complete? Perfect. What is plasma cutting shapes?

1062
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:47,056
Thanks. Still sucked.

1063
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,788
So, how do you differentiate the time it takes to socket something versus

1064
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,864
burst? I'm gonna cut the shape. So,

1065
01:01:55,865 --> 01:01:57,867
with, with that,

1066
01:01:57,868 --> 01:02:00,083
uhm,

1067
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:03,185
I guess we got it really, We haven't really broken that out,

1068
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,789
and that's another area where we've been trying to fine tune this.

1069
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,396
I'll pull the, uh, pull the reports.

1070
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:13,277
We're on land tech, and see what their runtimes are,

1071
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:17,376
and anything. Thank you.

1072
01:02:17,377 --> 01:02:22,201
Associated with that, all the separate colors of

1073
01:02:22,202 --> 01:02:26,785
this Azure ACPC time, associated with this. Subs.co.uk for running

1074
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:30,248
channels and needles. And uhh,

1075
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,421
that's always stuck into our pocket.

1076
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:37,032
Uhm. Um Because if the ACPC goes down and it's just more

1077
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:39,565
common than I like it can ever be, uhm,

1078
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:43,061
I think it just goes past it. So. on. And if you still have

1079
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:45,454
fun, if you still have the minutes, or whatever,

1080
01:02:46,005 --> 01:02:49,160
you can't see me as far as that.

1081
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:51,511
All right. I have time for you to invest in my view,

1082
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,100
regardless of what, what is,

1083
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:57,044
what do you think of this, but, this is so awesome.

1084
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:59,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, all those, uh, that kind of notion,

1085
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:02,488
ah. But what would you, what would you see normally in the shop if

1086
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:06,262
you have different cutting centers? We'll see you in the end of your front

1087
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:10,236
toes. Most of the balance you've got to know if it doesn't matter how

1088
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:13,411
to cut it. But they're not driving it.

1089
01:03:13,412 --> 01:03:16,750
You spoke to me about estimating it,

1090
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:19,821
and I had something that was twice as fast as something else.

1091
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:27,390
My ball would be- Yeah,

1092
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:28,675
and they're not making that decision all day, so when it's morning, when it's

1093
01:03:28,676 --> 01:03:30,018
morning, when All right. And through this, you're to go and it can be,

1094
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:32,539
it's just so important to me to take this,

1095
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,561
this amount of time. When it goes by,

1096
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:36,746
unfortunately that's about a slack. Yeah,

1097
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,978
that's about one. Okay, um, I mean,

1098
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:43,599
I can see huge differences in the time of

1099
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:45,722
the job. No. No. Yeah,

1100
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:47,731
but I have to show you the editing time. But,

1101
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:51,353
you know, most of the time, about 40 or 20 years will be cut

1102
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:52,887
on one machine. Alright.

1103
01:04:01,476 --> 01:04:04,203
I kind of believe in my, this channel's on the right,

1104
01:04:04,204 --> 01:04:07,602
and they don't have any jig that's peeps, so they're all kind of a

1105
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:10,432
bit more self-made. I guess I'm tired. I can't big buy out,

1106
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:12,937
you know, but often it was simply buy out,

1107
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:16,146
you in front of somebody that doesn't be minding that.

1108
01:04:16,265 --> 01:04:18,854
They don't tell it. When they get to be minded,

1109
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,800
we can cut, transfer, put holes in it,

1110
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:25,353
and mark. It's grabbing me. Last year.

1111
01:04:25,354 --> 01:04:27,540
you You know, year alone,

1112
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:30,750
we spent $700,000 in selling our beans.

1113
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:34,241
And, uh, it was a cheap and a bean furniture.

1114
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:37,938
Like a wipe-down, with a wipe-down axe.

1115
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:40,857
I have no idea what it was supposed to be.

1116
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:44,183
Bye. Well, you can, uh, build a little more.

1117
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,342
It's very expensive. Yeah, nice. Now I don't achieve it.

1118
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:49,365
But I won't believe it. I'm a bit death-cated problem.

1119
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:54,153
around. But I don't believe that I would get it to 7 I would.

1120
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,724
I don't think we're long term in. What? Where? We'll see you ever do.

1121
01:04:57,725 --> 01:05:01,008
I think I might be five years from now.

1122
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:04,170
If I think I might need the full system,

1123
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:07,278
uhm, uh, soft. You know, a drill, a giver,

1124
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:10,860
yeah. And I'm going to buy something that can be part of the system

1125
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:13,531
that I can add to you know. You've got to play with it.

1126
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:16,304
But, unfortunately, it's a full system thing.

1127
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:19,050
Yeah, I-I want it better. I want it,

1128
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:21,511
uh, automation of the movement of the,

1129
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:24,535
I don't want to go out of the jinglish neighborhood and stuff.

1130
01:05:24,906 --> 01:05:27,114
So that man, I want it to sit and that works.

1131
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:29,167
Yeah, it's, uh, uh,

1132
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:31,724
we a- you don't buy that much. That's it.

1133
01:05:31,725 --> 01:05:34,686
I'm a real. I've crossed it out.

1134
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:37,536
Portland, Fyster, Fythonx. Thanks.

1135
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:40,447
Yeah. I've priced him out. Yeah.

1136
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:42,852
He's about how he turns the week you want to do.

1137
01:05:43,278 --> 01:05:45,576
Hey, Justin. Really? Hey, do this. This is,

1138
01:05:53,556 --> 01:05:58,556
i

1139
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:14,570
And

1140
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,750
probably the same with barber mitzel oil.

1141
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:23,939
Go. I'm

1142
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,540
sorry. Open the margin, man. I'm not gonna get care. Let that.

1143
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:34,273
We'll see I

1144
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:36,844
think next week I'm gonna go get over. . . I'm just thinking that

1145
01:06:36,845 --> 01:06:39,557
you monitor yourself a little bit and see what I'm doing.

1146
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:43,951
I'm going to do that and it's hugely active today.

1147
01:06:43,952 --> 01:06:46,803
I'm going more of a minute, maybe finish this, and that's my next thing.

1148
01:06:46,804 --> 01:06:49,224
I'm a lot of time in that practice.

1149
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:52,455
I'm going to put a little bit about five minutes. Or, you know,

1150
01:06:52,456 --> 01:06:54,571
it's there. And the first one,

1151
01:06:54,572 --> 01:06:57,424
you know, like, I'm going to get a boxing turn like something,

1152
01:06:57,425 --> 01:07:00,740
okay? And then I'm bleeding, you know. you won't be I take the 3-7

1153
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:03,477
o'clock to get married and that's when people start to straw in it.

1154
01:07:05,765 --> 01:07:08,071
You lose a gun, people come right after me, don't you?

1155
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:10,225
You used to be an idiot right about showing up in six.

1156
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,397
Okay. I'm going to do a tour of you.

1157
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:16,116
Don't blow it nearly up. You're playing.

1158
01:07:16,117 --> 01:07:19,979
I'm going to move over to the big corporate office at eight o'clock straight.

1159
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:22,666
That was the one on the board to think about everything.

1160
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:27,109
You know. I want to. I'm going to tear it once. You know,

1161
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:29,472
you probably want, uh, since,

1162
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:31,844
uh, your, since cravings will be in here,

1163
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:35,236
the end. You want, uh, clean at the paint,

1164
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:41,750
as well. Boom. Is that material handling

1165
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:45,340
of that label there? Is that what is the material doing with that?

1166
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:49,385
It just allowed another file. By the way,

1167
01:07:49,386 --> 01:07:53,234
newer is it? No, that one we can wrap up in just update to

1168
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,756
just clean. Uh, but that's,

1169
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:59,909
that's more- one area that I'm not alone with.

1170
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,325
One area of confusion we've had on the past,

1171
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:04,361
since we haven't seen very good sort of material. Two y'all.

1172
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:09,361
Umm,

1173
01:08:09,874 --> 01:08:12,513
so, but we can address that, uh, so that it's- ehm,

1174
01:08:12,514 --> 01:08:17,332
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm. keep up with the full panel,

1175
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,479
do you have fun with the partial panel,

1176
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,331
fun for the basic world? Okay, uhm, everything doesn't mean to talk about the

1177
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,629
boxy, everything doesn't mean to talk anywhere,

1178
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:28,471
I'm just going anywhere. Okay, now I'm gonna be sweating out.

1179
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:31,567
It doesn't have any water to drink. Hah,

1180
01:08:31,568 --> 01:08:34,380
hah, hah. That's a good point.

1181
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:36,571
If we come up there, if you have water to buy it.

1182
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:38,789
We're not in these things, aren't in order, like, for those,

1183
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:41,292
like, yeah, all of a sudden,

1184
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:43,555
you know, water can gather to start a loop.

1185
01:08:43,556 --> 01:08:46,321
That's why I used to it. I mean, yeah, that kind of makes sense,

1186
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,926
you know, I've got to work with them, and he's in the long run

1187
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:51,190
for a nice and career to say, you know,

1188
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:54,222
I've got to start a few years ago. My last year,

1189
01:08:54,223 --> 01:08:56,259
uhm, uhm, I guess,

1190
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,461
you know, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

1191
01:08:59,434 --> 01:09:02,076
and it'll be fun to see them. I see that group on,

1192
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:04,314
click, click, click, click, and it'll be in.

1193
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,565
Oh, is that right? Just leave the plane in the landing room. Oh, okay,

1194
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:11,052
so that would be You don't see that in the afternoon.

1195
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:13,440
They're going through, it's like, in these options.

1196
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:17,137
The main thing we're getting right now is when they pull up- with their

1197
01:09:17,138 --> 01:09:22,229
estimate summary, all of these descriptions are available

1198
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:26,238
to get out of these different- I have to go running up across so

1199
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:29,262
we need to put them on here on the box or do they haven't.

1200
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,703
Either on the box, they have to be there,

1201
01:09:31,704 --> 01:09:34,374
they have to show the- but they already have both of them on the

1202
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:36,704
paper side of it. Yep. Now,

1203
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:41,082
this one's- this one's given to us by a technical guide and be- you

1204
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:43,726
know, I think we've really done, I guess,

1205
01:09:44,674 --> 01:09:47,815
maybe any custom ones in there. Umm,

1206
01:09:47,826 --> 01:09:53,183
but we got- Thank you. So that's

1207
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:58,667
one of one of

1208
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:04,700
our forests.

1209
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,911
on own. I will have a and ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

1210
01:10:06,946 --> 01:10:11,461
ehm, ehm, ehm. in the United States, but I'm happy to get an understanding

1211
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:13,956
of it last time. I mean,

1212
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,319
go ahead and read what you can ask. I'll do that shit.

1213
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:18,995
Yeah. That's, I've done it,

1214
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,670
you know, they said all the other things. And it's like,

1215
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:24,608
it's one of my stuff that I used to have a time I used

1216
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:27,151
to do, you And for me, it's amazing,

1217
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:30,705
it's, ah. I'll, I'll kill. I can say two clicks,

1218
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:33,541
I don't know if it has a lot of numbers. Yeah,

1219
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:37,057
yeah. One thing I-

1220
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:48,230
Of course, do not have that in it. If I have a little committee,

1221
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,658
then you have to have to make sure all of this.

1222
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:52,871
That's what happened. I'm big, tic.

1223
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:56,422
Good. I want to give a global man of,

1224
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:58,885
uh, uh, uh, the Family,

1225
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:01,129
uh, so you can see every bite and all that.

1226
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,750
Go. Yeah, because I never seen an email and get me a drink.

1227
01:11:04,877 --> 01:11:06,925
So I don't want to dust everything at all.

1228
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:17,311
Now I'm not a chance. And it's a very- You and

1229
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:19,416
intindically, it's last, cause now I'm like,

1230
01:11:19,417 --> 01:11:21,420
3 foot of well, and then there's ehm,

1231
01:11:22,265 --> 01:11:24,636
or 1. But, uh,

1232
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,265
I mean, it's-

1233
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:35,726
From the detail or from the type of testing.

1234
01:11:35,993 --> 01:11:39,234
Okay. I was happy to hear from the detail I would think that I'd

1235
01:11:39,235 --> 01:11:41,431
see my thing, because you're more pending.

1236
01:11:41,432 --> 01:11:44,246
You can do some model of your application. No,

1237
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:46,570
that would be a real question. But I think,

1238
01:11:46,571 --> 01:11:49,220
uh, the detail I can turn the level off on the head,

1239
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,763
Umm,

1240
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:57,120
yeah, no, there's no one. I submit a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.

1241
01:11:56,994 --> 01:12:00,486
Yes, ma'am. I take one hit. We have to have a little bit.

1242
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:03,045
Yeah, and they see, believe it, from a movement.

1243
01:12:03,046 --> 01:12:05,556
Cause that one's ruining her clip, believe it.

1244
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:08,035
. So you open, click, believe it.

1245
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,353
Cause you can't even go in and highlight all of them.

1246
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:12,773
And believe, you have to go one, one.

1247
01:12:12,883 --> 01:12:18,861
Bye So now we can, we can get them in and joint everything

1248
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:21,631
to the new box. And then we'll come back in.

1249
01:12:21,632 --> 01:12:23,810
We can just leave the rest of the crap out.

1250
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:26,493
And then we'll have a much more simplified. So,

1251
01:12:27,096 --> 01:12:29,736
you get our operations to do that. I think we're like a re-

1252
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:41,443
hmmm. So, this is where we just want to get it going to the

1253
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:44,647
right area. So, this is a little bit tedious.

1254
01:12:44,648 --> 01:12:47,137
Yes, well. So,

1255
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:50,629
uhm, it might be easiest to say,

1256
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,237
like, sort my, uh, labor group here.

1257
01:12:53,246 --> 01:12:56,513
you And then just re-point the groupings.

1258
01:12:58,063 --> 01:13:00,301
Check where we're going to go. If you need that,

1259
01:13:00,302 --> 01:13:03,782
send it out, come to th- I know that it will say,

1260
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:06,213
we don't. That time,

1261
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:09,764
so I'll get rid of these and ask them again. I think there is

1262
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:14,051
no- I don't want me to get in the,

1263
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:16,687
uh, time, and then we need to swear. Hmmm.

1264
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:21,728
No,

1265
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:24,691
I think we can just, just,

1266
01:13:25,536 --> 01:13:30,584
is that- Right now, anything in quality control-wise is- there's

1267
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:33,697
a separate, empty bucket that's added to every project.

1268
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:38,032
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you can just add some kind of tune- I think

1269
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:41,076
it will- You've got to check it, every moment- you've seen everyone be saying

1270
01:13:41,077 --> 01:13:43,114
it individually. And so you go, yeah,

1271
01:13:43,155 --> 01:13:45,651
I'm gonna check this one out and check it out. Well,

1272
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:48,892
then see how the park is. I mean, the fidders should be going their

1273
01:13:48,893 --> 01:13:51,958
own checks. Yeah. So, uh,

1274
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,880
most of this check time gets fun to go around with that time.

1275
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,828
But, let me check it done by the end.

1276
01:13:57,829 --> 01:14:03,325
Yeah. I don't know if you were a shot that was doing nothing

1277
01:14:03,326 --> 01:14:06,806
but the thousands of operations. And going to that we don't have you to

1278
01:14:06,807 --> 01:14:10,142
have a couple of things, but when I see a gear it's more,

1279
01:14:11,756 --> 01:14:15,522
it's like, I'll check, a B. Thank you. Yeah,

1280
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:18,223
yeah.

1281
01:14:18,224 --> 01:14:21,180
Sometimes the only spot to lean on the spot shape that we're going to

1282
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:23,313
get into games. James. When you go to check, I'm going to be on

1283
01:14:23,314 --> 01:14:25,462
that. I'm trying to get a good one. Well, I walked a couple of

1284
01:14:25,463 --> 01:14:27,479
them a couple of days ago,

1285
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,823
and I could see marks on. Yeah.

1286
01:14:29,824 --> 01:14:34,365
Umm. Like somebody and put a clip on and

1287
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:38,491
then groundly off properly or whatever. Thank you very much.

1288
01:14:38,492 --> 01:14:41,071
Alright.

1289
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:38,980
forward.

1290
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:12,664
What purpose?

1291
01:15:13,845 --> 01:15:17,171
Yeah. I could send it out to you by the way.

1292
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:20,437
But if he just said it like you. Get good then.

1293
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,549
Yeah, I don't know if the music can do it. So,

1294
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:27,516
I mean, if you get what I said, I said, I mean.

1295
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:29,974
It does the uh, he works a chat,

1296
01:15:29,975 --> 01:15:34,511
but it's worth it. He does all of the hardware and hardware controls for

1297
01:15:34,512 --> 01:15:36,740
the Christmas money, son. And that makes him PC,

1298
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,998
so he's a part of his car, so he's like,

1299
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,199
I have to remove me in the van, isn't it?

1300
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,018
Yes. See guys soon. He's actually looking,

1301
01:15:45,019 --> 01:15:48,132
you know, more of their dad, so I can get him a bike at

1302
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:50,515
risk to try to get him in, uh,

1303
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:53,467
integration. You know, that would be super sweet,

1304
01:15:53,468 --> 01:15:57,196
but yeah, yeah, well, so, obviously we've got those in the system because of,

1305
01:15:57,197 --> 01:16:00,580
uhm, it's here, and maybe- I've got a new update,

1306
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:02,976
and I'm just following all of the settings,

1307
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:05,331
and I have a meaning to put it into my stuff, because they don't

1308
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:08,047
offer any sort of, uh, guide my- I don't know.

1309
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:10,446
I don't know if you can read about April Permanual,

1310
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,442
but it means the feed rates, but it means cut qualities,

1311
01:16:13,754 --> 01:16:17,435
and it's- It's fine. I know how to do that instead,

1312
01:16:17,436 --> 01:16:20,017
and you train me how it's gonna go as well, but yeah.

1313
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,379
But if I'm fine,

1314
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,575
uhm, I'm- She's back in the room.

1315
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:27,571
Yeah. By my location, and you're gonna call hangout train,

1316
01:16:27,572 --> 01:16:29,639
I'm on a 360 stainless right now.

1317
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,198
So, thank you. Don't- Good bye. . But,

1318
01:16:32,199 --> 01:16:35,994
uh, I'm doing a- I'm doing a website for support.

1319
01:16:35,998 --> 01:16:39,576
I guess it's perfect. And I'm gonna have a spot in the head.

1320
01:16:39,577 --> 01:16:44,125
More than more than I will have where clients can get

1321
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:47,449
together and talk about this at ACPC. I'm going a motion that I can

1322
01:16:47,551 --> 01:16:49,827
get to ACPC. Here's why I'm sure we're going to be about to get

1323
01:16:49,828 --> 01:16:52,322
this out, and I'm going to just show them that all there,

1324
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:55,004
sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Having me,

1325
01:16:55,005 --> 01:16:57,411
uh. Yeah. The chat boards for us.

1326
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,149
The chat boards for us.

1327
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:03,512
I'm going to have, like, monthly web hours.

1328
01:17:03,513 --> 01:17:05,495
You just go through where I'm from. I'm to try to get some of

1329
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:08,502
these guys to come all over the same. Let's listen to you play,

1330
01:17:08,503 --> 01:17:10,512
because it's even better to say what they're playing in it. Umm,

1331
01:17:10,523 --> 01:17:11,616
yeah. Yeah.

1332
01:17:20,082 --> 01:17:22,436
I'm definitely interested in that. Because, uhm, I'm s- I mean, not only am

1333
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,746
I, I mean, once you're in the industry, you're in the industry.

1334
01:17:24,868 --> 01:17:27,002
Yeah. So, uh, in the minority of us,

1335
01:17:27,003 --> 01:17:30,676
you're there. It's awesome. Yeah. It's a, it's a normal institute.

1336
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:36,139
So, so, you should, or do you decide

1337
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,181
on that or do you want to do that? There. Uhh,

1338
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:41,408
this one we will put into the art.

1339
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,458
So, I'm gonna say we put on a check. Thank you. Okay. I will

1340
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:47,120
read.

1341
01:17:53,611 --> 01:17:57,445
Because they need to do that.

1342
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:02,727
I want to follow me. A

1343
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:05,372
bunch of you like it. I can't even know.

1344
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:08,187
So, you're, so it really is.

1345
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:10,596
The quality guy is not responsible anymore.

1346
01:18:10,597 --> 01:18:13,715
It's just the better this was possible.

1347
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:17,848
So, the better it is, checking if it's required.

1348
01:18:18,142 --> 01:18:24,274
water. And then the QC comes over with a thumbs up inspection report.

1349
01:18:24,564 --> 01:18:26,616
So, QC is still.

1350
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,941
The ring, the check. But,

1351
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:34,404
you see the rest of our track on the separate code on the Anderson

1352
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:37,838
part. . . Okay. So, you see those where to put their time on

1353
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:40,631
the project. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's the only order,

1354
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:43,185
the only order to get this premium. Umm,

1355
01:18:43,195 --> 01:18:46,218
this project schedule, which you can see me,

1356
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:50,300
this is a renovation time in here. Umm. I will see Bye.

1357
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:54,041
See you next You know, I'm It's the same code for every single project.

1358
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:58,202
But, I'm just a man without that, I'm trying to say her to me.

1359
01:18:58,203 --> 01:19:02,085
in the In the first generation of this two topics would be just- probably.

1360
01:19:02,753 --> 01:19:04,868
Yeah, we would see the behavior. So,

1361
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:09,587
yeah, where's failure? See guys next I have some expected them all to get

1362
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:12,379
your troubles away 0-1-14-0.

1363
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,616
So. Go.

1364
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:18,770
I don't think they would call about all this weekend's about 3-1-4-0.

1365
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:23,716
Okay, we're going to move on to the next and I cannot normally get

1366
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:27,009
it in here so that people can say it wasn't that I mean.

1367
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:30,360
Otherwise, I've done this for 2-2-2-0.

1368
01:19:30,631 --> 01:19:35,219
You have very common good, and then you can paste it there rather than

1369
01:19:35,727 --> 01:19:38,611
have to be able to click through and find it.

1370
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:43,503
What do you think about how you call

1371
01:19:43,934 --> 01:19:47,611
it? Enjoy the video. Have a good one? I don't know.

1372
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:52,611
You

1373
01:19:52,907 --> 01:19:55,891
can also look at it from the leg and group on the leg.

1374
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:59,012
I have to, it'll stay on, check in with you so I can sprawl

1375
01:19:59,018 --> 01:19:59,543
up you. Thank

1376
01:20:03,931 --> 01:20:08,931
I'll

1377
01:20:09,878 --> 01:20:11,971
tell you, I'm gonna stop that, please.

1378
01:20:11,972 --> 01:20:15,207
Like, I, I got some sickness for a little bit.

1379
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:15,585
Thank you.

1380
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:22,060
Ehm, ehm,

1381
01:20:22,061 --> 01:20:22,230
You

1382
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:31,362
I can't be very fast today.

1383
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:34,092
I'm gonna stop stepping down. Let's do that.

1384
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:36,992
Totally, I was trying to leave the same house. Let's let's go. That's very

1385
01:20:36,993 --> 01:20:39,935
good, and it's modest. Thank you.

1386
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:45,970
Thank I'm

1387
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:48,465
going to take part in my ability to grab things to go inside and

1388
01:20:48,466 --> 01:20:53,348
apply to that. Alright. Let me see,

1389
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:58,275
just don't get

1390
01:20:58,276 --> 01:20:59,816
it and get it.

1391
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:13,020
.

1392
01:21:16,296 --> 01:21:19,636
I it's a little quick because I'm drinking a lot of the fish because

1393
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:24,069
I didn't. Ah, I'm thinking I'm certain that I have migrated.

1394
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,277
Have a great day.

1395
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:45,174
So, have you heard or are you aware that the goal

1396
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:48,691
is to have all estimators or all of some of these people?

1397
01:21:48,692 --> 01:21:52,862
That's the goal of the way I understand it.

1398
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:55,860
So, uhm. I know.

1399
01:21:55,472 --> 01:22:00,101
Okay. I can't really tell if

1400
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:04,549
some people are, but it looks like there's some here.

1401
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:07,394
Church. Well, some might be in cattle shops,

1402
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:11,039
and might be in the same thing as you leave between beer and gilbert.

1403
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,138
Church, gilbert.

1404
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,919
You k. Morning, libr. Orange. Okay.-gilbert.

1405
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,381
G. And that is run by the guy in float.

1406
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:22,630
Cause they go. So, I'm all up to Denver.

1407
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:28,195
See, like, the lead estimators in there. This is what I've heard.

1408
01:22:28,196 --> 01:22:32,816
I haven't been verified either. We'll you in the next video. The facility

1409
01:22:32,817 --> 01:22:34,922
in Great Falls is empty.

1410
01:22:34,923 --> 01:22:39,543
It's like, it's only about that. Well, we'll see that's for the overhead

1411
01:22:39,544 --> 01:22:44,908
cranes, but there's hardly any more people. They're the facility of

1412
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:47,500
low field. You know, there's oil field skidders.

1413
01:22:48,637 --> 01:22:52,491
There's a lot of this. I don't know if you know all these places.

1414
01:22:52,492 --> 01:22:58,024
Nice. Ah. I'm researching hard to

1415
01:22:58,025 --> 01:23:00,259
be people that run trip reports,

1416
01:23:01,138 --> 01:23:05,459
you know. You come on, come on.

1417
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:09,052
Anyway, place in Casper and I have no idea what they did that.

1418
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:13,595
you Hey, I'm trying to

1419
01:23:13,596 --> 01:23:16,853
pull data from these facilities.

1420
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:18,708
Like, who's been there when?

1421
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:29,463
In the different parts of the complex,

1422
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:31,721
I don't know what the language is about.

1423
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:34,913
I don't know anything to say. I don't know what to say. I can

1424
01:23:34,914 --> 01:23:38,981
walk in or falls in it. Then I can see that so I can

1425
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:42,105
either say, I now know what we can do here.

1426
01:23:42,106 --> 01:23:43,219
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1427
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,635
I'm amazing, Bye.

1428
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:01,024
Ten foot shear, ten foot prospect,

1429
01:24:01,365 --> 01:24:04,396
and then you have two stairs here and there, and they have this little

1430
01:24:04,397 --> 01:24:09,329
invitation name on. You can do their spare And they're not really

1431
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,865
set up to do structural,

1432
01:24:11,866 --> 01:24:14,251
like, calls baby soon. The rest is what it is. We'll see you next

1433
01:24:14,252 --> 01:24:17,380
week. He's saying, you know, we say it all around in my house.

1434
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:20,382
Okay. Oh, doesn't become any more of the sterling dust.

1435
01:24:20,383 --> 01:24:25,184
I know, but I don't think I

1436
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:28,210
don't think so. They're trying to get to this point to where they're doing

1437
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,751
one with the in-house. We're good at the joint.

1438
01:24:30,752 --> 01:24:36,832
One of these shops

1439
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:37,133
have been in these states. Okay, so I think you and I have been

1440
01:24:37,134 --> 01:24:40,769
sold. all the time. very similar thing.

1441
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,512
I just want to get in terms of where it's best and if I

1442
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:46,771
can't find facility that we don't.

1443
01:24:46,772 --> 01:24:50,156
That's the best. They might be getting my day of time where we can

1444
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:52,267
buy it out. It's not good. Okay.

1445
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:56,397
I think we have a very similar question. But coming,

1446
01:24:56,516 --> 01:24:59,019
yours is coming for John Snow. Yeah,

1447
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,604
mine's coming from Jeffrey. But I think that it's so neat.

1448
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:06,030
You know, he's the same thing that John is a very bad actress.

1449
01:25:06,031 --> 01:25:08,239
Oh, really? Yeah, he's eating vocal.

1450
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,959
He works from Paul, and he's here today. Oh,

1451
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,018
he's here on Monday.

1452
01:25:14,019 --> 01:25:16,086
He'll be here on Thursday. I don't know. I wonder if you should do

1453
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:18,811
anything. So he's my little boss.

1454
01:25:18,812 --> 01:25:21,421
. . . for a decade, we work,

1455
01:25:21,422 --> 01:25:22,253
uh, yeah.

1456
01:25:26,796 --> 01:25:29,019
shop is crumbling, uhm,

1457
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:32,213
because most of us have left, because that's for whatever reason.

1458
01:25:32,852 --> 01:25:37,378
Some is rebuilding. Little bit. They've taken seven of our guys over there,

1459
01:25:38,186 --> 01:25:40,905
and they're putting up 65,000 square feet.

1460
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:45,842
New facility. a little bit. One big time,

1461
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:48,633
one big thanks,

1462
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:50,375
one big special. Please get one of our girls personal service. You got it.

1463
01:25:50,376 --> 01:25:53,419
it. It's good. It's good. It's good.

1464
01:25:53,558 --> 01:25:57,908
Around this area of data, in most organized ways,

1465
01:25:57,909 --> 01:26:01,409
is still that. I have bad.

1466
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:03,369
I have not been still bad. I've heard of it. But yeah. So you

1467
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:06,811
know in this facility, but you guys are the next day of steel.

1468
01:26:06,812 --> 01:26:08,826
And yeah, I did not know that. Right,

1469
01:26:08,827 --> 01:26:11,272
guys, we're at next door. And the end is,

1470
01:26:11,626 --> 01:26:14,397
yeah, do the servo on the side. So we're right there.

1471
01:26:14,398 --> 01:26:17,269
And then we'll go. Okay. And then they move here.

1472
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,432
A.S. deal has expanded. Yes,

1473
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:21,595
they have. They've never done that, but.

1474
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:26,760
But you have. A.S. deal with the people that upper level

1475
01:26:27,286 --> 01:26:30,816
benefit over the densities.

1476
01:26:30,817 --> 01:26:32,947
I've looked at that for sure. Yep,

1477
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:38,851
I had the three big three about me.

1478
01:26:38,852 --> 01:26:41,115
. . . I give the power that the three had dragged, and then

1479
01:26:41,116 --> 01:26:44,929
me, and then brought up soon after me. And then I laughed at the

1480
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,054
three, like most people were not stupid. this. They only lasted a year or

1481
01:26:49,055 --> 01:26:51,309
two. It's something along the door.

1482
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,247
It's super scary. What I am being here,

1483
01:26:54,248 --> 01:26:57,201
they said. Yeah, yeah,

1484
01:26:57,202 --> 01:26:59,835
that's better.

1485
01:26:59,836 --> 01:27:02,480
And it's better.

1486
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:07,276
just jump up then

1487
01:27:07,277 --> 01:27:10,836
on cusses where everybody will they go.

1488
01:27:10,837 --> 01:27:12,955
. And if there is, there it is now.

1489
01:27:13,334 --> 01:27:15,688
I think it's easier than that because I didn't knew that one.

1490
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,871
It's not my head except for it. Let's see if it's your word.

1491
01:27:18,872 --> 01:27:26,333
That's great people. But this part is

1492
01:27:26,334 --> 01:27:29,867
the shot really, you know. You It is that it's really good.

1493
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:32,597
It's made out of really good equipment.

1494
01:27:34,154 --> 01:27:36,611
One more week shot. Go. Yeah.

1495
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,863
There can be one. Yeah.

1496
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:44,443
One kitchen's going to be utility for them to build.

1497
01:27:44,444 --> 01:27:46,694
Yep. Yeah.

1498
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:50,403
That's nice.

1499
01:27:56,402 --> 01:28:00,751
Yeah.

1500
01:28:00,752 --> 01:28:05,751
Yeah.

1501
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:27,391
I heard this week that are up now in 800 times,

1502
01:28:27,611 --> 01:28:31,070
and I'm sure it'll flow a little bit. Okay, I'm gonna do that in

1503
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,979
a minute. So, we're ready to quit. Let's- But I'm gonna add,

1504
01:28:34,181 --> 01:28:38,272
the candy house is based on the theme of opportunity.

1505
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,377
And it's not a suitable- So you gotta add,

1506
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:45,352
or you're a machine, you gotta offer a,

1507
01:28:45,563 --> 01:28:49,679
you know, a big bag. And, they have- and move them up here,

1508
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,730
y'all have to say hello to us. You know,

1509
01:28:51,731 --> 01:28:55,432
that's the front of the head, but I wonder how many times you think

1510
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:58,587
about any of the concerns. They're going pretty business.

1511
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:04,127
Yeah. Well, the question is do all these shops stay

1512
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:04,543
busy? Thank you.

1513
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:17,143
It's really expanding because the semi-con has been talking about you money here.

1514
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:21,816
Yeah. I think it's, that's a temporary thing.

1515
01:29:21,817 --> 01:29:26,545
I swear that I'm undivin' it.

1516
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:38,791
You. It's- Umm.

1517
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:42,198
For you,

1518
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:45,754
it was actually releasing such a process. Okay,

1519
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,943
that was an artist. is Well, good.

1520
01:29:49,002 --> 01:29:53,799
I didn't think it

1521
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:58,032
was. Hey, my question. You said it's a terrible thing when they look at

1522
01:29:58,033 --> 01:30:00,538
that and change up these birds. Yeah. Yeah.

1523
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:02,916
Yeah. Good bye.

1524
01:30:02,917 --> 01:30:06,483
Good bye. Well, it only changed over more than loads,

1525
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,509
so I mean, I can go into, uhm,

1526
01:30:08,519 --> 01:30:12,001
and- How about a kick

1527
01:30:18,991 --> 01:30:23,991

1528
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:30,864

If you have to conclude, I won't Thank

1538
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:27,331
you.

1539
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:29,730
I didn't even know that.

1540
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:32,290
Right, right over the corner from your house. I'm gonna try and stay there.

1541
01:31:32,384 --> 01:31:35,041
Stay in town now. It's you. Oh, that's just fine.

1542
01:31:35,061 --> 01:31:37,514
Bye. Thank you, George. I'm pretty good back here.

1543
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:39,667
I don't need to ask myself. Heh, heh,

1544
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:46,460
heh, heh, heh. That was it. It's

1545
01:31:46,461 --> 01:31:49,926
just having it spread out all the way except we just create some other

1546
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:55,161
issues. Yeah. You Umm,

1547
01:31:55,172 --> 01:31:57,246
that's the main issue in Sydney in Brooklyn,

1548
01:31:57,247 --> 01:31:59,421
right? Yes, in Sydney or not?

1549
01:31:59,422 --> 01:32:01,847
Bye. Yeah.

1550
01:32:01,848 --> 01:32:04,344
Yeah.

1551
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:06,840
Yeah.

1552
01:32:06,841 --> 01:32:09,007
And I'll see you in the next video. Yeah.

1553
01:32:09,008 --> 01:32:11,949
Yeah. Yeah.

1554
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:14,227
Yeah. I'm kidding, I'm pregnant.

1555
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,540
. . . .

1556
01:32:31,656 --> 01:32:35,654
I think I have three addresses. Oh,

1557
01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:40,265
the same one. Oh, Well,

1558
01:32:40,266 --> 01:32:43,722
we're around one leg, leg, and I'm going to put this on the floor.

1559
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:46,907
Yeah. That one's going to be fair enough that I'll do two of you.

1560
01:32:46,908 --> 01:32:46,944
See?

1561
01:32:56,011 --> 01:32:58,790
It's gonna be a little, I think, a lot of customers are going to

1562
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:02,071
get out of the house. You know, it's gonna get out of time.

1563
01:33:02,074 --> 01:33:04,247
Yeah, but it doesn't usually sit there. You do.

1564
01:33:04,248 --> 01:33:06,800
Uh, uhh. It's gonna be. It's gonna be.

1565
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:09,823
It's gonna it's gonna be. It's, uh,

1566
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,031
unless you put time, be in the labor center. Thank you.

1567
01:33:14,418 --> 01:33:17,342
It's gonna be. It's gonna It's gonna be.

1568
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:22,342
So

1569
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:26,374
here you go with the lens on this camera. What? Look,

1570
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,016
the sound is gonna last as loud as, you know, the rest of my-

1571
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:31,543
I'd say I've seen it, but I had much to say otherwise,

1572
01:33:31,544 --> 01:33:34,563
and it's an operation today. But by the sound,

1573
01:33:34,697 --> 01:33:37,344
they've already attended a 50-gling. Thank Yeah,

1574
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:41,018
it can work. I don't have facility either.

1575
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:44,541
But, uh,

1576
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:47,526
okay. Thank Uhh,

1577
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:50,550
data center skids, you know, it was 40 billion.

1578
01:33:51,155 --> 01:33:56,403
And the option bar just was 10. But

1579
01:33:56,404 --> 01:33:58,434
this will work at least a few.

1580
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:02,011
I'll show you it. Still work.

1581
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:04,058
Uhh, the skits are immigration,

1582
01:34:04,059 --> 01:34:07,081
so the skits, the skits don't see jobs,

1583
01:34:07,082 --> 01:34:09,263
obviously the skits don't look as good.

1584
01:34:09,325 --> 01:34:13,044
But you really suck. Now that we've got our talks of mothers and adults

1585
01:34:13,045 --> 01:34:15,266
and veterans. That's what we want.

1586
01:34:15,267 --> 01:34:18,000
We're still like 30% nearly 30%.

1587
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:23,567
It's all right.

1588
01:34:23,677 --> 01:34:26,788
Okay. I don't know what to say.

1589
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:29,855
All right. You don't like to go on the pumps and all that stuff.

1590
01:34:30,102 --> 01:34:32,423
You know, uh, electrical, you know,

1591
01:34:32,424 --> 01:34:34,661
if it's certified and it's just basic.

1592
01:34:34,662 --> 01:34:36,770
Isn't it? Stuff. Yay.

1593
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:42,044
So, if you burn on that and you burn on it,

1594
01:34:42,236 --> 01:34:45,384
that way I'm up. Oh. You know, your holes, uhm,

1595
01:34:45,395 --> 01:34:49,092
the cut, uhm, excuse me,

1596
01:34:49,093 --> 01:34:51,599
the punch. Thanks for watching. Really?

1597
01:34:53,373 --> 01:34:56,590
Hey, uhm, we need to go look at that.

1598
01:34:57,222 --> 01:34:59,646
So, go up to make the testing. And maybe,

1599
01:35:00,021 --> 01:35:00,804
later, right, it's, uhm, punch.

1600
01:35:07,896 --> 01:35:10,085
And due to the problem at the top,

1601
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:15,132
the touch-pot statements, at the end.

1602
01:35:15,133 --> 01:35:17,737
Amen. Where do you want home storage?

1603
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:21,183
And you say, oh, be basically a cat for the process and makes it

1604
01:35:21,184 --> 01:35:24,156
look like. Yeah. So then just chill.

1605
01:35:24,157 --> 01:35:26,729
Yeah. You even have punch mysterious,

1606
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,036
you punch husband. Ah,

1607
01:35:29,142 --> 01:35:31,774
I didn't see any much. Any heat, you can exchange that time with a

1608
01:35:31,775 --> 01:35:34,276
luscious. They got cut and drilled.

1609
01:35:34,442 --> 01:35:36,899
It might be a pharma process. They're jammed.

1610
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,909
It's, they need a site.

1611
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:42,639
Good. The whole management, the whole management is going to be there.

1612
01:35:43,008 --> 01:35:45,951
And then it breaks you. You take what you want.

1613
01:35:45,952 --> 01:35:47,975
So, yeah, they're terminal.

1614
01:35:47,976 --> 01:35:50,746
very well. It is all over here or should. They need to change it.

1615
01:35:51,676 --> 01:35:55,199
I guess people serve soon to have all of them that are starting to

1616
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,344
hear like, I don't- Punch it, man. Why don't you do the punch?

1617
01:35:58,576 --> 01:36:02,509
When you be into a drill, I'm uh,

1618
01:36:02,519 --> 01:36:04,959
I don't- know. It's not sitting in the air before- really touching.

1619
01:36:05,345 --> 01:36:08,051
So they get a drill as well. They good maintenance,

1620
01:36:08,245 --> 01:36:10,585
estimating labor maintenance and drill.

1621
01:36:10,586 --> 01:36:15,238
building. Same meal,

1622
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:18,568
but I'm going to have to talk and drill talk about maintenance and change

1623
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:20,791
rates. Thanks. Thank you.

1624
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:23,291
Well, you can change it to, like,

1625
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:25,704
it's all hard cutting. Yeah.

1626
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:28,303
So, once you and your learning is not hard cutting.

1627
01:36:28,304 --> 01:36:31,379
Later. Thank you. Okay.

1628
01:36:32,051 --> 01:36:36,871
Yes. And

1629
01:36:36,872 --> 01:36:38,892
you know, here's what we've got to know.

1630
01:36:40,084 --> 01:36:44,809
Right. I've been on show about

1631
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:44,880
this. .

1632
01:36:52,951 --> 01:36:56,629
So. So, uhh, uhh, hm. So, hm,

1633
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:59,180
hm. So.

1634
01:36:59,924 --> 01:37:04,573
so I'm also to begin also to maintenance.

1635
01:37:04,574 --> 01:37:07,138
Umm, where do you go? Yeah,

1636
01:37:07,139 --> 01:37:09,132
the link. Umm, sure. I'm going to leave the link. its main. Uhh, it's

1637
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:11,302
estimating labor maintenance labor.

1638
01:37:11,303 --> 01:37:16,087
Get a job out of the top of the labor maintenance

1639
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:21,416
and m- So here's my other places where it is going

1640
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:26,014
to be said. Clean goes- I'm going to ensure

1641
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:26,811
that I know this. And here's what's

1642
01:37:33,216 --> 01:37:36,050
all splicing. Probably not being used,

1643
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:39,981
but he came with a splice on his lip,

1644
01:37:39,982 --> 01:37:42,240
but it didn't, you know, on his You know what I Okay.

1645
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:51,662
So, I don't think it'd be well,

1646
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:55,410
but if it's placing things together, it would get something that's not correct,

1647
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,870
but it would have been a beautiful, old display. What this place? A little.

1648
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,885
But the front of the shot, it doesn't make sure the beam might have

1649
01:38:00,886 --> 01:38:04,303
to strike and put a spike to the moment. A spike wouldn't be well

1650
01:38:04,304 --> 01:38:06,841
enough if you don't have a ball. It's a lot of times I'm aiming

1651
01:38:06,842 --> 01:38:10,242
to be pulled into the field and it's escalating.

1652
01:38:10,243 --> 01:38:13,351
I'll show you where it is. See, see, you'll be better than before.

1653
01:38:13,352 --> 01:38:16,714
Don't come right back to labor maintenance,

1654
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:20,218
splice. Uhh,

1655
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:22,804
ehm, column splices. This is, So you can,

1656
01:38:22,805 --> 01:38:27,436
on a labor kit, you can say,

1657
01:38:27,512 --> 01:38:30,878
use this splice, this, I'm not used by the law,

1658
01:38:31,396 --> 01:38:34,805
and it's just a lot of average. So,

1659
01:38:34,806 --> 01:38:37,476
for your most people don't use it, yes. Thanks.

1660
01:38:37,477 --> 01:38:39,523
They don't put any material in themselves,

1661
01:38:39,524 --> 01:38:42,232
and they don't put labor to it. And the labor gets,

1662
01:38:42,233 --> 01:38:44,766
and most people don't use this, but, you know,

1663
01:38:44,922 --> 01:38:49,557
there it is. It

1664
01:38:49,558 --> 01:38:51,777
just doesn't give you a breakdown of what it is.

1665
01:38:51,778 --> 01:38:54,163
It's that kind of almost that hole. 3 4 4 3 It's that,

1666
01:38:54,272 --> 01:38:57,512
it's that actually putting it on there or what it is.

1667
01:38:57,513 --> 01:38:59,739
It's just doesn't give you a breakdown. So,

1668
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,033
let's get cleaned up on these events. So,

1669
01:39:02,502 --> 01:39:03,420
that's it. .

1670
01:39:17,676 --> 01:39:20,171
I think we have clung med,

1671
01:39:20,172 --> 01:39:28,051
med, med. Alright. Okay. So

1672
01:39:28,052 --> 01:39:30,920
maybe we'll lay them down, then get us that hours for peace,

1673
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:33,751
though. It's so,

1674
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:37,744
. But I'm really trying to help you with people too much anyway,

1675
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:40,554
but, erm, it's used too much,

1676
01:39:40,555 --> 01:39:42,692
but, I want to be with that.

1677
01:39:44,259 --> 01:39:47,911
I say I'm keeping my mother just because I know that we are blind

1678
01:39:47,912 --> 01:39:53,238
when somebody's ending your- I think we should have

1679
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:57,876
you re-

1680
01:39:57,877 --> 01:40:00,105
in the corner of the right,

1681
01:40:00,106 --> 01:40:03,229
but it's uhm, so you can probably get back in to leave the other

1682
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:08,006
ones now and- I

1683
01:40:08,007 --> 01:40:12,615
don't- I don't know what this is

1684
01:40:12,616 --> 01:40:15,129
today. I don't think again. I don't think- I'm going down four to five

1685
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:17,527
in the morning is gonna start thinking about my Deerell March.

1686
01:40:17,977 --> 01:40:21,991
You know that's- And it's so,

1687
01:40:21,992 --> 01:40:24,363
So, to be fair.

1688
01:40:24,364 --> 01:40:24,645
All right.

1689
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,926
Perfect.

1690
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:31,700
Okay.

1691
01:40:35,845 --> 01:40:41,767
Okay. I don't

1692
01:40:41,768 --> 01:40:46,719
know if it's used

1693
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,164
somewhere by the same. Thank you. Umm, ehm,

1694
01:40:49,369 --> 01:40:51,755
ehm, ehm,

1695
01:40:51,811 --> 01:40:56,746
ehm, It's

1696
01:40:56,747 --> 01:40:59,359
perseb Aurited, it is perseb Aurited,

1697
01:40:59,663 --> 01:41:04,231
crushed by forty two 20- bars.

1698
01:41:04,232 --> 01:41:09,231
Yeah,

1699
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:17,315
I I'm trying to get the other facilities to say that.

1700
01:41:17,316 --> 01:41:19,784
The stuff is kind of unfair to the people at the most.

1701
01:41:19,984 --> 01:41:21,068
And yeah, look at that.

1702
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:32,023
I think there is. Uh,

1703
01:41:32,034 --> 01:41:35,841
yeah, that is going to camber. Do you want that in camber and press

1704
01:41:35,842 --> 01:41:38,256
right here against,

1705
01:41:38,257 --> 01:41:40,952
It's good.

1706
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:44,952
Camber's probably the thing that is to keep their honesty and camber tight together.

1707
01:41:44,953 --> 01:41:47,543
It'll be equals. We'll see you in a minute. Okay.

1708
01:41:47,544 --> 01:41:49,773
Just shy of the pencil. You may never use it.

1709
01:41:50,458 --> 01:41:52,800
So, because they look like just the client.

1710
01:41:52,801 --> 01:41:55,403
Time to pop in third bit. You know, actually,

1711
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:59,586
we had just a little bit better because they used to be like the

1712
01:41:59,587 --> 01:42:04,346
energy from eight men. and most of our camera deals are working on more

1713
01:42:04,347 --> 01:42:08,373
than, you know, three hours. So if it's anything outside,

1714
01:42:08,374 --> 01:42:11,010
we have these in my machine. So I had some,

1715
01:42:11,011 --> 01:42:13,886
I mean, it would be over. It's a murky camera,

1716
01:42:13,893 --> 01:42:17,575
isn't it? Yep. Um, so the two hours is about to facilitate the monitor.

1717
01:42:17,817 --> 01:42:20,319
and then we'll see a few hours you want to sit. Yeah,

1718
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:25,160
I'm about to go. It's not a statement. Twenty-five,

1719
01:42:25,161 --> 01:42:27,163
right, and then three years. We'll in the next one. Okay, good job.

1720
01:42:27,164 --> 01:42:30,096
Somebody else. I can't remember. You know, they're collecting dust and stuff.

1721
01:42:30,378 --> 01:42:32,575
I can't remember. It's a team.

1722
01:42:32,576 --> 01:42:34,632
We're about to be in flight. But,

1723
01:42:34,633 --> 01:42:37,989
uh, I'm at 48.

1724
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:40,891
I have a stress break. Umm.

1725
01:42:40,902 --> 01:42:45,578
you Yeah,

1726
01:42:45,579 --> 01:42:51,706
this one

1727
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:56,869
would probably be more on their fit.

1728
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:01,895
Just because they're- I don't know if they're willing to be fit,

1729
01:43:01,896 --> 01:43:03,971
I don't know if they're fit,

1730
01:43:03,972 --> 01:43:07,955
Okay. We'll see I don't know.

1731
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:12,030
I don't know. I don't know. Here's what I've been. It's on the circuit

1732
01:43:12,031 --> 01:43:15,274
and it's the key. Yeah, bending is definitely- It's me,

1733
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:18,151
you know, and- sometimes I can be an argument, but there's been an evolving

1734
01:43:18,152 --> 01:43:19,622
is the same thing, but- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1735
01:43:19,623 --> 01:43:22,752
no, no, no, no, you

1736
01:43:30,931 --> 01:43:33,029
Well, we thought of good.

1737
01:43:33,759 --> 01:43:36,271
We put the first three time when we can, when we can, when This

1738
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,971
really is an inherent workplace.

1739
01:43:38,972 --> 01:43:42,756
Uh, possibly generally, but after it's been the process.

1740
01:43:43,545 --> 01:43:46,936
And a lot of times, we need to be.

1741
01:43:46,937 --> 01:43:55,051
. . .

1742
01:43:55,052 --> 01:43:57,994
Yeah, I mean, we can keep it that way.

1743
01:43:57,995 --> 01:44:00,475
It's s for anyways.

1744
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:03,091
Anyways, I'm,

1745
01:44:03,092 --> 01:44:07,686
Yeah, that's just gonna be another area where we

1746
01:44:07,687 --> 01:44:10,635
release it for handling cut fit well.

1747
01:44:10,636 --> 01:44:12,665
Go on. vern So,

1748
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:17,417
you still have visibility to the time regardless of how you can make it.

1749
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,842
Yeah. You know, it's not, it's not. Yeah.

1750
01:44:19,843 --> 01:44:21,988
So, yeah, instead,

1751
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:26,361
you're running for a day to be.

1752
01:44:26,482 --> 01:44:30,142
You know, it's not.

1753
01:44:30,143 --> 01:44:33,070
Now, that was sort of a separate category, but it was to be in

1754
01:44:33,071 --> 01:44:35,251
the total one out. Oh.

1755
01:44:35,252 --> 01:44:39,793
Almost, and then from there, that's the fabrication

1756
01:44:39,794 --> 01:44:42,784
shop project miniatures expression.

1757
01:44:42,785 --> 01:44:47,225
Thanks watching! . . I'm going to write that guys to put this toy's

1758
01:44:47,226 --> 01:44:50,392
handling, because we took the time to put it here,

1759
01:44:50,393 --> 01:44:54,503
or ehm. You this is going to go to fit for tracking purposes,

1760
01:44:54,504 --> 01:44:57,785
and then you'll be with the operator, and then you'll be able to for

1761
01:44:57,789 --> 01:45:01,343
others to break the display. Later. This is your boat making your floorovers to

1762
01:45:01,344 --> 01:45:04,564
the end. And then I've been getting time tracking,

1763
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:07,400
you know, add gnolls, break the rest of the-

1764
01:45:15,456 --> 01:45:17,784
So, gambling, uh,

1765
01:45:17,795 --> 01:45:21,742
it will have a burden. I can learn even more about this type of

1766
01:45:21,743 --> 01:45:24,003
location. Ehm, I can learn even more about gambling, too.

1767
01:45:24,191 --> 01:45:28,394
Okay, that's really good for gambling. Thank you for,

1768
01:45:28,395 --> 01:45:30,570
there's a lot of things to talk about.

1769
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:32,621
It's right up here. Yeah. That's what, that's what I said.

1770
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:35,104
I think that we're going to be achieving care, kind of, like,

1771
01:45:35,115 --> 01:45:37,869
all processes. Holes and cows,

1772
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:40,946
and I'm going to get a code meeting with this. is Okay.

1773
01:45:40,947 --> 01:45:44,719
Yeah. I hate it fast.

1774
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,191
We used to have a category fast and everybody put everything.

1775
01:45:47,192 --> 01:45:49,274
you Well, yeah, actually, they did, yeah.

1776
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:52,314
And it was, yeah, then we went to fit up and,

1777
01:45:52,315 --> 01:45:54,356
well, that became confusing.

1778
01:45:54,357 --> 01:45:58,253
Thank you very much. It,

1779
01:45:58,254 --> 01:46:02,806
yeah, it depends on how you're going to shop. If you want to know.

1780
01:46:02,807 --> 01:46:06,214
Oh. Our fillers can dwell on our owners to fit it.

1781
01:46:07,266 --> 01:46:07,600
So. No.

1782
01:46:11,731 --> 01:46:13,833
As we moved away from the,

1783
01:46:15,472 --> 01:46:18,269
I have seen a lot of other figures.

1784
01:46:19,033 --> 01:46:21,830
I love that. You mmm, that was only kind of there,

1785
01:46:22,573 --> 01:46:26,661
right? I knew something freaked out for a deep minute.

1786
01:46:27,116 --> 01:46:30,071
You know what that is? I don't it.

1787
01:46:30,072 --> 01:46:31,665
This one I don't understand. I don't know how to do it in San

1788
01:46:31,666 --> 01:46:34,061
I've never done all that in this three-game opens.

1789
01:46:34,793 --> 01:46:35,856
Yeah, that was it.

1790
01:46:40,548 --> 01:46:41,945
That's not something that we're in traveling this election. Oh, that's, I mean, it

1791
01:46:42,115 --> 01:46:48,156
is. I love the food. I mean,

1792
01:46:48,157 --> 01:46:50,246
that's, that's just a weird one though. I don't think that's, it's all in

1793
01:46:50,247 --> 01:46:53,551
the mood. You it doesn't even make up for the,

1794
01:46:53,702 --> 01:46:58,498
for a way to give it the hospital. It's what it is.

1795
01:46:59,374 --> 01:47:02,452
Okay. It's, It is a cabin for a gal who doesn't cost.

1796
01:47:03,887 --> 01:47:06,017
And they, and this will be, like, uhm, uhm,

1797
01:47:06,027 --> 01:47:07,968
and be- Thanks watching!

1798
01:47:20,554 --> 01:47:22,573
So, that makes sense to me. And then they're just, so, move, we would

1799
01:47:22,879 --> 01:47:28,009
switch. with. You know, all of you guys run

1800
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:30,377
a system that has galvanizing and pain.

1801
01:47:30,378 --> 01:47:33,590
Thank It's the job this year.

1802
01:47:33,775 --> 01:47:37,631
Me. I mean, a lot of that's great environments.

1803
01:47:37,955 --> 01:47:40,037
Great environments. Yeah.

1804
01:47:39,511 --> 01:47:42,952
Yeah. A lot. Heavy corrosion areas.

1805
01:47:43,084 --> 01:47:45,447
Things are just down there. They're just bad at the time. They're bad.

1806
01:47:45,494 --> 01:47:48,211
I'm not bad not bad at the time.

1807
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,482
Yeah, I didn't know it. We made light calls,

1808
01:47:50,483 --> 01:47:52,609
same light call, we sent the same call.

1809
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:56,251
Sometimes I was sent in a coastal city and then so the one guy,

1810
01:47:56,252 --> 01:47:59,427
I know how to analyze it,

1811
01:48:00,837 --> 01:48:03,006
that pain over it. Okay. Cause if someone looked pretty, they don't want that

1812
01:48:03,007 --> 01:48:09,044
galvanized. Yeah. Good. I

1813
01:48:09,045 --> 01:48:12,396
think everything else is good if people like it and others.

1814
01:48:12,397 --> 01:48:14,555
. . . And,

1815
01:48:14,556 --> 01:48:16,752
uhm,

1816
01:48:16,805 --> 01:48:20,425
shimmy. Bye!

1817
01:48:20,426 --> 01:48:25,425
.

1818
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:31,340
So

1819
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:41,388
what's going to happen when we change all these categories and we try to

1820
01:48:41,389 --> 01:48:44,496
run whole estimates through the area of the donut.

1821
01:48:44,497 --> 01:48:48,671
That two or don't have these categories. It's really important of this.

1822
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:51,416
So if we look at all this, then we're going to spell out the

1823
01:48:51,417 --> 01:48:53,608
change. Thank you very So, uhm,

1824
01:48:53,618 --> 01:48:56,748
second I effect the labor because it will affect the buckets and holes in

1825
01:48:56,749 --> 01:49:00,128
the two yap. We're not going to explain that in a minute anyways.

1826
01:49:00,129 --> 01:49:02,138
Thanks. We're not changing labor.

1827
01:49:02,139 --> 01:49:05,657
I'm curious. We're not changing labor at how we're just redirecting more of that

1828
01:49:05,658 --> 01:49:07,664
labor. Yeah. All right. Thank you. It's a great day.

1829
01:49:08,203 --> 01:49:10,320
Thank you. It's still going to be there. Yeah. you

1830
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:18,878
Yeah, I hear qrom does, what,

1831
01:49:18,879 --> 01:49:22,443
four estimates a week. Yeah.

1832
01:49:22,444 --> 01:49:25,411
It's about the number, the other guy. Bye.

1833
01:49:25,412 --> 01:49:27,552
Okay, good. Okay, have a voice.

1834
01:49:27,553 --> 01:49:30,162
Let's see how we can do that. Okay, have a good day.

1835
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:32,256
Cheers. Thank you.

1836
01:49:32,257 --> 01:49:35,717
Alright. Mmm.

1837
01:49:37,057 --> 01:49:40,380
Nice. I love the rest of it. I think we can do it this

1838
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:43,572
probably what the, uh,

1839
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,964
how much of a piece of board will do. Yeah,

1840
01:49:45,965 --> 01:49:49,411
and then, you know, it's probably roll. Yeah. Yeah.

1841
01:49:48,975 --> 01:49:51,245
Yeah, I'm not sure,

1842
01:49:51,372 --> 01:49:54,177
you know. It may be that the labor operation is a point to one,

1843
01:49:54,178 --> 01:49:56,454
and then, that's what the problem only is in the label.

1844
01:49:56,455 --> 01:50:00,024
We'll more. You know, we're not seeing the 15 or 16,

1845
01:50:00,025 --> 01:50:04,680
so one, one, one. Uh. This one's fine.

1846
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:07,718
All right. It's fine. It's ok.

1847
01:50:07,719 --> 01:50:12,303
It's alright. And when you tell

1848
01:50:12,304 --> 01:50:14,436
it, I think you can fit it, while you do the video.

1849
01:50:14,437 --> 01:50:16,801
And paint. And that's,

1850
01:50:17,142 --> 01:50:19,204
that's probably all the wood,

1851
01:50:19,205 --> 01:50:22,411
uhh, arts and gear more.

1852
01:50:22,412 --> 01:50:24,661
Yeah, that could be something important to you. What,

1853
01:50:24,662 --> 01:50:27,827
that would be perfect. Uhh, yeah, I would say so. Okay.

1854
01:50:27,828 --> 01:50:30,320
instrumental.

1855
01:50:30,321 --> 01:50:31,822
I going to you for We'll see you if we're talking in the house

1856
01:50:31,828 --> 01:50:35,743
where he isn't about to see someone talk to him or talk to him.

1857
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:38,431
I, I was just, I was just kind of.

1858
01:50:38,432 --> 01:50:41,043
He, he got him and then he would burn his own plate.

1859
01:50:41,721 --> 01:50:43,880
And that was gonna be my plug-in' down. So, okay,

1860
01:50:43,881 --> 01:50:46,411
I'll make sure I see it. Okay.

1861
01:50:46,412 --> 01:50:47,232
Are you here?

1862
01:50:54,451 --> 01:51:00,103
Let's take a

1863
01:51:00,104 --> 01:51:02,975
look at this. That's gonna get money real good.

1864
01:51:02,976 --> 01:51:05,527
really. Yes, for a reason, I see seven torch,

1865
01:51:05,528 --> 01:51:09,707
but that's cut time to do it into the detailed environment,

1866
01:51:10,126 --> 01:51:14,708
and then it's up to the email. No. The main goal is hope that,

1867
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:19,139
uh, that all of that's gonna be under third.

1868
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:21,659
You gotta find. So,

1869
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:25,175
here. Okay. So,

1870
01:51:25,176 --> 01:51:27,391
uh, let's see which one is you.

1871
01:51:27,392 --> 01:51:30,219
. . If it's usually good, it's like, it's a mission first.

1872
01:51:32,571 --> 01:51:40,049
And again, it's operating. Alright. Yep.

1873
01:51:40,789 --> 01:51:42,852
And in operations, I have a lot of them.

1874
01:51:43,838 --> 01:51:47,959
And very good. Good. I'm a there. So it's usually a manual part of

1875
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:52,263
the grade. What if that's what you're doing?

1876
01:51:52,264 --> 01:51:56,283
I'm, Umm,

1877
01:51:56,284 --> 01:51:59,418
get it to, let's say, get a layer of heads and see what you're

1878
01:51:59,419 --> 01:52:01,444
doing. Thank you. Play, labor,

1879
01:52:01,453 --> 01:52:03,863
codes are used and I'm gonna bet you, see if you'll land here.

1880
01:52:03,882 --> 01:52:04,155
No.

1881
01:52:09,451 --> 01:52:13,359
Like,

1882
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,459
or write bits, and then, like, where can it happen?

1883
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:19,851
That's it. You I always forget that this way,

1884
01:52:19,852 --> 01:52:22,189
and I just see you do this every time.

1885
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:26,827
Yeah. Until the end of the- I'm frightened.

1886
01:52:32,072 --> 01:52:36,824
Okay, just go to the phone. We'll just have an hover over

1887
01:52:36,825 --> 01:52:39,335
that, and then I'll show you the,

1888
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:41,681
uhm, the formula. If thickness is a grip.

1889
01:52:41,682 --> 01:52:43,825
. . Uh,

1890
01:52:43,835 --> 01:52:45,979
burn manual, son of a coach,

1891
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,194
and the, and applying the shear easily exact so.

1892
01:52:49,195 --> 01:52:53,075
That's it. So if we report it,

1893
01:52:53,076 --> 01:52:57,580
we report the whole thing. Okay.

1894
01:52:57,581 --> 01:53:00,230
We'll get back So I guess the question is, do you want to use

1895
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:04,270
a different burner rate for the codes?

1896
01:53:05,051 --> 01:53:07,252
And, Umm,

1897
01:53:07,262 --> 01:53:10,477
do that. I would definitely say so,

1898
01:53:10,478 --> 01:53:13,580
considering the hyperphenoming.

1899
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:18,346
You are going to step operation to be going to run a significantly

1900
01:53:18,347 --> 01:53:21,876
faster burn rate than an operator out here with a,

1901
01:53:21,877 --> 01:53:24,137
in-torch, so. Yeah. Yeah,

1902
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:26,584
that's good. Alright, okay.

1903
01:53:27,212 --> 01:53:29,911
So let's get a look at the burn pattern. Here go.

1904
01:53:29,912 --> 01:53:32,075
This is the main rate. It's a burning rate. Thank you very much.

1905
01:53:37,951 --> 01:53:42,387
So, problem we're gonna have,

1906
01:53:42,388 --> 01:53:45,112
so that's what the plate machine is using.

1907
01:53:45,633 --> 01:53:49,382
Yeah. . . Well, that's what the point machine is using right now.

1908
01:53:49,383 --> 01:53:53,743
Uhm, which, what it says is that the processor,

1909
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:56,874
uhm. It's like it is 6-3,

1910
01:53:56,875 --> 01:53:59,069
so I'm gonna try and hit 6-3,

1911
01:53:59,070 --> 01:54:02,071
and then I'm gonna result like that. So I'm gonna turn it off.

1912
01:54:02,072 --> 01:54:04,513
And that's one thing we can,

1913
01:54:04,514 --> 01:54:09,076
uh, uhm, put it down in this for a few

1914
01:54:09,077 --> 01:54:12,307
years. Good. I, you know,

1915
01:54:12,308 --> 01:54:14,625
I don't know what you want to do here if you want to.

1916
01:54:15,151 --> 01:54:18,151
We could either change the plate to a different earth.

1917
01:54:18,152 --> 01:54:21,254
Or we can change the, uhh,

1918
01:54:21,264 --> 01:54:23,659
kind of be in a different part of that. Anything,

1919
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:26,388
anything, you know, the biggest, the same. Thank much. I don't know,

1920
01:54:26,389 --> 01:54:30,541
all the magic is going to be faster than this. Umm,

1921
01:54:30,552 --> 01:54:35,270
get us some of that. Go I'm going

1922
01:54:35,271 --> 01:54:38,216
to be at best probably more realistic 3-plate machine.

1923
01:54:39,917 --> 01:54:42,276
And get an automatic. I'm having this.

1924
01:54:42,277 --> 01:54:44,767
It's like, it's like,

1925
01:54:45,352 --> 01:54:47,891
super fast. I love you now.

1926
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:51,324
That might be actual. Show. Uh,

1927
01:54:51,334 --> 01:54:53,510
I have to turn it back. Yeah, it might be,

1928
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:55,935
but it doesn't, it can't probably move into the hip before,

1929
01:54:55,936 --> 01:54:58,351
before the arch starts, right? It doesn't.

1930
01:54:58,352 --> 01:55:00,887
So, is there this would be,

1931
01:55:00,888 --> 01:55:05,887
2.

1932
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,100
You

1933
01:55:14,551 --> 01:55:19,401
So

1934
01:55:19,402 --> 01:55:23,431
there's a boxy. Yeah. See ya.

1935
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:28,431
Listen,

1936
01:55:30,653 --> 01:55:33,813
we're finally ready. Right. Share some videos that we've been looking for.

1937
01:55:34,596 --> 01:55:37,681
I mean, we'll be able to adjust.

1938
01:55:38,943 --> 01:55:42,459
Okay. Okay. I mean, I'm assuming that you're interested in it.

1939
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:47,034
So I'm talking and staying engaged. And I'm not just getting in the middle

1940
01:55:47,035 --> 01:55:50,610
of the picture. I'm not in the middle of the picture.

1941
01:55:52,173 --> 01:55:55,531
I'm just going to get in the middle.

1942
01:55:55,532 --> 01:55:57,727
. Well, it's the 18 year.

1943
01:55:58,555 --> 01:56:01,481
This is a machine without the boiler. That's good.

1944
01:56:01,482 --> 01:56:03,511
Yeah. Yeah. Coria.

1945
01:56:03,512 --> 01:56:07,333
Mhm. Yeah, interested to create the E home.

1946
01:56:07,334 --> 01:56:09,818
I'm amazing at 75 and then you know what,

1947
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:13,492
working at. It's. It's just burning and it's.

1948
01:56:14,542 --> 01:56:19,104
I'm worried that I'm fast because I don't think it's the accounting strategy like

1949
01:56:19,105 --> 01:56:23,657
he makes. . It's not, you know, the machine may actually burn that

1950
01:56:23,658 --> 01:56:27,368
fast, but it's not time to move the head over here.

1951
01:56:27,369 --> 01:56:29,664
you You're here, you're here. Yeah. Well,

1952
01:56:29,665 --> 01:56:31,720
I think there's, I mean,

1953
01:56:31,721 --> 01:56:35,322
the programs that calculate this take a lot of this.

1954
01:56:35,323 --> 01:56:35,556
Thank very much.

1955
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:43,591
When you pick these test speeds, like, when you make a turn. Bye.

1956
01:56:43,592 --> 01:56:47,943
Depending on how you program, it slows the speed down as you cut the

1957
01:56:47,944 --> 01:56:51,571
arc, and it can cut the volume. Um. Thank much for watching.

1958
01:56:51,572 --> 01:56:55,000
Piers times are depending on what you're piercing.

1959
01:56:56,089 --> 01:56:59,551
You know, those drive a lot of, uhh.

1960
01:56:59,552 --> 01:57:04,173
. A lot of this. What the guy uses for consumables,

1961
01:57:04,174 --> 01:57:07,420
nutters, or vots. And see what I've heard.

1962
01:57:07,421 --> 01:57:10,110
You know, 10 inches per minute for quarter H.A.K.

1963
01:57:11,005 --> 01:57:13,509
That's 550 feet per hour.

1964
01:57:14,148 --> 01:57:18,376
And I'll find the most. . . . because people are running at,

1965
01:57:18,929 --> 01:57:21,921
they're good to see, but I have to go. I'ma have to sound better

1966
01:57:21,922 --> 01:57:24,436
music. Peace for all of us. Like that,

1967
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:27,163
yeah. It's, uh, not gonna eat that.

1968
01:57:27,761 --> 01:57:30,440
Look and see what the, what the other machines were for,

1969
01:57:30,441 --> 01:57:32,986
for the reach. Thank you so What's the same,

1970
01:57:32,987 --> 01:57:35,257
uh, it's 5.5.

1971
01:57:35,258 --> 01:57:37,509
What's the same, uh, what do you mean I don't know?

1972
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:39,571
Sure. Sorry.

1973
01:57:39,572 --> 01:57:42,327
Umm, but it looks like this or something.

1974
01:57:42,328 --> 01:57:45,158
Oh, we're putting in the base parts on it.

1975
01:57:45,159 --> 01:57:48,612
Umm, base parts. Umm. you There's plates,

1976
01:57:48,613 --> 01:57:50,796
cap plates, stippin'overs,

1977
01:57:50,797 --> 01:57:52,974
uhh, regressive plates.

1978
01:57:53,477 --> 01:57:55,591
So it looks as small as it's in the back. Yeah. Yeah.

1979
01:57:55,592 --> 01:57:58,368
I think it's the last part. I don't know if this is anything over

1980
01:57:58,369 --> 01:58:01,009
two-inch. We got it in that stuff. It's the only thing that's got this.

1981
01:58:01,582 --> 01:58:03,631
Your boss means it's a lot of nuts.

1982
01:58:03,632 --> 01:58:07,749
I don't know. I don't care if I follow those out because they were

1983
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:11,611
too weak. We're learning the 96 by 240 in that table.

1984
01:58:11,612 --> 01:58:14,562
Yeah. Meals and plates from a 40 foot,

1985
01:58:14,769 --> 01:58:18,105
and they could purchase some with a belt or anything like that.

1986
01:58:18,106 --> 01:58:20,972
Yeah. So. I'm coming. It was,

1987
01:58:20,973 --> 01:58:25,777
uh, aint trying to find an intimate order plate at

1988
01:58:25,778 --> 01:58:27,577
40 foot, but should have a- You

1989
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:37,759
. ehm, you know, we merge our root of the top,

1990
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,792
and they are just, we might stop.

1991
01:58:40,621 --> 01:58:43,325
Mhm. They don't explain this to you in a second.

1992
01:58:43,326 --> 01:58:46,043
Thank you very Someone I'm gonna have to remember something and see if it

1993
01:58:46,053 --> 01:58:48,078
has to put pages for that.

1994
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:52,095
Well, that's, that's probably still so longer than what you're really- I don't know,

1995
01:58:52,096 --> 01:58:54,846
but right now, maybe a little bit is a lot easier to use over

1996
01:58:54,847 --> 01:58:56,973
this, like, super short. So,

1997
01:58:56,974 --> 01:58:59,036
uh, at least that's why I'm not what you're saying.

1998
01:58:59,037 --> 01:59:01,094
Yeah. Yeah. And we can change our list,

1999
01:59:01,095 --> 01:59:03,903
too, right? You know, we can change our list rates.

2000
01:59:04,598 --> 01:59:07,908
We can make it match. I don't know if you can give you- I'm

2001
01:59:07,909 --> 01:59:09,918
not really sure where you want it to be done here,

2002
01:59:09,919 --> 01:59:13,756
but I don't know if you want to like and use the purpose and

2003
01:59:13,767 --> 01:59:18,047
say, let me get it. Well, happy- It's from being one quarter,

2004
01:59:18,048 --> 01:59:21,067
it's from being one eighth, from being the manager. I don't know if that's

2005
01:59:21,068 --> 01:59:23,203
what you want to do or, yeah.

2006
01:59:23,204 --> 01:59:25,632
Now- Well done. I mean, this week he gave me.

2007
01:59:25,633 --> 01:59:29,042
We came back a little after we started working, and I couldn't even walk.

2008
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:31,471
We got all of this. I had to travel. I to travel.

2009
01:59:31,472 --> 01:59:33,838
I had to travel. Yeah, and here we have it.

2010
01:59:33,839 --> 01:59:36,330
What do you want to eat, or change your own savour?

2011
01:59:36,433 --> 01:59:39,361
But I don't want you to savour it properly.

2012
01:59:39,362 --> 01:59:43,517
Oh, my God. I think Sarah has,

2013
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:46,204
at least closer to men and men,

2014
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:49,658
really slow. Oh. They are automatically this.

2015
01:59:50,199 --> 01:59:53,693
That's the promise. That's one of the key brides that we can work on

2016
01:59:53,694 --> 01:59:55,831
today. So, ehm.

2017
01:59:55,832 --> 01:59:57,855
I'm going to send them back to see if you can evolve.

2018
01:59:58,232 --> 02:00:00,565
Yeah, and get us at least a lot closer than that.

2019
02:00:00,566 --> 02:00:03,748
Yeah. They won't really, uh, they won't really blame you.

2020
02:00:03,749 --> 02:00:03,871
No.

2021
02:00:10,732 --> 02:00:14,107
Okay, Okay, cool. We'll read from the manual to,

2022
02:00:14,108 --> 02:00:18,773
uhh, yeah, the burn. And we'll see

2023
02:00:18,774 --> 02:00:23,393
you two more that we keep up with them.

2024
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:26,187
Burn, burn, keep it all up right there.

2025
02:00:26,456 --> 02:00:28,651
So you got the manual cover. Perfect. Okay, bye.

2026
02:00:28,449 --> 02:00:28,651
Bye.

2027
02:00:32,947 --> 02:00:34,960
Yeah. Unless I send it out. Yeah.

2028
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:39,846
She's there the other day. I let the top burn. Thanks having me. We'll

2029
02:00:39,847 --> 02:00:41,989
take the manual and we'll form that to where we want to go in

2030
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:44,532
with more of your hand, folks. Bye.

2031
02:00:44,533 --> 02:00:53,745
You So

2032
02:00:53,746 --> 02:00:57,273
that I would have, like, in case I named all that Spanish or something,

2033
02:00:57,274 --> 02:01:00,691
and even though the recreation I might change it as well.

2034
02:01:00,692 --> 02:01:02,950
Because that's what shouldn't have done to formulas.

2035
02:01:03,918 --> 02:01:07,904
And, uh, that, that way you can know what these rights are,

2036
02:01:08,084 --> 02:01:09,966
damn great. Alright. We're gonna have a look at this and,

2037
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:20,702
Where do you change the rating? That's all that's gonna be said in the

2038
02:01:20,703 --> 02:01:21,820
name of God. Yeah. Good.

2039
02:01:42,631 --> 02:01:44,666
Alright,

2040
02:01:44,667 --> 02:01:47,992
so we'll have to do that helping. We gotta get back into the labor

2041
02:01:47,993 --> 02:01:50,981
case. We have to be right around here. Who's gonna be- I'm gonna do

2042
02:01:50,982 --> 02:01:55,482
the labor case. Change that formula for more,

2043
02:01:55,483 --> 02:01:58,620
umm, the cadm. So supporting that.

2044
02:01:58,621 --> 02:02:02,652
Yeah. That's similar rate rather than linear rate.

2045
02:02:05,222 --> 02:02:07,651
And so uncheck.

2046
02:02:07,652 --> 02:02:11,002
I'm gonna leave it, leave it. See if there's one below it.

2047
02:02:12,151 --> 02:02:15,636
Just run around and go ahead and hit one. Then we'll see if it's,

2048
02:02:15,183 --> 02:02:17,774
It's the same uh,

2049
02:02:17,785 --> 02:02:19,830
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

2050
02:02:19,983 --> 02:02:22,560
ehm. If you want to push more baby,

2051
02:02:22,905 --> 02:02:26,535
part of the day. You know,

2052
02:02:26,536 --> 02:02:29,469
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm.

2053
02:02:31,117 --> 02:02:35,609
This one looks like a cat. Yes. Yeah,

2054
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:39,126
so I wanted to create one for Barnes and,

2055
02:02:39,127 --> 02:02:41,029
uh, which is not a deal. See you later. I'm gonna go to the

2056
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:45,527
dropout of the top. I'm gonna create this.

2057
02:02:46,784 --> 02:02:49,993
And I'm gonna find that for more of a little. I have made one

2058
02:02:49,994 --> 02:02:52,710
with five of it and this changed their heads.

2059
02:02:54,676 --> 02:02:56,791
See, I have made one with the bottom. Oh.

2060
02:02:56,792 --> 02:03:01,459
And then in the added operation formulas,

2061
02:03:01,466 --> 02:03:06,163
what you want to do. There. And just so much to

2062
02:03:06,289 --> 02:03:09,959
burn man. Get rid of that.

2063
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:12,811
Can you hear me burn man? Bye bye.

2064
02:03:12,812 --> 02:03:15,466
I can't get rid of that whole thing there.

2065
02:03:19,784 --> 02:03:22,603
Yep, and then- Got operations down here.

2066
02:03:23,033 --> 02:03:27,029
Got the drop down. There you go.

2067
02:03:27,117 --> 02:03:32,395
Thank you. Get your tables in that operation.

2068
02:03:33,522 --> 02:03:36,127
Every good. So now we've got to be in there. So get okay.

2069
02:03:36,412 --> 02:03:39,596
While we're- I can hear it. Well that makes up that if you have

2070
02:03:39,597 --> 02:03:42,262
house-ended. Umm,

2071
02:03:42,273 --> 02:03:45,208
yeah. Yeah, because it's looking at- Yeah,

2072
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:49,028
if we can share, share, they stop and pass it in the everyday room,

2073
02:03:49,029 --> 02:03:52,051
then as well as you're ready. So it's my bypass all the way from

2074
02:03:52,052 --> 02:03:54,104
you straight to the bar. Don't you? So, okay.

2075
02:03:54,178 --> 02:03:57,207
So it doesn't expect an argument after it else.

2076
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:59,744
No. We put it at it,

2077
02:03:59,745 --> 02:04:03,114
yes. thank you. After the border was ended.

2078
02:04:03,903 --> 02:04:08,296
So, this one, this one, the other statements don't have an else and if

2079
02:04:08,499 --> 02:04:10,829
at the end. Bye. Bye, Tim.

2080
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:13,569
It's, it's, it's gonna be good. Okay.

2081
02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:15,968
Umm, while we're here,

2082
02:04:15,969 --> 02:04:18,972
see the length. Thanks. This is what I was going to do about that

2083
02:04:19,128 --> 02:04:23,214
was roll and how it works in my vehicle.

2084
02:04:23,215 --> 02:04:26,621
The, the, the length formula- basically I said it's really,

2085
02:04:26,622 --> 02:04:28,775
it's really, it's really,

2086
02:04:28,776 --> 02:04:31,611
um, so you like that,

2087
02:04:31,612 --> 02:04:35,237
so you know. Umm,

2088
02:04:35,247 --> 02:04:37,481
yeah, you might need no chain cut or something,

2089
02:04:37,482 --> 02:04:39,907
you know, it's not necessarily going to be that same thing,

2090
02:04:39,908 --> 02:04:43,911
but, well I'll take the- do yourself a quick seat right there and then

2091
02:04:43,912 --> 02:04:47,329
just be time to do it. Put the p-ball as always,

2092
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:50,029
cut the program. Do-do that to p- Yeah,

2093
02:04:50,030 --> 02:04:52,948
now I'm going to talk to you.

2094
02:04:52,949 --> 02:04:56,174
So then again then.

2095
02:04:56,175 --> 02:05:00,340
I love you. Basically the default is cut the print.

2096
02:05:01,349 --> 02:05:04,331
Yeah, yeah. Maybe do better to count that spine,

2097
02:05:04,332 --> 02:05:06,773
but that default is, Cut the print. Right.

2098
02:05:07,007 --> 02:05:09,151
Yeah. I would do the cut again.

2099
02:05:09,481 --> 02:05:11,892
But I say out of the box, and then he has work.

2100
02:05:12,243 --> 02:05:15,687
I'll bet you don't, I mean, you were saying that this is an isolated

2101
02:05:15,688 --> 02:05:19,035
site or use of this and I'm looking at it early and with the

2102
02:05:19,036 --> 02:05:21,451
line. No. Yeah, it's the first one to go.

2103
02:05:21,452 --> 02:05:24,346
Oh, we're doing it before we're getting base plates and all the small parts

2104
02:05:24,347 --> 02:05:26,423
of the garden and they run through it. Yeah,

2105
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:29,859
so that makes sense. You might want to go ahead and change your- another

2106
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:32,546
cheap form of this here. We have time for length. That won't work on

2107
02:05:32,547 --> 02:05:36,198
the easy time of the stream as well. Yeah, it's just- because then keep

2108
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:41,481
getting back and we need to stay- I'm just afraid that you'll

2109
02:05:41,482 --> 02:05:45,816
get the same thing. good point. When we reach our literal step into our

2110
02:05:45,817 --> 02:05:47,827
track again. Yeah.

2111
02:05:48,742 --> 02:05:52,987
It should be new. Since April.

2112
02:05:52,988 --> 02:05:55,367
Yeah. this. It should be that bad and right dude,

2113
02:05:56,824 --> 02:05:58,473
just umm, got that. Okay, so you got both of those, but we added

2114
02:05:58,474 --> 02:06:00,568
the one at the bottom, right? But,

2115
02:06:00,569 --> 02:06:02,657
if you, if you wanted to- Get that bottom blue.

2116
02:06:03,972 --> 02:06:05,452
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Go get it. Alright, we'll see you

2117
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:20,615
You might not believe that,

2118
02:06:20,839 --> 02:06:24,209
that might be, you won't have to struggle when you get a fix,

2119
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:25,691
all this, you know how to change. Thank

2120
02:06:41,851 --> 02:06:44,820
Right, care about the most terrible. Uhh,

2121
02:06:44,821 --> 02:06:47,539
uhh, uhh,

2122
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:49,619
uhh, uhh, hm, hm, hm, hm,

2123
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:52,743
hm. . . Yeah, you hit me while the labor rate can not be

2124
02:06:52,744 --> 02:06:57,456
cheap. Just gonna go

2125
02:06:57,457 --> 02:07:00,263
up. Thanks. But you don't want to realize the most sort of union.

2126
02:07:03,061 --> 02:07:06,287
I'm sorry if you like that. So you can get in. can't do And

2127
02:07:06,288 --> 02:07:15,656
that's I'm that I've been here. Okay, so do it. You

2128
02:07:16,001 --> 02:07:16,841
gotta be. You

2129
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:28,338
You gotta be. See you I'm gonna

2130
02:07:28,339 --> 02:07:30,876
give you this.

2131
02:07:30,877 --> 02:07:33,999
Yeah, that's fine.

2132
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,048
Bye-bye. That's true. Let's go. I think.

2133
02:07:36,641 --> 02:07:45,115
You don't need one. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And

2134
02:07:45,116 --> 02:07:47,497
I'm gonna imagine that's still gonna be slow.

2135
02:07:48,332 --> 02:07:51,085
But. you There are no more.

2136
02:07:51,088 --> 02:07:53,981
Actually, I'm gonna be shaking it down a lot.

2137
02:07:53,982 --> 02:07:58,140
All right.

2138
02:07:58,141 --> 02:08:01,451
We'll see you bit later. Because it was usually with the like,

2139
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,250
at the very slow. Oh, yeah. I don't know what you want.

2140
02:08:04,251 --> 02:08:06,276
So I'm gonna sit on that with. Good.

2141
02:08:06,277 --> 02:08:08,505
With, um, student, uh, so,

2142
02:08:08,506 --> 02:08:11,128
I don't know what I but I mean, I think it's,

2143
02:08:11,129 --> 02:08:13,207
I mean, it'll be accurate.

2144
02:08:13,208 --> 02:08:17,237
Yeah. Yeah. It's more and more accurate.

2145
02:08:17,238 --> 02:08:37,196
Thank you. Don't

2146
02:08:37,197 --> 02:09:03,865
you dare- It's

2147
02:09:03,866 --> 02:09:04,670
being done. Good.

2148
02:09:30,691 --> 02:09:35,297
This

2149
02:09:35,298 --> 02:09:38,736
is why I know they're so person aggressive.

2150
02:09:38,737 --> 02:09:42,473
I can't always have any of that in my opinion that it's so person

2151
02:09:42,474 --> 02:09:48,695
aggressive. Thank you. If

2152
02:09:48,696 --> 02:09:51,279
you don't make one system up more easily, you should know.

2153
02:09:51,795 --> 02:09:52,050
Yeah. Thank you.

2154
02:10:18,931 --> 02:10:23,931
Let

2155
02:10:25,075 --> 02:10:26,940
me pull this out and do this. .

2156
02:10:35,011 --> 02:10:37,899
Want all the estimates that are,

2157
02:10:38,051 --> 02:10:41,382
that have you been there to be what they were when we,

2158
02:10:41,383 --> 02:10:43,536
we would need to be able to let it out. You know,

2159
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,563
little bit of labor are happy about it.

2160
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:49,187
So, you know, even the labor are happy and Monday or something, so it's

2161
02:10:49,188 --> 02:10:54,419
true. Must be a lot. Bye. and after the last

2162
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:57,978
video, I was like,

2163
02:10:57,979 --> 02:10:59,984
oh, uhh,

2164
02:10:59,994 --> 02:11:02,275
I think, and I think, then,

2165
02:11:02,534 --> 02:11:04,137
I don't think this has been as far as, you know, you should be

2166
02:11:04,138 --> 02:11:06,700
able to use. I this video.

2167
02:11:06,701 --> 02:11:09,863
Have a I'm going to Bye. I'm just looking at it.

2168
02:11:09,864 --> 02:11:12,625
So, so that's good.

2169
02:11:12,626 --> 02:11:16,693
Oh. Oh, You need to see it right,

2170
02:11:16,694 --> 02:11:19,156
and you're doing it all in a little bit from the water filter.

2171
02:11:19,157 --> 02:11:19,380
.

2172
02:11:31,291 --> 02:11:36,291
Go

2173
02:11:36,843 --> 02:11:39,331
ahead and order the vote to shut up.

2174
02:11:39,332 --> 02:11:43,484
I'm trying to do this a little bit.

2175
02:11:44,551 --> 02:11:48,296
So the farmer makes the cut. Bye. Yeah.

2176
02:11:51,201 --> 02:11:53,587
I think she must have said, uh,

2177
02:11:53,598 --> 02:11:55,891
on new work habits. Let us know the comments below.

2178
02:11:55,892 --> 02:11:57,963
He's really about,

2179
02:11:58,595 --> 02:12:05,605
basically saying he said, gospel hatred. Ha ha ha ha ha I

2180
02:12:05,606 --> 02:12:08,720
like to drink. What did you tell me to drink?

2181
02:12:08,721 --> 02:12:14,640
I didn't. Ah. Uh,

2182
02:12:14,651 --> 02:12:16,778
yeah, I was thinking that the database was all only a thing.

2183
02:12:16,779 --> 02:12:19,274
I don't have a chance to test it. I won't be able to do

2184
02:12:19,275 --> 02:12:22,028
this. Uh. . I'm not trying to mess up with that for.

2185
02:12:22,039 --> 02:12:25,725
Obviously, you didn't get any loot, because you used to sell it.

2186
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:27,936
Ah, yep. Now I wish I had a good time serving for everyone.

2187
02:12:27,937 --> 02:12:30,495
Eww. I'll pick the hell up.

2188
02:12:30,496 --> 02:12:33,289
Eams. See you in a video of that. That'll make you come early and

2189
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:35,400
you'll find me to be lost inside the chicken. Yeah.

2190
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:41,449
Yeah. That's what we are for sittin'

2191
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:43,951
in this. Yes.

2192
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:58,058
Last day of the night, at the facility, the last day of the dispute.

2193
02:12:58,059 --> 02:13:00,668
See you next time. Yeah,

2194
02:13:00,669 --> 02:13:04,375
so that's what I'm supposed to be doing in this room.

2195
02:13:04,516 --> 02:13:07,951
That was like, there's one in the environment, a lot of them. There's the-

2196
02:13:07,952 --> 02:13:10,924
environment, a lot of them. But that's a separate term.

2197
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:13,590
Seven. That's why I think Chris is mine.

2198
02:13:15,171 --> 02:13:18,175
We have one. the ah, so I was like a secret,

2199
02:13:18,176 --> 02:13:23,236
but we had one yard that was a

2200
02:13:23,237 --> 02:13:27,103
piece of- Oh, the was digging into something that we were weak on.

2201
02:13:27,289 --> 02:13:31,467
He would take that now, you know, they'd rather trim a bit of stuff

2202
02:13:31,468 --> 02:13:34,628
than- Just abbreviate to- I don't know.

2203
02:13:34,629 --> 02:13:37,631
He's a hot black man. Come on.

2204
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:42,773
Okay, we have to- And I see- And I see- and- Alright,

2205
02:13:43,428 --> 02:13:48,085
okay. Come on, I have to- See you guys soon.

2206
02:13:48,086 --> 02:13:51,937
And I feel not every one of you that can't even do something unless

2207
02:13:51,938 --> 02:13:54,169
you're next already like, why are you doing that?

2208
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:56,302
So I can- You gotta- Don't let me do it. But,

2209
02:13:56,916 --> 02:13:59,764
it didn't, it didn't, it didn't repair, it didn't consist.

2210
02:14:00,016 --> 02:14:02,034
Why it's been two other extemements.

2211
02:14:02,035 --> 02:14:05,554
And I probably changed,

2212
02:14:05,555 --> 02:14:07,606
uhm, one of,

2213
02:14:07,757 --> 02:14:10,497
one of them is, kind of, for one view,

2214
02:14:10,498 --> 02:14:12,949
one is going to purify the appeal. You know, they could,

2215
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:16,127
they could profit change, but. Yeah,

2216
02:14:16,128 --> 02:14:20,136
one's other, someone's other.

2217
02:14:20,137 --> 02:14:22,908
No. I think it will,

2218
02:14:22,909 --> 02:14:27,318
it should be one point to that hours for peace deal and then I

2219
02:14:27,319 --> 02:14:30,143
think the other one is- Let's come in front of all the- the bigger

2220
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:34,728
operations that say other. We'll get it

2221
02:14:34,729 --> 02:14:38,109
solid and make it one new. Thank you very much. They changed the label

2222
02:14:38,110 --> 02:14:41,281
more, so we know which label is which. Alright,

2223
02:14:41,282 --> 02:14:44,251
it's alright. Biggest thing in heaven. Good.

2224
02:14:44,252 --> 02:14:46,276
Umm,

2225
02:14:46,287 --> 02:14:48,302
I swear to you, this, uh,

2226
02:14:48,313 --> 02:14:51,703
says that the group certainly leaves. F*** you.

2227
02:14:51,704 --> 02:14:54,054
F*** you. I can't have a lot of- Tell me where there was a

2228
02:14:54,055 --> 02:14:57,099
woman who couldn't. I think it's something that I actually had a prescription,

2229
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:01,951
which honestly didn't. And,

2230
02:15:01,952 --> 02:15:06,806
. It just

2231
02:15:06,859 --> 02:15:09,698
in. Yep.

2232
02:15:09,829 --> 02:15:10,760
That's fine. Bye.

2233
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:39,076
So it might be the same thing.

2234
02:15:43,275 --> 02:15:45,313
I was so very careful. If investigation,

2235
02:15:45,314 --> 02:15:47,862
that would be beautiful.

2236
02:15:47,863 --> 02:15:47,580
Thank you.

2237
02:15:52,591 --> 02:15:56,669
And the other guy didn't increase my height. He increased my height.

2238
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:59,570
He didn't increase my height. So,

2239
02:15:59,571 --> 02:16:02,124
yeah. But wasn't he,

2240
02:16:02,125 --> 02:16:05,248
uh, he was 140 feet,

2241
02:16:05,249 --> 02:16:07,960
uh, where we also had an 18-bit.

2242
02:16:07,850 --> 02:16:10,253
Good. Good. So,

2243
02:16:10,543 --> 02:16:13,810
which was close to,

2244
02:16:13,811 --> 02:16:16,449
uh, close to under that.

2245
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:18,659
Good. Okay.

2246
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:27,422
. started

2247
02:16:27,423 --> 02:16:31,100
me.

2248
02:16:30,181 --> 02:16:32,791
You

2249
02:16:40,831 --> 02:16:44,485
The sun's just got that,

2250
02:16:44,486 --> 02:16:48,948
that's pretty sweet and cold and everything.

2251
02:16:57,031 --> 02:16:59,867
Okay.

2252
02:16:59,868 --> 02:17:00,661
Okay.

2253
02:17:23,071 --> 02:17:27,558
I don't know if you're a super offensive,

2254
02:17:28,884 --> 02:17:33,614
or if you can. I what it is is we just figured out that

2255
02:17:33,615 --> 02:17:38,377
since we're not pushing our projects over and trying

2256
02:17:38,378 --> 02:17:43,052
to sync all of our stuff. Umm, we can now be at the minimum

2257
02:17:43,053 --> 02:17:46,965
of planning and still do small asking.

2258
02:17:46,966 --> 02:17:50,987
the board . . And proposals and changes and stuff inside of this is

2259
02:17:50,988 --> 02:17:53,502
someone that you are using in your system, uhh,

2260
02:17:53,513 --> 02:17:56,721
but for a while there is space that- I'm really into some literal state

2261
02:17:56,722 --> 02:18:00,869
of church, like, you know, serious cash,

2262
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:03,151
but it's not well in here. I'm scared.

2263
02:18:03,152 --> 02:18:05,335
If I didn't use it for us to close it and stuff,

2264
02:18:05,336 --> 02:18:08,246
yeah, it was a tackle and get rid of it.

2265
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,136
Yeah. So, if you like it.

2266
02:18:11,137 --> 02:18:13,906
I began to describe the games here so that I can support it over

2267
02:18:13,907 --> 02:18:17,932
the phone. Yes. Yeah.

2268
02:18:17,402 --> 02:18:17,932
Yeah.

2269
02:18:21,972 --> 02:18:23,136
So I understand what they're facing this out. So if you don't have access

2270
02:18:23,137 --> 02:18:25,548
to the local treasury of the system. Oh,

2271
02:18:25,565 --> 02:18:28,946
so don't you? Tell me next. So what is the new system,

2272
02:18:28,947 --> 02:18:32,951
Joseph? Umm, the new system is to not understanding how you build it.

2273
02:18:33,698 --> 02:18:38,383
And it's gonna be, Whether they're in a base in and in a candidate

2274
02:18:38,384 --> 02:18:43,176
proposals in general, 100% investigating experience.

2275
02:18:43,177 --> 02:18:46,298
It's a cackler, and you can get it in for courses on anything for

2276
02:18:46,299 --> 02:18:49,009
games. So, it's not like it's going to be a cackler,

2277
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:51,151
heavy bed, heavy work. Oh.

2278
02:18:50,112 --> 02:18:53,644
Oh. Yeah.

2279
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:57,245
Do not want us to be continuing on this,

2280
02:18:57,351 --> 02:18:59,872
but, I mean, up until,

2281
02:18:59,873 --> 02:19:01,946
like, last week, this awesome revolution,

2282
02:19:01,947 --> 02:19:05,475
Nashville. So, they clearly have made changes in here,

2283
02:19:05,476 --> 02:19:09,168
and now this is all of them. This is actually reflecting that you can

2284
02:19:09,169 --> 02:19:12,029
by generating the whole amount of shows along early in the year,

2285
02:19:12,030 --> 02:19:15,513
uh, the tutorials. Just last week when I j- I mean,

2286
02:19:15,514 --> 02:19:18,457
the proposal for a day that I submitted, did what I saw.

2287
02:19:19,117 --> 02:19:21,858
It was good for you. You can have a good place at the time.

2288
02:19:22,284 --> 02:19:24,765
You can add. Yeah. Well, maybe it's every now and then.

2289
02:19:24,866 --> 02:19:29,349
Zero, six, zero, nine. What's the difference?

2290
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:32,994
What's the- What's the difference?

2291
02:19:32,995 --> 02:19:37,654
What's the

2292
02:19:37,655 --> 02:19:41,491
difference? Uhh, okay. I guess it's kind of the same. Similar software that says

2293
02:19:41,492 --> 02:19:43,994
a different structure to it. Um,

2294
02:19:44,005 --> 02:19:46,653
this was set up with everything.

2295
02:19:46,654 --> 02:19:49,171
your name. Being overhead,

2296
02:19:49,429 --> 02:19:51,525
structured, built into your numbers.

2297
02:19:51,646 --> 02:19:55,171
Heavy is very, overhead. head.

2298
02:19:55,172 --> 02:19:58,721
It has its own mind and it's... and broke it out a lot.

2299
02:19:58,744 --> 02:20:01,211
Very, each labor I've distracted its own extent.

2300
02:20:01,212 --> 02:20:05,672
Thank slide. So a lot more visibility for everything,

2301
02:20:05,673 --> 02:20:08,666
not support, whereas this has a lot of unknowns,

2302
02:20:08,667 --> 02:20:11,191
one can do this with what we know covers.

2303
02:20:11,192 --> 02:20:13,760
So this heavy band is important,

2304
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:16,108
uh, yeah. Yeah,

2305
02:20:16,169 --> 02:20:18,612
heavy band is just really, uhm,

2306
02:20:18,623 --> 02:20:23,245
they have a little bit of a I need it to do their field

2307
02:20:23,281 --> 02:20:27,211
take offs and do all that and stuff in there.

2308
02:20:27,212 --> 02:20:29,860
Umm, or you can do something similar in there,

2309
02:20:30,027 --> 02:20:33,220
but having it as a lot more of, uh,

2310
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:35,697
all on your tutors and processes. But it's,

2311
02:20:35,698 --> 02:20:38,054
it's not, it's not,

2312
02:20:38,055 --> 02:20:41,186
it's not step. Okay,

2313
02:20:41,703 --> 02:20:43,956
so then it really, it's heavy, dude. You actually.

2314
02:20:45,819 --> 02:20:47,929
Yeah. This is important.

2315
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:50,566
Yeah. And since. Yeah,

2316
02:20:50,567 --> 02:20:53,113
so I. Bye. Yeah,

2317
02:20:53,114 --> 02:20:56,025
this one,

2318
02:20:56,026 --> 02:20:58,616
we went in 150 hours. Well, I mean, I still.

2319
02:20:58,617 --> 02:21:01,479
You Okay. Okay.

2320
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:03,707
Okay. Okay.

2321
02:21:03,708 --> 02:21:10,295
Okay. I don't know if it's the same. Thank

2322
02:21:10,296 --> 02:21:14,460
you.

2323
02:21:14,461 --> 02:21:17,449
Yes. Yeah. So,

2324
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:20,092
and what I plugged in for eight was seventy hours.

2325
02:21:20,093 --> 02:21:24,050
We'll see you So,

2326
02:21:24,051 --> 02:21:26,925
wings pretty close, and fair,

2327
02:21:26,926 --> 02:21:32,129
it is slightly different. We're

2328
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:36,622
helping with people in mind to obtain with,

2329
02:21:36,623 --> 02:21:39,632
uhh, what we put in the rate.

2330
02:21:39,633 --> 02:21:44,166
Great. without considering the

2331
02:21:44,167 --> 02:21:48,007
efficiency. So I can put that at a home really- Thank you,

2332
02:21:48,008 --> 02:21:52,393
bye. I can't believe that. You're simply-ish.

2333
02:21:53,113 --> 02:21:55,854
So you kinda gotta figure out what to do there.

2334
02:21:55,657 --> 02:22:01,673
There. So

2335
02:22:01,674 --> 02:22:04,656
efficiency what, docks to, hours or docks to dollars?

2336
02:22:04,657 --> 02:22:09,295
dollars. So if it's at 90%

2337
02:22:09,296 --> 02:22:12,451
efficiency what it does,

2338
02:22:12,452 --> 02:22:16,540
it takes the cap. The calculation of the hours divides by .9 to .9.

2339
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:21,685
So, that's officially

2340
02:22:21,686 --> 02:22:26,730
part of the- I don't know where I'm at, it's just going

2341
02:22:27,123 --> 02:22:30,211
to be. So, umm, to me, the-the next biggest concern- So.

2342
02:22:30,212 --> 02:22:35,429
Yeah, I know the trouble I

2343
02:22:35,430 --> 02:22:38,094
always would be in use from here typically if I'm out of a second.

2344
02:22:38,158 --> 02:22:42,412
Good, good, But it's telling me where to serve you then.

2345
02:22:43,116 --> 02:22:46,651
So we need to do that. We're that distribution when I was in here.

2346
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:02,580
And a lot of times if I'm not completely loaded up or something. I'm

2347
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:06,911
back and start. If they didn't use that one to do it,

2348
02:23:06,912 --> 02:23:10,424
I'll have a link around the last minute so that there's something in here.

2349
02:23:10,425 --> 02:23:12,706
You that has this breakout. Yeah,

2350
02:23:12,707 --> 02:23:17,270
it was of this point. It was all in some independent and general of

2351
02:23:17,271 --> 02:23:20,376
the category that they had here. So,

2352
02:23:20,377 --> 02:23:24,953
now this has worked out a way that my form is requesting the

2353
02:23:24,954 --> 02:23:27,107
information that he gave into me. Yeah. And,

2354
02:23:27,108 --> 02:23:30,083
uh, I think it's going to be a fair cause of beneficial.

2355
02:23:30,133 --> 02:23:32,557
I think I've heard it yesterday before.

2356
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:36,965
Wait a little bit, it's almost time to be here. . So the ratio

2357
02:23:36,966 --> 02:23:40,041
of hearing, I think that's why there is the ratio between fit up and

2358
02:23:40,042 --> 02:23:42,931
well, is never right coming out of the tackle.

2359
02:23:42,932 --> 02:23:46,751
And you gotta make the adjustments to take it.

2360
02:23:47,108 --> 02:23:49,502
Well, it's time to move it to the fit out time.

2361
02:23:49,944 --> 02:23:53,029
Yeah, I think I was- I heard something bad, yeah.

2362
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:55,140
Uh, uh, let's have a look right at this,

2363
02:23:55,141 --> 02:23:58,740
uh, when I especially in this little situation- Thank you.

2364
02:23:59,011 --> 02:24:03,740
I that it's a real worry. And now you can see this change

2365
02:24:03,741 --> 02:24:06,144
work program here. If this will stop,

2366
02:24:06,145 --> 02:24:08,218
can't even- You I mean, yeah,

2367
02:24:08,219 --> 02:24:10,633
he's safer, I have him. Yeah,

2368
02:24:10,634 --> 02:24:14,520
I mean work as a field. I think it's their field instructions. Yeah,

2369
02:24:14,521 --> 02:24:18,054
thanks for watching. Yeah, Yeah. What are they using? Period.

2370
02:24:19,847 --> 02:24:22,043
You say here at the library, we're at this facility,

2371
02:24:22,044 --> 02:24:24,146
not involved. Oh. So,

2372
02:24:24,664 --> 02:24:28,027
in love, I've got no idea. Oh, no. They're just going to have to

2373
02:24:28,268 --> 02:24:32,591
have pensive. Yeah. That's We did it for estimating.

2374
02:24:32,928 --> 02:24:34,988
Okay. Just, what, what,

2375
02:24:34,989 --> 02:24:37,110
what was the field that occurred in the software?

2376
02:24:37,111 --> 02:24:39,131
Umm, yes.

2377
02:24:38,901 --> 02:24:41,525
Yes. Just, I'm not sure over there,

2378
02:24:41,526 --> 02:24:43,892
everyone's been honest. I've heard of this work,

2379
02:24:43,893 --> 02:24:46,707
but I don't know who I heard it from again and we've been meeting

2380
02:24:46,708 --> 02:24:52,939
with you this year. I changed so much.

2381
02:24:52,940 --> 02:24:55,211
So, uhm. Yeah, so this.

2382
02:24:55,212 --> 02:24:55,140
Yes.

2383
02:24:59,716 --> 02:25:01,027
This is the ASM in Jackbun. This is what it's about to be your

2384
02:25:01,028 --> 02:25:03,331
new strip floor. I'll see you one.

2385
02:25:03,332 --> 02:25:07,732
You know, a hundred and fifty hours will be estimated for this originally.

2386
02:25:08,579 --> 02:25:11,371
And this was the manual break-up.

2387
02:25:11,372 --> 02:25:14,399
That was put together on this. And then,

2388
02:25:16,244 --> 02:25:18,653
this is what we have.

2389
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:24,500
So. Thank you. Well,

2390
02:25:24,501 --> 02:25:27,072
my question then would be.

2391
02:25:27,073 --> 02:25:30,308
you That's right.

2392
02:25:30,565 --> 02:25:35,149
And, eh, it's, it's gonna be

2393
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:39,913
fresh. Thank you very If we can adjust it a little

2394
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:42,419
bit, it's just a little bit, what,

2395
02:25:42,723 --> 02:25:45,093
what did you grab? Like, are they,

2396
02:25:45,764 --> 02:25:49,235
are they, and I'm assuming Mark's uh,

2397
02:25:49,246 --> 02:25:51,491
doing this person. Yeah.

2398
02:25:51,492 --> 02:25:54,481
it. So, it is that,

2399
02:25:54,482 --> 02:25:58,650
um.

2400
02:25:58,661 --> 02:26:02,201
It was also a new person. So, But, as you can see,

2401
02:26:02,617 --> 02:26:05,853
we can see, well,

2402
02:26:05,854 --> 02:26:08,161
as close as it is.

2403
02:26:08,162 --> 02:26:13,856
And No, no, no, no. We're going to expose what is

2404
02:26:13,857 --> 02:26:15,940
going on. That's, uh, so 20-30.

2405
02:26:16,296 --> 02:26:19,034
What's happening? What's happening?

2406
02:26:19,035 --> 02:26:21,431
What's happening?

2407
02:26:21,432 --> 02:26:24,079
What's happening?

2408
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:27,048
Yeah. That's like, I've never done this to anybody.

2409
02:26:27,049 --> 02:26:32,316
I've never done that to anybody. I've never done And even until,

2410
02:26:32,317 --> 02:26:35,368
You know, back in you That's it.

2411
02:26:35,369 --> 02:26:40,291
That's, ,swips just like that to you.

2412
02:26:40,292 --> 02:26:44,316
So you're right. I should see where the differences are again.

2413
02:26:46,684 --> 02:26:51,219
I can see the reason you want to, I'm not going 100% because

2414
02:26:51,291 --> 02:26:53,329
you're like, well, I'm not going to take speed out.

2415
02:26:53,529 --> 02:26:56,311
And then you make the adjustments. Thanks. Thank you.

2416
02:26:56,188 --> 02:26:59,914
You run over 75% we want to get that number closer.

2417
02:27:01,056 --> 02:27:03,412
But estimating at the lower rate,

2418
02:27:03,999 --> 02:27:06,822
that's it. Just adds another tweaking factor in.

2419
02:27:08,698 --> 02:27:12,331
So, a little bit closer. Thank you.

2420
02:27:12,332 --> 02:27:16,443
But, it will also say, no one reminds a public channel or something.

2421
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:20,311
And the problem is, listen, one day or another.

2422
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:27,311
One day there was a building six lines that were on one day and

2423
02:27:27,312 --> 02:27:28,072
they were building a little room. And then over the next day they were

2424
02:27:28,073 --> 02:27:28,910
throwing boxes at me and next. And then the next. Thanks. Okay, we're gonna

2425
02:27:28,911 --> 02:27:32,111
start from comming with the exit, and in the effort that we like,

2426
02:27:32,133 --> 02:27:34,178
we might have said, it officially has to be more.

2427
02:27:34,914 --> 02:27:37,973
It's going to help all the work. You know, you don't have a really

2428
02:27:37,974 --> 02:27:41,369
good system going, and one thing, you get your thoughts a little bit.

2429
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:44,280
Yeah, thank you. I did 75%.

2430
02:27:44,371 --> 02:27:50,225
I can't get way out of here. Looks like he's over

2431
02:27:50,226 --> 02:27:52,596
here, Carlos. Release. 8 People,

2432
02:27:52,597 --> 02:27:55,728
uh, people are putting on something that's really just meant to be here for

2433
02:27:55,729 --> 02:27:56,780
all this discussion. question.

2434
02:28:07,102 --> 02:28:08,371
So it looks like you're using the basic breakdown, so I'm already in that.

2435
02:28:08,372 --> 02:28:11,826
But he's redistributing fit up and whaling,

2436
02:28:11,827 --> 02:28:14,018
redistributing, handling it cut.

2437
02:28:15,018 --> 02:28:19,626
Cause the fit up whaling- is essential with it on both the tunnels and

2438
02:28:19,627 --> 02:28:22,255
both are essentially the same amount. Yeah.

2439
02:28:22,509 --> 02:28:25,900
So it looks like he's redistributing it. I'm going this group,

2440
02:28:25,901 --> 02:28:28,595
you mean it? Excuse me? Umm,

2441
02:28:28,606 --> 02:28:32,436
I'm going to be it. Let's see what the difference in the word is.

2442
02:28:32,437 --> 02:28:36,557
There are a few years to like that. Sixty-one fours you've done for,

2443
02:28:36,558 --> 02:28:39,244
uh, no hours. The bottom one in the center.

2444
02:28:39,245 --> 02:28:41,946
Mm-hmm. . It's a big life.

2445
02:28:41,947 --> 02:28:45,439
It's a life. It's about 120.

2446
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:47,806
Oh. Cause you got 61 and 35.

2447
02:28:47,807 --> 02:28:52,623
That's 100. 119.

2448
02:28:52,624 --> 02:28:55,360
Told me. We got 40% of the difference in weight.

2449
02:28:55,361 --> 02:28:58,115
I'll go and get and go back. I'm doing the power fabric work.

2450
02:28:58,972 --> 02:29:01,748
You're up to maintenance, uh,

2451
02:29:01,758 --> 02:29:03,838
estimating the weight of maintenance.

2452
02:29:03,839 --> 02:29:08,956
And you're up. One-fifth

2453
02:29:08,957 --> 02:29:11,382
of the action. One-fifth is the December when we saw the job before.

2454
02:29:11,383 --> 02:29:13,796
It was one night scene. And there was that outreach.

2455
02:29:14,054 --> 02:29:18,359
That's why I've never seen that do. You're at the Bill and Will manual

2456
02:29:18,373 --> 02:29:19,256
quarter hitch. Okay.

2457
02:29:29,311 --> 02:29:31,680
To get 6.3. So,

2458
02:29:32,166 --> 02:29:36,055
I consider this way that that's why I was looking at 40% of the

2459
02:29:36,056 --> 02:29:38,311
difference. I consider this way.

2460
02:29:38,312 --> 02:29:42,317
40% is what I usually will see in the right per hour around came

2461
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:46,260
to loyalty. So, the pancake is around 40%.

2462
02:29:46,291 --> 02:29:48,804
Uh, uh, 40% difference.

2463
02:29:49,301 --> 02:29:51,473
So, uh,

2464
02:29:51,494 --> 02:29:54,336
yeah, I'm wondering if we change.

2465
02:29:54,337 --> 02:29:56,888
It's not going to stay this up.

2466
02:29:57,377 --> 02:29:59,765
Now you're way out of time so it will come down.

2467
02:29:59,945 --> 02:30:01,815
Then we'll be in the week and we'll read and share to you. Thank

2468
02:30:01,816 --> 02:30:06,411
you. You

2469
02:30:06,412 --> 02:30:07,429
guys need to be like all of us. You just change your order next

2470
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:10,036
one and make the other ones go. Yeah,

2471
02:30:10,037 --> 02:30:12,109
alright. That, out of the box,

2472
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:16,328
the, the, if you put a, uhm, a field middle or something,

2473
02:30:16,329 --> 02:30:18,134
out of the box you just don't control it. I wish you all a

2474
02:30:18,135 --> 02:30:26,530
little bit. So,

2475
02:30:26,531 --> 02:30:29,013
uhm,

2476
02:30:29,024 --> 02:30:32,529
we can change those, those, you and that language and see where it gives

2477
02:30:32,530 --> 02:30:34,649
and, yeah, you, you sort of, So,

2478
02:30:35,043 --> 02:30:39,209
so let me ask you this, when, when this calculation happens for quarter inch,

2479
02:30:40,018 --> 02:30:42,336
they'll run a single pass publicly. Welcome.

2480
02:30:42,337 --> 02:30:45,521
Yeah, depending on the type of world,

2481
02:30:45,538 --> 02:30:48,870
we hear it corners, we say there are more of compasses.

2482
02:30:49,025 --> 02:30:52,113
But, it really is. So,

2483
02:30:52,114 --> 02:30:56,390
how does the math go in?

2484
02:30:56,391 --> 02:31:01,384
You're just looking at the right. It's not big. . It's gonna be right,

2485
02:31:01,385 --> 02:31:03,384
but it's gonna extrapolate against the length. It's gonna hold by and by the

2486
02:31:03,385 --> 02:31:05,788
length. So if you put, uh, let's, let's take some,

2487
02:31:05,789 --> 02:31:09,148
let's, let's. My rate is five feet per hour for three days.

2488
02:31:09,738 --> 02:31:13,476
That's what I don't have to shoot at. I know guys can go faster

2489
02:31:13,477 --> 02:31:18,204
than that. But that's just the estimating rate for a three-cast level.

2490
02:31:18,205 --> 02:31:20,646
When it's half-inch, you're gonna do six-mass.

2491
02:31:20,647 --> 02:31:23,484
We'll the next one. Whatever five minutes.

2492
02:31:23,766 --> 02:31:27,935
In the corner each group, I'm used to seeing as Ken put,

2493
02:31:27,936 --> 02:31:30,215
and you can wail a whole lot faster than that up.

2494
02:31:30,216 --> 02:31:32,555
Go. Honestly, that's one,

2495
02:31:32,556 --> 02:31:37,124
that's where the most people are being put in that language for estimating

2496
02:31:37,125 --> 02:31:39,577
purposes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, you got to figure out,

2497
02:31:39,894 --> 02:31:42,497
you know, what she put in that again. That's a lot of time.

2498
02:31:42,558 --> 02:31:44,766
What is, what is that, the system?

2499
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,380
What does it do to see her? The machine,

2500
02:31:47,381 --> 02:31:50,043
uh, sure, is not going to be an example.

2501
02:31:50,076 --> 02:31:52,393
I'm going to take a stakeboard on that paper,

2502
02:31:52,394 --> 02:31:54,396
so I'm going to have a similar game. Anyway, good So so. Thank you.

2503
02:31:54,397 --> 02:31:57,067
Yeah, so, uhm,

2504
02:31:57,078 --> 02:31:59,285
that's an interesting thing about your main book,

2505
02:31:59,286 --> 02:32:01,498
right? Do you want yes,

2506
02:32:01,499 --> 02:32:04,615
that you're going to make a- I don't know if,

2507
02:32:04,616 --> 02:32:06,948
uhm, obviously it's what it would be wanting to be. Okay,

2508
02:32:06,949 --> 02:32:09,617
well that's it. Cause like, we could get to see if we're going to

2509
02:32:09,618 --> 02:32:12,579
get that something Okay, what's the pattern in the stitch right?

2510
02:32:13,009 --> 02:32:15,342
Yeah, it's right. Yeah. That's what it means.

2511
02:32:15,343 --> 02:32:17,656
It's just a right. Now I've built stitch for it.

2512
02:32:17,657 --> 02:32:21,061
That's what it's going paper patterns. Umm,

2513
02:32:21,082 --> 02:32:23,160
but all it is is just a right.

2514
02:32:23,161 --> 02:32:25,653
So consider what you want. You have to consider.

2515
02:32:25,951 --> 02:32:28,862
I can Good. You have Maybe you'll be,

2516
02:32:28,863 --> 02:32:32,642
uh, you have to, uh, for God willing if I wanted to.

2517
02:32:32,643 --> 02:32:36,267
I'm just hoping you'll never even want to. I'm not taking the process here.

2518
02:32:36,318 --> 02:32:41,263
If. Kind of flip

2519
02:32:41,264 --> 02:32:44,423
flat. Okay. Uh,

2520
02:32:44,434 --> 02:32:47,251
when you probably won't be on your main shop, cause that's the one that,

2521
02:32:47,919 --> 02:32:53,687
that your needs are right. Bye. Uh,

2522
02:32:53,698 --> 02:32:55,818
which, which main, uh, I guess,

2523
02:32:55,819 --> 02:32:58,471
uh, I was thinking, not clear, I was thinking back.

2524
02:32:58,472 --> 02:33:02,043
This is the one that we had last time you were here so that

2525
02:33:02,044 --> 02:33:04,346
we could speak numbers.

2526
02:33:06,511 --> 02:33:08,613
You can be looking around. Ah,

2527
02:33:08,947 --> 02:33:12,151
so, we're back in the answer, we'll be back in a minute.

2528
02:33:12,409 --> 02:33:14,581
Yeah, I don't wanna know what to be used to best. Yes, yes, That's

2529
02:33:14,582 --> 02:33:16,687
the name. Yeah, me,

2530
02:33:16,688 --> 02:33:18,799
that's the one to change.

2531
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,470
Thank you. So,

2532
02:33:21,471 --> 02:33:23,714
did we want it there? Thank you. I didn't go to, uhm,

2533
02:33:23,725 --> 02:33:26,577
three eights, put in your, what did you say? I asked you to say

2534
02:33:26,578 --> 02:33:30,352
anything. That's right,

2535
02:33:30,353 --> 02:33:32,639
I actually have much slower. or if yeah.

2536
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:36,398
It's just whatever is the standard here.

2537
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:40,013
I'm used to using five feet or no. I did. in you want to

2538
02:33:40,014 --> 02:33:42,415
do, like, five, six feet, somewhere in between there,

2539
02:33:42,416 --> 02:33:45,351
the calendar. Hey,

2540
02:33:45,352 --> 02:33:47,439
jesus. So, take it back and fix the money.

2541
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:50,894
Bye Thanks, too.

2542
02:33:50,895 --> 02:33:53,362
Bye. Yeah.

2543
02:33:55,591 --> 02:34:00,591
So,

2544
02:34:00,982 --> 02:34:04,413
so what happens is, you know, you ask me if I'm not gonna sell

2545
02:34:04,414 --> 02:34:06,757
it. But when you guys do these beams,

2546
02:34:06,758 --> 02:34:11,488
these built-ups, and now you go from an annual

2547
02:34:11,489 --> 02:34:16,147
process, so. Just. A mark. At the estimating state,

2548
02:34:16,148 --> 02:34:18,215
would they ever do that, or in the future,

2549
02:34:18,216 --> 02:34:20,364
will they do that, or is it gonna have a.

2550
02:34:20,365 --> 02:34:24,775
you sub arc, or sub arc is still encapsulated within well.

2551
02:34:24,776 --> 02:34:27,673
Cause I know me, right? I'm for data, I'm creating a government.

2552
02:34:27,674 --> 02:34:29,688
Are you guys able to- You're going to use them a lot,

2553
02:34:29,689 --> 02:34:32,381
and we're going to have to get it down the lane. But I don't

2554
02:34:33,573 --> 02:34:35,740
really know what to say. I wouldn't do it yet, so yeah.

2555
02:34:36,090 --> 02:34:40,928
If I- I don't really think it, because we know that when we weld

2556
02:34:40,929 --> 02:34:45,243
some work on a boom, we know the machine can do 20- inches of

2557
02:34:45,244 --> 02:34:47,374
minute. But we know,

2558
02:34:47,375 --> 02:34:50,181
uh, and it's a two pass weld for us all the way up to

2559
02:34:50,182 --> 02:34:52,536
half inch. Thank much.

2560
02:34:52,537 --> 02:34:55,498
Inside, outside, two pass weld are done.

2561
02:34:56,143 --> 02:34:59,558
You know. Yeah, and nothing was more of the,

2562
02:34:59,559 --> 02:35:03,799
uh. and We don't think I'm gonna date right now to,

2563
02:35:03,842 --> 02:35:05,973
because you did one job and you couldn't do it.

2564
02:35:06,751 --> 02:35:09,516
But if you start up doing some work welding longer.

2565
02:35:09,517 --> 02:35:12,118
Yeah. You need to deal with that,

2566
02:35:12,119 --> 02:35:15,199
because that's not something. I'm gonna be sharp most and we'll be laying up

2567
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:17,556
to get you up with what the assembly was.

2568
02:35:17,557 --> 02:35:19,942
They were working on the shot done, but they,

2569
02:35:20,551 --> 02:35:22,894
they won the shot. Yeah,

2570
02:35:22,895 --> 02:35:25,376
I didn't deal with it out there. It's too dandy.

2571
02:35:25,377 --> 02:35:27,747
There you go. But they, they, when it came down,

2572
02:35:27,748 --> 02:35:31,923
they, they, they, they saw it, and it was the same thing as about

2573
02:35:31,924 --> 02:35:34,966
getting it. If, where you got to go? . Like this,

2574
02:35:34,967 --> 02:35:37,040
or if you guys were bawling it, like this,

2575
02:35:38,149 --> 02:35:41,748
or showing me that. Like this? Yeah. And Yeah,

2576
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:45,157
it's important to bring one way back.

2577
02:35:45,158 --> 02:35:49,536
It's important. So, and then we're lagging about.

2578
02:35:49,537 --> 02:35:52,676
One and, and meaning,

2579
02:35:52,677 --> 02:35:55,083
uhm, evenly, that's a two minute round.

2580
02:35:55,462 --> 02:35:57,571
So, uhm, bye.

2581
02:35:57,572 --> 02:36:02,119
What do you do? What do you do?

2582
02:36:02,771 --> 02:36:05,300
Why do you gotta find everything in the table and see if I can

2583
02:36:05,301 --> 02:36:05,455
see.

2584
02:36:13,591 --> 02:36:16,212
That's the most terrible thing on the air. In this channel,

2585
02:36:16,213 --> 02:36:19,221
it's a kind thing. Yeah. Oh my god.

2586
02:36:19,222 --> 02:36:21,576
Cheers. Thank very much.

2587
02:36:21,577 --> 02:36:23,730
At least there's four or five of them at all.

2588
02:36:24,238 --> 02:36:26,850
Yeah. Yeah.

2589
02:36:26,851 --> 02:36:29,556
Yeah, and those ones are uhm,

2590
02:36:29,557 --> 02:36:31,694
How many of them have been out for? They've done a little bit.

2591
02:36:31,695 --> 02:36:34,296
We've actually got 10 foot, 5, 16,

2592
02:36:34,297 --> 02:36:36,727
8, 6. It creates 5 foot.

2593
02:36:37,303 --> 02:36:39,382
Then, How about 3, 16, 10,

2594
02:36:39,383 --> 02:36:42,632
1, 8? 3, 16, 8, what's with them? 7,

2595
02:36:42,633 --> 02:36:45,160
2, 1.

2596
02:36:45,161 --> 02:36:47,540
I'm out of 7, 10,

2597
02:36:47,541 --> 02:36:49,767
1, 8. Yeah,

2598
02:36:49,768 --> 02:36:52,710
and we've got to support him. Yeah,

2599
02:36:52,711 --> 02:36:54,917
it was not him. Yeah.

2600
02:36:54,918 --> 02:36:53,760
Go ahead.

2601
02:37:10,951 --> 02:37:13,515
Oh, I have to check, you know, I guess they should have gotten that

2602
02:37:13,516 --> 02:37:15,626
done by speaking to the program. Ah,

2603
02:37:15,627 --> 02:37:18,991
but having them do it, or is that going to be better or something?

2604
02:37:18,992 --> 02:37:22,232
. And, uh,

2605
02:37:22,243 --> 02:37:24,733
creates a half inch. Yeah, you know that way,

2606
02:37:24,734 --> 02:37:26,737
so you can come here a little bit, and well, it's later on.

2607
02:37:26,738 --> 02:37:28,790
And now, I'm go. You've got to do that, uhm.

2608
02:37:28,801 --> 02:37:32,838
And then some people are going to be to get a single vowel and

2609
02:37:32,878 --> 02:37:36,638
a double vowel. Yeah. Thank Yeah,

2610
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:39,261
I mean, like I said, you can not be able to touch it any

2611
02:37:39,262 --> 02:37:41,309
minute and skip the vowel vowel.

2612
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:46,667
Alright, so leave. Brock the way of demoing down the finger

2613

2614
02:37:49,024 --> 02:37:51,156
And of the video.

They're facing the port for two percent. Yeah.

2626
02:38:31,357 --> 02:38:33,903
No. Wasn't trying to see what it does.

02:38:33,904 --> 02:38:34,334
Thanks for watching.

2628
02:38:39,631 --> 02:38:43,352

oh, oh. I don't understand who's in India.

2630
02:38:47,672 --> 02:38:50,116
I haven't been for shots,

2631
02:38:50,117 --> 02:38:52,140

or just for a few. Um, they have.

2633
02:38:54,299 --> 02:38:57,600
They have. It's just,

2634
02:38:57,601 --> 02:39:00,445
it's a morn. Always worth their risk,

2635
02:39:00,446 --> 02:39:02,853
across the morn. You're different at all, and it's like this,

2636
02:39:02,854 --> 02:39:04,988
you know. Good stuff. Well,

That's not the one I'm just chasing. Jason,

2639
02:39:11,352 --> 02:39:13,745

2641
02:39:17,382 --> 02:39:19,711
on purpose of material.

2642
02:39:19,712 --> 02:39:24,264
Umm, I don't think you remember needing

2643
02:39:24,265 --> 02:39:27,639
to, well, wait a minute, I don't think you should remember.

2644
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:33,248
I love it. It's what's going on with fear. Umm,

2645
02:39:33,259 --> 02:39:35,736
I guess the bloody outside is going to be on Yes.

It's a year old.

2671
02:41:29,064 --> 02:41:35,239
Why is that? That's Well,

2672

2673
02:41:39,017 --> 02:41:41,174

2674
02:41:41,175 --> 02:41:43,433
gonna be in the street. Well,

2675
02:41:43,434 --> 02:41:46,523
the punch he can be helping him get up. But Mr.

2676
02:41:46,524 --> 02:41:48,660
Paul was in the A and that's why I considered it. . .

2677
02:41:58,711 --> 02:42:01,920
Am I just a man boy?

2678
02:42:01,921 --> 02:42:05,903
Forget about this. I don't know what to do with.

2679
02:42:05,904 --> 02:42:08,061
You Yeah, thank you.

2680
02:42:09,318 --> 02:42:11,401

02:42:11,402 --> 02:42:14,731
Heh heh heh. Have a good night.

2682
02:42:14,732 --> 02:42:17,375

Thank you. . 6.

2684

No, no, no. Thank Boosted him to doubt.

2690
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:26,029
The chicken ain't here to get.

2691
02:43:26,030 --> 02:43:44,344
Yeah, that's I

2692
02:43:44,345 --> 02:43:48,885
don't even know what l- We'll you in

2693
02:43:48,886 --> 02:43:52,060
a minute.

2694
02:43:50,093 --> 02:43:53,613
Bye Yeah.

2695
02:43:53,614 --> 02:44:00,800
Yeah. Yeah, we're going kind of against the

2696
02:44:00,801 --> 02:44:05,167
Sam. We're looking at one,

2697
02:44:05,168 --> 02:44:07,584
and we're going to look at 136.

2698
02:44:07,585 --> 02:44:10,024
What's that? Let's see if we have Uuuh,

2699
02:44:10,035 --> 02:44:11,060
with 136. space.

2700
02:44:17,851 --> 02:44:21,783
Was Mark gonna give me even budget points?

2701
02:44:22,730 --> 02:44:27,255
Was Mark gonna give me much jobs? I'm gonna give you

2702
02:44:27,256 --> 02:44:32,469
some of them too or not. I- I almost got a half-boy.

2703
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:37,086
You I don't

2704
02:44:37,087 --> 02:44:39,603
have to worry more about it. I have to be glad that it shows

2705
02:44:39,604 --> 02:44:42,395
that I didn't point it out and I definitely didn't want it to be.

2706
02:44:42,846 --> 02:44:47,545
But it'd be okay be honest, like, it looks

2707
02:44:47,546 --> 02:44:49,928
alright. I bet she's down.

2708
02:44:49,929 --> 02:44:52,891
I bet she's down. Okay, we can get back to my turn.

2709
02:44:52,892 --> 02:44:55,155
. You guys are white at one of us here,

2710
02:44:55,156 --> 02:44:57,509
if you want to daily, go back to the job today.

2711
02:44:57,510 --> 02:44:59,577
We'll see if it comes out. Right?

2712
02:44:59,639 --> 02:45:01,991
You get this out of your belly. Every single job,

2713
02:45:02,254 --> 02:45:05,187
every single release says your file for the reason.

2714
02:45:05,877 --> 02:45:08,479
Yes, we'll get it back in check. Much of it is.

2715
02:45:08,561 --> 02:45:15,122
Yeah. See,

2716
02:45:15,130 --> 02:45:17,371
by the way, the second you have to check out the two variables because-

2717
02:45:17,372 --> 02:45:19,409
I have a feeling that Mark is correct saying,

2718
02:45:19,811 --> 02:45:22,320
ehm, you'll be better, because yeah, they're gonna be changed.

2719
02:45:22,583 --> 02:45:25,160
That's why they came out of exactly the same. It's a reason to modify

2720
02:45:25,192 --> 02:45:28,119
Bye bye. I know, so it's gotta go back up a little. Yeah. Thank

2721
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:33,451

we're building into the masterful servers.

2724
02:45:39,071 --> 02:45:41,491
Right? Yeah. Thank you.

2725
02:45:41,492 --> 02:45:43,280
I'm gonna die. Okay. Thank

2726
02:45:49,531 --> 02:45:52,105

2727
02:45:52,127 --> 02:45:55,442
and just, just shoot. A lot of times,

2728
02:45:55,443 --> 02:45:57,751
it takes a lot of time to do this on this community.

2729
02:45:57,752 --> 02:46:02,751
Thank

2730
02:46:02,968 --> 02:46:06,811

02:47:48,164 --> 02:47:51,426
Now, we'll even just holler there. I'll tune the spice.

2758
02:47:51,469 --> 02:47:54,151
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

2759
02:47:54,152 --> 02:47:54,321
Alright. you

2760
02:48:10,231 --> 02:48:13,078
That's a lot of pink,

2761
02:48:13,079 --> 02:48:17,275
didn't mean to do that. That's a lot of It's a lot of pink.

2762
02:48:17,411 --> 02:48:21,768
It's lot of pink. It's a 75% of pink on me,

2763
02:48:21,769 --> 02:48:24,002
man, everyone. Thanks.

2764
02:48:24,003 --> 02:48:26,311
Thanks.

2765
02:48:26,312 --> 02:48:28,443
It's a 75% of the earth,

2766
02:48:28,444 --> 02:48:31,999
man. It's done, man. Let's go up one,

2767
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,320
aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, good one. Thank .

2768
02:48:34,351 --> 02:48:38,958
Is it because? I don't think anybody runs

2769
02:48:38,959 --> 02:48:42,213
behind me standing fishing, and I think, I mean,

2770
02:48:42,214 --> 02:48:42,991
I understand what you're-

2771
02:48:48,083 --> 02:48:50,971
I don't know what it actually takes, but I get that. Yeah.

2772
02:48:50,972 --> 02:48:54,375
If we, if we had time settings and we knew all of these were

2773
02:48:54,376 --> 02:48:57,418
real, then I would agree with you that you'd be able to want them.

2774
02:48:58,320 --> 02:49:00,683
But, I don't know. I don't know. I don't believe we have the right

2775
02:49:00,684 --> 02:49:03,473
time to check. I agree with you.

2776
02:49:03,919 --> 02:49:06,292
So until we get to the right steps, it is in my opinion not

2777
02:49:06,293 --> 02:49:08,978
to be more likely to know. Yeah, so one of the things I would

2778
02:49:08,979 --> 02:49:12,645
do in a lot of times is, let's say my employees were busy.

2779
02:49:12,833 --> 02:49:14,971
Yeah, I would start at,

2780
02:49:14,972 --> 02:49:19,210
I was having contingency because I knew that other crews were not as fast

2781
02:49:19,211 --> 02:49:23,732
in my age. Yeah, I mean, you know. There's so many ways

2782
02:49:23,733 --> 02:49:27,810
to- It is. Yeah. It's just one of the main twins in the background.

2783
02:49:27,811 --> 02:49:30,150
I think they're actually another one of the kids. Yeah.

2784
02:49:30,151 --> 02:49:30,020
Good.

2785
02:49:41,011 --> 02:49:45,628
I also could keep the

2786
02:49:45,629 --> 02:49:48,368
shot on it on your tire. Uhh,

2787
02:49:48,379 --> 02:49:51,827
simply put it 45 and 50. You're official,

2788
02:49:51,828 --> 02:49:54,999
yeah. Once we've got over 52 hours a week,

2789
02:49:55,293 --> 02:49:57,847
then we're going to drive them off. Then we're going to cover the cones.

2790
02:49:57,848 --> 02:50:02,389
you have to stand around wondering where you're at with your

2791
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:06,031
time. That's the crazy. So that's a pretty,

2792
02:50:06,032 --> 02:50:10,788
It's really, really good. I encourage you guys to go for a three-user

2793
02:50:10,789 --> 02:50:13,537
call. I always work at seven-year-years.

2794
02:50:13,538 --> 02:50:16,675
Cheers. We need to try and push back inches out to the shop program

2795
02:50:16,705 --> 02:50:21,602
you're purchasing, and the shop works in seventy-eight.

2796
02:50:21,603 --> 02:50:23,697
You know, we were always busy,

2797
02:50:23,984 --> 02:50:26,069
always ever coming in, you know,

2798
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:28,944
and there's, I mean,

2799
02:50:29,582 --> 02:50:31,613
that's the- the nurses are warning shopping,

2800
02:50:31,614 --> 02:50:35,773
they work to us supporting the field with anything and everything that they need

2801
02:50:35,774 --> 02:50:38,016
it. Always busy.

2802
02:50:38,017 --> 02:50:40,090
And now it's, I mean,

2803
02:50:40,292 --> 02:50:42,660
it's all changed. It,

2804
02:50:43,481 --> 02:50:47,707
I guess, it doesn't, uhh, it doesn't, uhh. you doesn't support us really as

2805
02:50:47,708 --> 02:50:50,579
much as they used to. Umm,

2806
02:50:50,589 --> 02:50:55,150
most of them are opportunities and you're able to go this week as

2807
02:50:55,151 --> 02:50:57,280
the day or when we get it at all.

2808
02:50:57,563 --> 02:51:00,042
So what are they going to mean? I hear that they want to keep

2809
02:51:00,058 --> 02:51:02,471
our ministers doing what's best to make sure they're waiting.

2810
02:51:02,864 --> 02:51:06,593
Yeah. Wait a minute, are they low? Or are we just chasing along when

2811
02:51:06,594 --> 02:51:09,603
we're working? Umm, that could be,

2812
02:51:09,604 --> 02:51:13,774
that could be- But a lot of the work we're looking at,

2813
02:51:13,881 --> 02:51:17,242
we're, I think, so that's our labor rates,

2814
02:51:17,243 --> 02:51:20,147
too. You cause they're charging big child rates,

2815
02:51:20,148 --> 02:51:23,311
and we don't have big child with it,

2816
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:26,071
and then we end up having to put your own hair.

2817
02:51:26,072 --> 02:51:28,191
We could warm our hair into,

2818
02:51:28,192 --> 02:51:30,294
which is selling things out in heaven,

2819
02:51:30,712 --> 02:51:33,074
and then me trying to get a look off of that in the budget,

2820
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:36,311
and then, And a lot of times I'll detect hours,

2821
02:51:36,312 --> 02:51:38,828
because obviously we want it more efficient,

2822
02:51:38,829 --> 02:51:42,091
so I'll attack that for my later, and,

2823
02:51:42,092 --> 02:51:45,351
reduce my labor hours and take that extra money and put it towards the

2824
02:51:45,352 --> 02:51:48,719
sub-application bucket. They're not always considering that.

2825
02:51:49,164 --> 02:51:52,088
And so, That's where it is sometimes for work.

2826
02:51:52,372 --> 02:51:56,846
And, uhm, but also all of the,

2827
02:51:56,847 --> 02:52:00,785
the back of the- the work that we've gotten this year has been stuff

2828
02:52:00,786 --> 02:52:03,576
that we even want the video. I mean,

2829
02:52:03,577 --> 02:52:07,333
it's a lot of the stuff that we would not get- It's the background

2830
02:52:07,334 --> 02:52:09,447
you've said the estimates about it, you know.

2831
02:52:09,676 --> 02:52:12,742
Part of the thing that we've got is we've been here since,

2832
02:52:13,024 --> 02:52:17,599
before, you've been. I'm the umm, I think they are just

2833
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:22,105
as many as they were, but it's a mixture now because they've got some.

2834
02:52:22,031 --> 02:52:24,720
Some of the guys who are going to structure will do an actual estimates

2835
02:52:25,201 --> 02:52:29,169
because order inevitably become an electrical company because they're so incredible in that.

2836
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:31,314
then of there. And so,

2837
02:52:31,832 --> 02:52:36,441
that, uhm, just feels like they're focused at a completely different

2838
02:52:36,442 --> 02:52:41,007
area and they don't get- snew me in the window because there's

2839
02:52:41,008 --> 02:52:43,214
so much more over there, there's so much more.

2840
02:52:43,722 --> 02:52:45,860
Yeah, that goes into the shot.

2841
02:52:45,861 --> 02:52:48,655
No. No. That's gonna be great. So, and that's,

2842
02:52:49,058 --> 02:52:54,151
thank you. Are we gonna leave the application or-

2843
02:52:54,152 --> 02:52:58,823
ehm. Sound of this land and give the money well for more custom miscellaneous

2844
02:52:58,824 --> 02:53:01,160
work that other trades don't want to do.

2845
02:53:01,674 --> 02:53:06,001
So, like- It's data science. I got tons of miscellaneous in a business.

2846
02:53:06,663 --> 02:53:09,723
We call it more difficult than average miscellaneous. It's not building- We'll see you

2847
02:53:09,724 --> 02:53:11,836
the next thing. Draft games and ladders.

2848
02:53:12,117 --> 02:53:15,778
You know, it's really custom miscellaneous work at other shops.

2849
02:53:15,910 --> 02:53:18,151
They're just afraid to do it. You know.

2850
02:53:18,152 --> 02:53:21,173
Yeah, so the sun picked up the skittest.

2851
02:53:22,149 --> 02:53:24,399
It was 92 skittest. Yeah.

2852
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:28,623
It was $40 million worth of work. It has the other shops.

2853
02:53:29,023 --> 02:53:31,055
Well, there's skitt shops out there now.

2854
02:53:31,177 --> 02:53:35,742
They were full. And some of it never goes- But the

2855
02:53:35,743 --> 02:53:39,256
cave guys that came over there were used to building skits.

2856
02:53:39,261 --> 02:53:44,020
Yeah. So, they went over to the- And all they're

2857
02:53:44,021 --> 02:53:47,904
going to be doing is assembling.

2858
02:53:47,905 --> 02:53:51,096
Cause they're going to- I'm sorry.

2859
02:53:51,097 --> 02:53:52,811
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They're going to have some unique weapons. There's

2860
02:53:52,812 --> 02:53:56,785
just a supply of that part to the assembly. With all our fusion modeling.

2861
02:53:57,137 --> 02:53:59,909
Okay. So, fusion will- I don't know the question.

2862
02:54:00,459 --> 02:54:02,903
They're buying you to get out of us.

2863
02:54:06,021 --> 02:54:08,597
Hmm. We're done? Yeah. Three points. way right . . Way to work.

2864
02:54:08,598 --> 02:54:11,283
Uh.

2865
02:54:16,111 --> 02:54:21,111
thank

2866
02:54:23,648 --> 02:54:26,498
you a lot. Bye bye. Thank you for what?

2867
02:54:26,608 --> 02:54:28,853
We're gonna need to hold the line. Hey guys,

2868
02:54:30,412 --> 02:54:32,925
I think it's easier around my- Thank you. Otherwise,

2869
02:54:32,926 --> 02:54:35,767
it's a mixed message coming up there. I think we need that.

2870
02:54:35,768 --> 02:54:38,536
Yeah. Eh,

2871
02:54:38,702 --> 02:54:43,322
I think we'll be possible. Yeah, I think we're almost instructional starting

2872
02:54:43,323 --> 02:54:45,621
with a kind of tank, stuff like,

2873
02:54:45,746 --> 02:54:48,461
see it, it's gonna like, yeah. Good. I mean,

2874
02:54:48,462 --> 02:54:50,626
I'm not in the short field of miscellaneous stuff,

2875
02:54:50,689 --> 02:54:53,819
you know, that's my favorite tank. That's what I'm telling,

2876
02:54:53,820 --> 02:54:56,220
what I'm kind of saying is, datac- .

2877
02:54:56,221 --> 02:55:00,996
Yeah, and the interesting part of datacenter is

2878
02:55:00,997 --> 02:55:03,102
actually how they're going to give them power.

2879
02:55:03,103 --> 02:55:06,866
Upward. Because you have no power for datacenter,

2880
02:55:06,867 --> 02:55:10,525
it's just going to raise a vision bell. So they're trying to converse up,

2881
02:55:10,586 --> 02:55:15,844
you know, paper tooling and building copper. To stop datacenter

2882
02:55:15,845 --> 02:55:20,371
build out for a year until they figure out how to deal with.

2883
02:55:20,372 --> 02:55:22,434
Chirps, power,

2884
02:55:22,435 --> 02:55:25,297
and water. Cause the whole country is us,

2885
02:55:25,298 --> 02:55:28,037
it's our website. It's on the play,

2886
02:55:28,038 --> 02:55:30,469
I think. Yeah.

2887
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:32,633
Later.

2888
02:55:36,451 --> 02:55:39,628
And so I think that these data-centered people are a realized data,

2889
02:55:39,629 --> 02:55:42,801
but if they don't, you know,

2890
02:55:42,802 --> 02:55:45,242
they can't jack up people's order. And they're getting unpopular,

2891
02:55:45,243 --> 02:55:49,849
right? I don't know if you guys know this through

2892
02:55:49,850 --> 02:55:52,340
power bill. I don't know when I'm 20%.

2893
02:55:52,341 --> 02:55:54,522
17 22 18 18 I'm personally, I guess, uh, old,

2894
02:55:55,327 --> 02:55:59,888
I bought a house that was a brand-father into the solar

2895
02:55:59,889 --> 02:56:03,572
system. Sorry. Oh, there you go. And if I had to re-play,

2896
02:56:03,573 --> 02:56:05,670
I had to re-do all the solar panels because it was so old.

2897
02:56:05,943 --> 02:56:08,580
But because I was a brand-father in, I got to go- .

2898
02:56:08,611 --> 02:56:11,218
So mine haven't got enough. I'm friendly,

2899
02:56:11,219 --> 02:56:13,638
so you can be covered by a life disorder and just be a third

2900
02:56:13,650 --> 02:56:16,240
person, not to speak again. But if you're not honest.

2901
02:56:16,241 --> 02:56:18,805
We'll see you time. Yeah, that is the crew again.

2902
02:56:18,806 --> 02:56:22,334
Twenty percent increase in the number. I don't know,

2903
02:56:22,335 --> 02:56:27,246
I'm not going to change. Let me... But there is no incorporation of commission,

2904
02:56:27,606 --> 02:56:31,776
which regulates that, allowed power companies to increase the raise them up in a

2905
02:56:31,777 --> 02:56:38,931
minute. 3-7-6,

2906
02:56:38,932 --> 02:56:41,613
without addition. Thank you. But I am not,

2907
02:56:41,614 --> 02:56:45,949
not, uh, 3-7, without-7-6.

2908
02:56:45,950 --> 02:56:48,811
Okay. I'm doing it. Yeah. But I think- Thanks.

2909
02:56:49,914 --> 02:56:52,079
We're not there. We're not there. We've got to go after this.

2910
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:54,926
We'll see. Some parts are going in 3-8.

2911
02:56:54,927 --> 02:57:00,325
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2912
02:57:00,326 --> 02:57:02,810
I'm still getting my feet wet.

2913
02:57:02,811 --> 02:57:04,980
Until it says train last week, train this week.

2914
02:57:04,981 --> 02:57:07,670
You have to make the estimates.

2915
02:57:07,671 --> 02:57:10,994
I, I, I, I, I actually thought they were gonna leave their balls this

2916
02:57:10,995 --> 02:57:13,051
week. Did you do it, okay?

2917
02:57:19,629 --> 02:57:21,880
I'm still getting emails. I'll it back.

2918
02:57:21,881 --> 02:57:23,925
I'm so grateful. Yeah, I mean, it's,

2919
02:57:24,370 --> 02:57:26,898
I'm trying to figure those out. I've to figure a couple of them in

2920
02:57:26,899 --> 02:57:28,924
this morning and allow them to determine,

2921
02:57:28,925 --> 02:57:31,403
uh, the programs that, like,

2922
02:57:31,404 --> 02:57:34,386
every day that I have no idea that I've heard of the program I've

2923
02:57:34,387 --> 02:57:36,442
ever used, and so I'm gonna have to learn how to use that,

2924
02:57:36,443 --> 02:57:40,629
I guess. Some of them are not giving you access to it because the

2925
02:57:40,630 --> 02:57:44,720
license cost is too much. Yeah. Like,

2926
02:57:44,721 --> 02:57:48,617
to me, sales for more. You what I would like to solve the opportunities

2927
02:57:48,618 --> 02:57:49,832
we're looking at. Yeah. Sorry.

2928
02:57:55,111 --> 02:57:58,246
There's a small job that's worth looking at that,

2929
02:57:58,247 --> 02:58:00,933
uh, it's probably gonna be one for,

2930
02:58:00,934 --> 02:58:04,111
uh, a nine. I'm sorry.

2931
02:58:04,112 --> 02:58:07,536
And I get to look at the tackle side of the hand that had

2932
02:58:07,537 --> 02:58:11,414
been side of it, cause I'm not really able to advise it if I

2933
02:58:11,415 --> 02:58:14,367
was sitting in on it. Oh, yeah. He's like,

2934
02:58:14,368 --> 02:58:16,820
you know, he's like, man, change is so fast and I can't even keep

2935
02:58:16,821 --> 02:58:20,674
up with him. But he took a few things in the- He's like,

2936
02:58:20,675 --> 02:58:25,932
oh, is that real? Didn't seem like he'd move that

2937
02:58:25,933 --> 02:58:28,111
much stuff out. Oh.

2938
02:58:28,112 --> 02:58:32,392
Yeah,

2939
02:58:32,393 --> 02:58:34,833
I didn't sit there.

2940
02:58:35,613 --> 02:58:38,789
I didn't work here. Thank you. Thank you. Two years and then he went

2941
02:58:38,790 --> 02:58:41,136
out to his office and came back.

2942
02:58:42,780 --> 02:58:44,840
I've been here a long time to see all of the G's.

2943
02:58:44,841 --> 02:58:49,122
Please. He said he could come and go back and forth so he could

2944
02:58:49,123 --> 02:58:55,489
get it from there. All right. Well,

2945
02:58:55,490 --> 02:58:57,915
we did play big too, but the angle and the brush.

2946
02:58:57,916 --> 02:58:59,461
Thank you very

2947
02:59:09,511 --> 02:59:14,265
You're in

2948
02:59:14,492 --> 02:59:17,556
here. Yes, yes. I'm cheering you up.

2949
02:59:21,548 --> 02:59:25,255
Yeah. Oh please, that's all I was thinking. Yeah, I'm sweet. The bad thing

2950
02:59:25,256 --> 02:59:28,530
is, you when you go, they might be evaluated at the site.

2951
02:59:28,932 --> 02:59:31,114
Not right there, we need to bump it up a little bit.

2952
02:59:31,115 --> 02:59:33,199
Hey, I can't even say it again.

2953
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:37,976
I'll say. I'll say I'll be really good

2954
02:59:37,977 --> 02:59:40,612
at adjusting and pushing later. Yeah.

2955
02:59:39,949 --> 02:59:42,588
Yeah. Great. Look what you can type.

2956
02:59:42,589 --> 02:59:44,741
I can say this. Alright. Pup. What you type is.

2957
02:59:45,574 --> 02:59:48,858
Manager advanced application. Manager,

2958
02:59:48,859 --> 02:59:51,225
they're not been answered. It's, it's,

2959
02:59:51,342 --> 02:59:52,310
it's. You

2960
02:59:57,751 --> 03:00:02,751
I

2961
03:00:02,848 --> 03:00:05,034
don't see the plan, you know,

2962
03:00:05,035 --> 03:00:10,834
where to come back. I think

2963
03:00:10,835 --> 03:00:13,836
we'll tell, right? We'll see.

2964
03:00:13,837 --> 03:00:16,027
I don't know what I'd like to do, but I just don't think that's

2965
03:00:16,028 --> 03:00:21,935
where I'm sitting. Get up with I

2966
03:00:21,936 --> 03:00:24,290
understand that it's pretty big, okay?

2967
03:00:24,730 --> 03:00:27,574
Well, we're coming out, and they finally got set up,

2968
03:00:27,854 --> 03:00:29,911
and it's been looking for, uh, a second.

2969
03:00:29,912 --> 03:00:32,193
I'll get to that right in the day tomorrow,

2970
03:00:32,194 --> 03:00:36,799
if you'll do it. Must keep? Yeah. Getting in came

2971
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:40,590
from the Sun in the day. Yeah,

2972
03:00:40,591 --> 03:00:42,882
I tried to do sales force,

2973
03:00:42,883 --> 03:00:45,991
and the sales force was a no. Hello.

2974
03:00:45,992 --> 03:00:49,828
It was a nice camera.

2975
03:00:50,448 --> 03:00:52,707
Chris Keller is not in trouble,

2976
03:00:52,708 --> 03:00:55,882
so he don't. Yeah. You isn't that how to estimate it?

2977
03:00:56,090 --> 03:01:00,150
Oh, okay. They send an email to him and say,

2978
03:01:00,151 --> 03:01:02,251
uh, request to you, Kevin. Okay. That's it. Okay.

2979
03:01:02,252 --> 03:01:07,160
1.14.

2980
03:01:07,161 --> 03:01:11,139
The piece they have left me.

2981
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:13,687
You It's just, it's just here.

2982
03:01:15,031 --> 03:01:17,569
He's not settled, but he used to, in my mind,

2983
03:01:17,570 --> 03:01:20,224
he used to go for it. Alright, see you time. You They're going to

2984
03:01:20,225 --> 03:01:24,734
now. Yeah. You know

2985
03:01:24,735 --> 03:01:27,539
a lot of people here are going to be obviously with some people.

2986
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:30,553
Yeah. Bye-bye. No. So long, that's made of this week.

2987
03:01:30,667 --> 03:01:32,983
Okay. Good. Thank you.

2988
03:01:37,291 --> 03:01:40,593
There's one of the things I tried to figure out.

2989
03:01:40,594 --> 03:01:43,196
I like, who are the real people in the platforms?

2990
03:01:44,745 --> 03:01:46,929
Who's the guy? The information I bought. Yeah.

2991
03:01:46,930 --> 03:01:46,900
Thank you.

2992
03:01:53,311 --> 03:01:58,311
It

2993
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:01,490
just said that, that's the team that asked him a question that came and

2994
03:02:01,491 --> 03:02:03,823
resolved it. Okay. Okay. Well, I, uh, I said,

2995
03:02:03,942 --> 03:02:06,891
if you wait for me, but I, uh, have very much.

2996
03:02:07,106 --> 03:02:10,291
He sat at my desk for, uh, fifteen nights and a thousand.

2997
03:02:10,292 --> 03:02:14,947
Just a bit, just a little bit. Thank

2998
03:02:14,948 --> 03:02:17,560
you.

2999
03:02:34,531 --> 03:02:39,153
And so Jeff sent it to me and

3000
03:02:39,154 --> 03:02:44,241
Jesse Johnson. So Jesse Johnson

3001
03:02:44,729 --> 03:02:47,956
wasn't willing to take care of me. It didn't work, I guess. Oh.

3002
03:02:47,957 --> 03:02:50,611
Now we're going All All right.

3003
03:02:50,612 --> 03:02:53,680
Thank you very much. Thank Okay.

3004
03:03:06,696 --> 03:03:09,178
I'm honestly weak to that thing, so.

3005
03:03:09,514 --> 03:03:13,563
Yeah, that's fine. I swear if you aren't,

3006
03:03:13,564 --> 03:03:14,528
take a little

3007
03:03:22,776 --> 03:03:24,973
I don't know, I don't think this text is even,

3008
03:03:24,974 --> 03:03:26,981
I don't know if it's in there for like a second.

3009
03:03:27,069 --> 03:03:30,672
Yes, Chris, there's more link in the links in the description below.

3010
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:42,369
Uhh, uhh, hm, hm,

3011
03:03:42,370 --> 03:03:46,880
hm.

3012
03:03:46,881 --> 03:03:49,655
. Umm, uhh, hm.

3013
03:03:49,656 --> 03:03:52,690
Umm,

3014
03:03:52,691 --> 03:03:55,725
uhh,

3015
03:03:55,726 --> 03:03:57,873
hmmm,

3016
03:03:57,874 --> 03:03:58,022
hmmm. You

3017
03:04:11,376 --> 03:04:14,146
Like, that is the fashion work that is on women's.

3018
03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:17,049
Yeah. Which is completely different than the dual image.

3019
03:04:17,050 --> 03:04:19,351
Just, uh, and punch it in.

3020
03:04:19,352 --> 03:04:21,370
Check the train,

3021
03:04:21,394 --> 03:04:23,712
you know, without hearing what she'd say about it.

3022
03:04:23,713 --> 03:04:26,937
It might actually, it's pretty on an orphan. It might not have been very

3023
03:04:26,938 --> 03:04:27,396
loud.

3024
03:04:35,371 --> 03:04:37,690
I didn't give them on. Yeah, and it was based on what they used

3025
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:40,148
for us. So yeah, that's so sad. So, uh,

3026
03:04:40,158 --> 03:04:42,521
we just got it. So, no more to the ass. Eh.

3027
03:04:42,744 --> 03:04:44,780
Let's go in. Hey, that's fine. Okay,

3028
03:04:44,781 --> 03:04:47,720
let's, uh, shut up. And also do that.

3029
03:04:47,721 --> 03:04:50,384
Okay. Hey, uh, I don't know how to do it though.

3030
03:04:50,385 --> 03:04:53,825
Thank you. It's pretty fun.

3031
03:04:53,826 --> 03:04:56,766
Yeah man. Please take 10% off, marginalize and badness and sort of thing.

3032
03:04:56,767 --> 03:04:59,040
I'm having a business. Yeah,

3033
03:04:59,041 --> 03:05:04,540
man. Do you know it? I think I should keep not having anything.

3034
03:05:06,507 --> 03:05:08,854
Yeah, that's the song. So that's the instructional period. Modern.

3035
03:05:08,932 --> 03:05:11,082
It's good sense and is well. So,

3036
03:05:11,086 --> 03:05:13,770
you know, if you're not a companion, or if you want to stay inside,

3037
03:05:13,816 --> 03:05:16,208
I'd like to see you soon as day. Bye for today's episode.

3038
03:05:24,391 --> 03:05:26,823
I don't know if anyone people. It's an area. It's part of the food.

3039
03:05:27,302 --> 03:05:28,780
I'm sure still that one is too. Thank you.

3040
03:05:33,211 --> 03:05:37,924
It's something that we want you to

3041
03:05:37,925 --> 03:05:41,371
know. It's a surprise to the guy. Yeah. Okay.

3042
03:05:41,372 --> 03:05:44,223
Like, when you go to the internet, you're going to want me to think

3043
03:05:44,224 --> 03:05:46,180
about it. Or it was kind of stuck with the port, and then I

3044
03:05:46,181 --> 03:05:48,318
hear this in TV. Yeah. So,

3045
03:05:48,319 --> 03:05:51,106
when you go to the sky, it's gonna turn you. So,

3046
03:05:51,107 --> 03:05:54,391
if you're a woman of family, and you guys, that's what it meant to

3047
03:05:54,392 --> 03:05:57,396
be. We have that. So, like, there's no surprise in this picture.

3048
03:05:57,397 --> 03:06:00,179
It's got a little bit structure,

3049
03:06:00,180 --> 03:06:04,338
but it's still on the inside. And then it's wrapped in the moment.

3050
03:06:04,339 --> 03:06:07,418
Scared it. And it's got a thousand. Uhh, uhh, uhh, hmmm,

3051
03:06:07,419 --> 03:06:09,695
hmmm. We are actually,

3052
03:06:10,339 --> 03:06:13,411
it's something I wanted to do. It's a kind of step on It's super.

3053
03:06:13,412 --> 03:06:16,361
If you don't start the Phoenix Convention site,

3054
03:06:16,368 --> 03:06:18,590
you die, I know. It's a bit better. It's about nine.

3055
03:06:18,660 --> 03:06:20,957
It's about nine. Let's see.

3056
03:06:21,177 --> 03:06:23,540
See you. You know, feet are super cool. Mm-hmm.

3057
03:06:23,954 --> 03:06:26,740
Start getting in there. It's a bit better. You know, the custom can block

3058
03:06:26,741 --> 03:06:29,074
the body and shit. It's a bit like, lots of stuff, you see. I'm

3059
03:06:29,148 --> 03:06:32,348
I'm sorry, That wasn't on the space, pulling the knee blades in the side.

3060
03:06:32,906 --> 03:06:35,493
I think so, I'll put it.

3061
03:06:35,494 --> 03:06:37,011
Oh, you can hide it as long as you can. So come see it.

3062
03:06:37,012 --> 03:06:39,847
You it on. Most of the time, we get used to getting ready to

3063
03:06:39,848 --> 03:06:41,911
have on the night site, so we get used to it. We have a

3064
03:06:41,912 --> 03:06:44,054
thousand pallets, so you can take away your business with, like,

3065
03:06:44,055 --> 03:06:46,356
shoving my monster names. put in hands. It's the,

3066
03:06:46,357 --> 03:06:48,737
uhm, and then all the other stuff.

3067
03:06:48,738 --> 03:06:50,772
But I don't think we can deal with them. We're gonna say it's the

3068
03:06:50,773 --> 03:06:52,969
taste that we're almost new to here. Yeah,

3069
03:06:53,029 --> 03:06:55,115
something. That's why I think we can see that.

3070
03:06:55,116 --> 03:06:55,582
That's

3071
03:07:03,451 --> 03:07:07,124
What's better?

3072
03:07:09,087 --> 03:07:11,101
Almost sure I don't. I'm in peace.

3073
03:07:11,102 --> 03:07:14,921
Thanks. I'm a 41 nurse at 32.44,

3074
03:07:14,922 --> 03:07:18,229
I'm trying to be, uh, careful with that for a bit.

3075
03:07:18,230 --> 03:07:20,643
I've been here this time. It sounds like I'm really good at it,

3076
03:07:20,644 --> 03:07:24,036
I guess. I'm sure my bad lane isn't put out there,

3077
03:07:24,037 --> 03:07:28,602
but, uh, yeah. So, uhh, uhh, just cut based

3078
03:07:28,603 --> 03:07:31,167
underneath the belt, almost double.

3079
03:07:32,094 --> 03:07:35,123
Okay, so double. See you in the end.

3080
03:07:35,124 --> 03:07:38,899
Finally. And simply, 15%.

3081
03:07:38,900 --> 03:07:42,496
For gingles, this is our another job that we should run this against.

3082
03:07:42,497 --> 03:07:44,537
It's just like this. People, uh,

3083
03:07:44,548 --> 03:07:47,469
everything you're saying, they're mature. I mean, I know we're working on the scouring

3084
03:07:47,470 --> 03:07:51,079
sides of life. Let's see what we just wanted do. I was just wondering

3085
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:53,221
if I told him that other John did you, uh,

3086
03:07:53,222 --> 03:07:58,441
uh, which one? So he pulls out of the five. He pulled out the

3087
03:07:58,442 --> 03:08:00,557
much larger John. you It's the one that,

3088
03:08:00,558 --> 03:08:02,652
but I still don't do you, but I don't belong to John.

3089
03:08:02,653 --> 03:08:04,661
I forget the thing, it's bad.

3090
03:08:05,773 --> 03:08:09,688
Who was T.S.M.C.M.? There's a lot of KSM's.

3091
03:08:09,689 --> 03:08:16,193
You guys have shit in there. Send these animals at Stop

3092
03:08:16,194 --> 03:08:18,415
all of it, and please prepare me cleanly. Yeah. Okay. So,

3093
03:08:18,416 --> 03:08:24,814
good. So, good. Thank you

3094
03:08:24,815 --> 03:08:27,368
so much. I think you're not. You're getting better at it.

3095
03:08:27,369 --> 03:08:30,551
I have a chart lines and some, so, uhm,

3096
03:08:30,562 --> 03:08:39,760
thank Okay.

3097
03:08:39,761 --> 03:08:41,502
I'll take a at the end of the video. Gee, right? I haven't been

3098
03:08:41,503 --> 03:08:43,688
dropped for the split. It's,

3099
03:08:44,222 --> 03:08:48,396
it's, it's, uhm, it's, uhm, it's, it's.

3100
03:08:48,397 --> 03:08:50,699
I mean, it's, it's. It's like.

3101
03:09:20,551 --> 03:09:22,710
Uh, I'm going to sit with some package.

3102
03:09:23,797 --> 03:09:26,879
Here's one of them in there. Okay.

3103
03:09:27,188 --> 03:09:28,591
Draw one of them in there.

3104
03:09:52,700 --> 03:09:55,366
Umm,

3105
03:09:55,537 --> 03:09:58,543
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

3106
03:10:01,531 --> 03:10:02,974
Umm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm.

3107
03:10:08,533 --> 03:10:11,355
I trust I trust you, I just wanted to keep on a total number

3108
03:10:11,356 --> 03:10:13,470
of other sections.

3109
03:10:13,538 --> 03:10:15,549
There you go. There you go. you go. There go.

3110
03:10:15,905 --> 03:10:18,131
There you go. There go. Thanks.

3111
03:10:18,611 --> 03:10:21,120
You're working on doing the same thing. Still, you're doing the ground test to

3112
03:10:21,121 --> 03:10:23,224
do maximization. You have a very smart job.

3113
03:10:23,288 --> 03:10:28,890
You know, I said, I don't Oh yeah. Well,

3114
03:10:28,891 --> 03:10:33,420
in the

3115
03:10:33,571 --> 03:10:36,005
I, I'm a mock yesterday at the shower yesterday.

3116
03:10:36,367 --> 03:10:39,052
I'm here for the most day and I'm interested to buy it out.

3117
03:10:40,139 --> 03:10:41,556
And then it's just like I know.

3118
03:10:57,571 --> 03:10:59,925
It's like, it's not through ever again. So,

3119
03:10:59,926 --> 03:11:02,597
man, I'm gonna be excited. If we get it,

3120
03:11:02,602 --> 03:11:04,746
then we're excited because it's not that. That's the song in the middle.

3121
03:11:04,747 --> 03:11:06,921
All right. Sorry. You're all Just,

3122
03:11:06,922 --> 03:11:08,979
we ought to have a so-and-out rate price.

3123
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:12,114
If only a billion is the type of a woman. Probably,

3124
03:11:12,115 --> 03:11:15,328
actually, it's related. So, it might be.

3125
03:11:15,329 --> 03:11:17,671
I know, I'll sit and I, I think.

3126
03:11:17,746 --> 03:11:19,930
I just walk in the door,

3127
03:11:19,931 --> 03:11:23,154
right? So, uh, my step. That's That's it. What I wanted to say is

3128
03:11:23,155 --> 03:11:26,700
that you need that,

3129
03:11:26,701 --> 03:11:29,520
uhm, uhh, at some point. and and and Yeah.

3130
03:11:32,249 --> 03:11:34,013
You know, I know you guys look more like that. You're trying to say,

3131
03:11:34,014 --> 03:11:37,197
this is, you know, I have to not do that since I've been.

3132
03:11:38,068 --> 03:11:42,436
So, you're- I met him a little bit,

3133
03:11:42,437 --> 03:11:44,169
even when he was a little bit like, yeah, I was on the end,

3134
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:46,440
and shimmy, because it's only- .

3135
03:11:46,441 --> 03:11:48,725
. I was in charge of the interview team, umm,

3136
03:11:48,736 --> 03:11:52,028
so I met him, and I never met a personator,

3137
03:11:52,029 --> 03:11:54,516
he was, I met him from my original role.

3138
03:11:54,517 --> 03:11:58,149
And he was in charge of the and he was in charge of the

3139
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:02,491
interview team, and he was in charge of interview team.

3140
03:12:02,492 --> 03:12:04,762
And we're saying, you know, he's in my office,

3141
03:12:04,763 --> 03:12:07,054
uh, while I go there and do something like that.

3142
03:12:07,119 --> 03:12:13,639
I'm going to get I really

3143
03:12:13,640 --> 03:12:17,787
have to get it. So it's so easy to get it equal here.

3144
03:12:17,862 --> 03:12:21,151
Mostly because it's basically about all the- uhh,

3145
03:12:21,152 --> 03:12:23,759
uhh, uhh,

3146
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:25,875
uhh, uhh,

3147
03:12:25,876 --> 03:12:43,531
uhh, uhh,

3148
03:12:43,532 --> 03:12:46,337
Umm, the hour is on.

3149
03:12:46,376 --> 03:12:49,120
You're trying to stay in here. I don't even know what you're doing.

3150
03:12:49,895 --> 03:12:52,531
Yes, we walked around here. We're getting more.

3151
03:12:52,532 --> 03:12:54,898
Uhh,

3152
03:12:54,909 --> 03:12:57,873
but what you can do is, if you're driving on a set of penalties,

3153
03:12:57,874 --> 03:13:04,033
you're not going to get hurt. I'm assuming you're- I think

3154
03:13:04,034 --> 03:13:07,128
you guys will get hurt from some of the private habits,

3155
03:13:07,129 --> 03:13:08,551
when you start to do the deals with them. Have a start. but not

3156
03:13:08,552 --> 03:13:10,628
So they didn't do that, and it's, you know,

3157
03:13:10,629 --> 03:13:12,921
it's true. It's not that hard. It's okay to do.

3158
03:13:13,108 --> 03:13:15,822
It's okay. But I think they have it.

3159
03:13:15,823 --> 03:13:18,823
Thank you. they have sho-Ive been available.

3160
03:13:18,824 --> 03:13:20,956
8 of them-I call them my lawyer.

3161
03:13:20,957 --> 03:13:24,571
I don't ever give that to you cause I'm a kid.

3162
03:13:30,143 --> 03:13:31,961
I just don't know what they can do here. They can do here. Yeah,

3163
03:13:31,962 --> 03:13:34,918
I do. Thank you. Thank you. Umm.

3164
03:13:34,929 --> 03:13:37,010
It's the only way to think about it or not.

3165
03:13:37,261 --> 03:13:40,100
Yes, I'm in the middle of helping the field install.

3166
03:13:40,101 --> 03:13:44,613
Oh. Oh. I just got to make the

3167
03:13:44,614 --> 03:13:47,543
new job. They suck it,

3168
03:13:47,544 --> 03:13:50,366
too. Thank you. Job. It's good.

3169
03:13:50,367 --> 03:13:53,335
Oh, no. I'm not going to get it.

3170
03:13:53,907 --> 03:13:56,556
But they want it. They're so,

3171
03:13:55,459 --> 03:13:59,120
So, this dog isn't it?

3172
03:13:59,494 --> 03:14:01,941
If he didn't feel good, it's kind of a pain. Yeah, it's good.

3173
03:14:01,942 --> 03:14:03,962
That's when it is a bit of healing. If you feel out and you

3174
03:14:03,963 --> 03:14:07,142
try to help, it's a pain. Get bothered. That's a long amount of trouble.

3175
03:14:07,143 --> 03:14:11,100
There's something safe to have. Just seem there to be a lot of it.

3176
03:14:11,676 --> 03:14:13,739
You just say. Thank you. Yeah, so I had, again,

3177
03:14:13,844 --> 03:14:18,046
my local time was a poo part, so I was having a little bit

3178
03:14:18,047 --> 03:14:20,456
of this in a while, how many takes have you been coming

3179
03:14:28,580 --> 03:14:31,614
Umm, uhh, uhh, hm,

3180
03:14:36,636 --> 03:14:38,641
I wanted to decide, I mean then,

3181
03:14:39,021 --> 03:14:42,091
but, but instead of further than the structure of this,

3182
03:14:42,092 --> 03:14:44,611
I need to stay. But, I'm into the-

3183
03:14:52,596 --> 03:14:55,713
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3184
03:14:56,272 --> 03:14:58,397
I can't say it except this one. Oh,

3185
03:14:58,398 --> 03:15:00,455
really? That's right. That's all it is.

3186
03:15:00,456 --> 03:15:05,372
Yeah. Alright. Alright. Let's get started to the answer.

3187
03:15:05,373 --> 03:15:08,611
Peace. Oh, chef.

3188
03:15:16,651 --> 03:15:19,906
Okay, let me just rest a little bit.

3189
03:15:19,907 --> 03:15:24,040
I want to listen to myself. In the association. Thanks for joining us.

3190
03:15:24,041 --> 03:15:26,139
We'll see you All right. Thank you. Thank you.

3191
03:15:26,140 --> 03:15:28,249
Thank you. You want that? You're welcome.

3192
03:15:28,903 --> 03:15:31,327
Let me just make a moment of this in touch.

3193
03:15:31,328 --> 03:15:33,621
Yeah. Just give it myself. . . Let's go.

3194
03:15:33,659 --> 03:15:36,655
Thank you. Thank you.

3195
03:15:36,656 --> 03:15:47,762
Thank you. I'm

3196
03:15:47,763 --> 03:15:49,531
gonna take the rest of the way back. Good.

3197
03:16:05,551 --> 03:16:07,945
I don't think things I would have been around. Ah,

3198
03:16:07,946 --> 03:16:10,384
so, there's too many chance to get them to become.

3199
03:16:10,709 --> 03:16:13,591
Alright, that's not how that is to be.

3200
03:16:13,592 --> 03:16:18,060
It's not how catchy Thank you very much for joining us,

3201
03:16:18,061 --> 03:16:21,576
and I will see you in the next video.

3202
03:16:21,577 --> 03:16:23,554
Thank you.

3203
03:16:31,672 --> 03:16:35,130
Okay, that's fine. Okay, so, um,

3204
03:16:35,140 --> 03:16:37,591
how do I say everything?

3205
03:16:37,592 --> 03:16:40,872
It's all good. It's kind of smart. I knew it was the,

3206
03:16:40,873 --> 03:16:42,944
uh, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm,

3207
03:16:42,945 --> 03:16:45,571
uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, It's a bit long.

3208
03:16:45,572 --> 03:16:49,100
The part with the parts is the same as the interior project.

3209
03:16:49,484 --> 03:16:51,675
I figure out if it's a lot of hours, you know, it's a lot

3210
03:16:51,676 --> 03:16:53,868
of good days. And I'll probably do the analogy. He's,

3211
03:16:54,419 --> 03:16:56,557
he's not that's a lot. That's a lot. I mean,

3212
03:16:56,558 --> 03:16:58,639
it's a way of what we're gonna call her to do on the tell.

3213
03:16:58,640 --> 03:17:00,932
Maybe she'll find out if it is. She loves going on. I'm sure.

3214
03:17:01,355 --> 03:17:01,527
Well.

3215
03:17:09,636 --> 03:17:12,707
So,

3216
03:17:12,708 --> 03:17:30,136
alright, so that's what we should Yeah,

3217
03:17:30,137 --> 03:17:34,238
that'll make a difference. I was gonna say that,

3218
03:17:34,239 --> 03:17:37,405
that made a- I'm not- I can't skip the beat but I'm sorry.

3219
03:17:37,406 --> 03:17:40,465
I you know, I shouldn't have listened to that.

3220
03:17:40,466 --> 03:17:41,686
Okay. That. That's it.

3221
03:17:51,091 --> 03:17:55,969
You're

3222
03:17:55,970 --> 03:17:57,974
comparing another one then? Yes.

3223
03:17:57,975 --> 03:18:02,055
All This is one of the bads.

3224
03:18:03,468 --> 03:18:09,404
Okay, good. So

3225
03:18:09,405 --> 03:18:17,167
I am

3226
03:18:17,168 --> 03:18:21,758
adding one of this 69 with

3227
03:18:21,759 --> 03:18:25,415
75. Bye. I felt it was 46 with taking eyes.

3228
03:18:25,416 --> 03:18:27,527
One, five, two,

3229
03:18:27,528 --> 03:18:30,322
three, four, five, eighteen, one, one,

3230
03:18:30,361 --> 03:18:32,378
two, seven, eight, three,

3231
03:18:32,379 --> 03:18:34,996
five, five, four, six, eighteen, one,

3232
03:18:34,997 --> 03:18:39,502
two, one, two, two, one,

3233
03:18:39,713 --> 03:18:41,731
two, one, two, five, five,

3234
03:18:41,899 --> 03:18:43,585
five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five,

3235
03:18:43,586 --> 03:18:47,340
five, five, five, five, five, five, .

3236
03:18:47,371 --> 03:18:49,556
He's following right here in a second. Yeah.

3237
03:18:49,557 --> 03:18:53,299
You're going to get your friend that gets an individual job to take.

3238
03:18:53,769 --> 03:18:57,405
Yeah. He doesn't know how to operate from the job. Uhh,

3239
03:18:57,406 --> 03:18:59,410
uhh,

3240
03:18:59,411 --> 03:19:01,415
uhh,

3241
03:19:01,416 --> 03:19:03,420
uhh,

3242
03:19:03,451 --> 03:19:06,383
uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh,

3243
03:19:06,384 --> 03:19:11,491
uhh, uhh,

3244
03:19:11,492 --> 03:19:15,489
uhhy, uhh, as disciples, but that child gets hurt when you're innocent.

3245
03:19:15,490 --> 03:19:19,083
So, ok, that was,

3246
03:19:19,084 --> 03:19:22,266
uhm, I'm sure. So, with this one, we were providing it with a total

3247
03:19:22,267 --> 03:19:25,987
of honors, and it said, put it right out in the head and come

3248
03:19:25,988 --> 03:19:29,629
in. Oh, ok. Focus. Uh,

3249
03:19:29,639 --> 03:19:31,807
this piece came from here. I think it was,

3250
03:19:31,854 --> 03:19:35,616
yeah, it gave us one last time we set the video out.

3251
03:19:35,617 --> 03:19:37,726
They didn't, you know, get it,

3252
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:40,364
okay. Umm, that's what it did.

3253
03:19:40,365 --> 03:19:42,922
No, it didn't appear. It's, uh,

3254
03:19:42,933 --> 03:19:45,283
what it Umm, yeah, you know, so.

3255
03:19:45,284 --> 03:19:50,199
And this was, I didn't trust

3256
03:19:50,200 --> 03:19:55,040
that, and this is. . This is one Okay.

3257
03:19:57,690 --> 03:19:59,736
Okay.

3258
03:19:59,737 --> 03:20:02,213
Now that the guy who worked here,

3259
03:20:02,526 --> 03:20:04,273
he said, he said to me, he's dead for a little sleep. Alright, Mark

3260
03:20:04,274 --> 03:20:07,420
here. Good! Then go click Hold on.

3261
03:20:07,421 --> 03:20:10,740
All right. If see you I'm guessing we should just find some more because

3262
03:20:10,741 --> 03:20:13,225
without hearing with them all the time, you know, those are the steps of

3263
03:20:13,226 --> 03:20:15,811
Katie, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3264
03:20:15,812 --> 03:20:18,498
So, this one, uhm, uhm,

3265
03:20:18,508 --> 03:20:21,601
pretty much every single one of these packages, a,

3266
03:20:23,851 --> 03:20:28,238
You know, originally made the project at quarter-range process of the order.

3267
03:20:28,559 --> 03:20:31,896
We got the button drawn on the set, and all of the weldments.

3268
03:20:31,897 --> 03:20:34,446
Switch the 560,

3269
03:20:34,447 --> 03:20:36,618
and set it forward. We are up.

3270
03:20:36,920 --> 03:20:39,668
So, with all of the things,

3271
03:20:39,682 --> 03:20:43,063
we're- re-estimated before we spend a month in the floor,

3272
03:20:43,175 --> 03:20:46,377
just out of the seat, to make sure we weren't in a bus,

3273
03:20:46,378 --> 03:20:48,403
to get more in a bus than we were in a- trying to get

3274
03:20:48,404 --> 03:20:51,740
ahead of it and say, here's what it is going to take us,

3275
03:20:51,741 --> 03:20:53,972
and it's over a certain dollar up and you know,

3276
03:20:54,286 --> 03:20:56,949
you you can assess the meeting. I don't have word,

3277
03:20:56,950 --> 03:20:59,338
check capacity, some, some point.

3278
03:20:59,339 --> 03:21:01,969
Um, so that's,

3279
03:21:02,901 --> 03:21:05,044
that was kind of the process. This would cost him a he's,

3280
03:21:05,275 --> 03:21:07,559
we'd get him in out of the way yesterday,

3281
03:21:07,560 --> 03:21:10,120
you know, or they, uh, put out a lot of over,

3282
03:21:10,425 --> 03:21:13,766
and then- and then they don't get married to me.

3283
03:21:14,265 --> 03:21:17,683
So- So the- the mix between your fit,

3284
03:21:17,684 --> 03:21:22,333
the gweld, and other. Bye Is essentially

3285
03:21:22,334 --> 03:21:25,011
what a fit and well is over here, but yeah,

3286
03:21:25,028 --> 03:21:27,312
it depends on what you're under, it should be.

3287
03:21:27,313 --> 03:21:32,769
What about you? You should- Yeah, uhm, but you're essential

3288
03:21:34,396 --> 03:21:40,417
to this. Thank very much. I still have,

3289
03:21:41,356 --> 03:21:44,037
on that lice, I'm going to shoot it before my death.

3290
03:21:44,038 --> 03:21:47,364
that. That is, on that last job, I should have recorded that as well.

3291
03:21:47,365 --> 03:21:50,201
Can we get back to where you do that? Look at that,

3292
03:21:50,202 --> 03:21:52,231
you know, with that I'm sorry,

3293
03:21:52,232 --> 03:21:54,636
I should have, uh,

3294
03:21:54,637 --> 03:21:58,651
grabbed it while we were there.

3295
03:21:58,652 --> 03:22:03,533
That way we- See

3296
03:22:03,534 --> 03:22:08,371
you there.

3297
03:22:12,412 --> 03:22:14,939
Okay.

3298
03:22:24,456 --> 03:22:26,557
No, no, no,

3299
03:22:26,558 --> 03:22:27,300
no, There.

3300
03:22:32,491 --> 03:22:37,123
It sounds like Chris is

3301
03:22:37,124 --> 03:22:40,716
quantifying and tasked with making sure the numbers are right.

3302
03:22:40,717 --> 03:22:42,886
I think, again, it's up here. So, uh,

3303
03:22:42,897 --> 03:22:45,035
you can eventually say,

3304
03:22:45,036 --> 03:22:47,674
yeah, these are good now. Let's push it out a little bit.

3305
03:22:47,675 --> 03:22:52,167
That's it. I like what he said he wants,

3306
03:22:52,197 --> 03:22:54,554
he also wants to be a patch of all balance.

3307
03:22:55,596 --> 03:22:57,691
You and I both agree with it. Thank you.

3308
03:22:57,692 --> 03:23:01,089
Thank you. Very, very good. The whole business has to be on action,

3309
03:23:01,090 --> 03:23:04,494
right? Yeah. I want you mad at it and you can start working.

3310
03:23:05,185 --> 03:23:09,046
Then just- You know, I'll fix it by training by us.

3311
03:23:09,047 --> 03:23:13,455
I'm not a man. Sorry, I had to use this a lot.

3312
03:23:13,456 --> 03:23:17,889
Oh. Okay.

3313
03:23:18,151 --> 03:23:19,940
Okay. Okay.

3314
03:23:29,731 --> 03:23:31,792
Yeah, I want it to,

3315
03:23:31,807 --> 03:23:34,190
okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, and .

3316
03:23:34,191 --> 03:23:36,630
.

3317
03:23:47,731 --> 03:23:52,731
And

3318
03:23:52,898 --> 03:23:55,711
me and that, uh, the efficient.

3319
03:23:55,712 --> 03:24:00,445
I don't think I'm

3320
03:24:00,446 --> 03:24:06,937
feeling it. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. Okay.

3321
03:24:08,001 --> 03:24:10,697
So, you, you have a step out of that that you just showed of

3322
03:24:10,698 --> 03:24:11,731
what the job really-

3323
03:24:17,313 --> 03:24:19,121
This is just a description today. Okay. Yes, this one needs to be the

3324
03:24:19,122 --> 03:24:22,239
biggest. Okay, week. Umm, the last one we were looking at that,

3325
03:24:22,240 --> 03:24:24,602
I can, I can pull up. Ah,

3326
03:24:27,575 --> 03:24:30,308
I can pull up. Alright, so this one,

3327
03:24:30,678 --> 03:24:35,527
two ninety-nine. You're gonna give

3328
03:24:35,528 --> 03:24:37,841
us the actual announcement. relevant. Yeah.

3329
03:24:38,759 --> 03:24:42,197
So, it shoots me up a little bit.

3330
03:24:42,198 --> 03:24:47,347
We'll see and tell us from this one again.

3331
03:24:47,518 --> 03:24:52,340
So, we'll screenshot it. And a second.

3332
03:24:52,341 --> 03:24:57,253
3A2's yet.

3333
03:24:57,616 --> 03:25:00,308
So, yeah, it was, it was crazy.

3334
03:25:00,309 --> 03:25:03,481
Shh, my name. Yeah, we'll get everyone to do that for a reason.

3335
03:25:05,464 --> 03:25:08,983
The other one, I can't understand what we have in the county for all

3336
03:25:08,984 --> 03:25:12,837
of that. I'm thinking both of the top of the lines.

3337
03:25:12,838 --> 03:25:15,144
Okay, so, in v3,

3338
03:25:15,145 --> 03:25:17,145
right now, I have some other lines that we're going to be making.

3339
03:25:17,146 --> 03:25:19,662
in. 3, 3, 20,

3340
03:25:19,663 --> 03:25:24,023
and the, uhm, the, uhm, the original.

3341
03:25:24,024 --> 03:25:29,467
So, it's a nice, nice, So, and then,

3342
03:25:29,468 --> 03:25:31,554
I go back in here,

3343
03:25:32,285 --> 03:25:37,597
and I go. You here,

3344
03:25:37,598 --> 03:25:44,944
here, And,

3345
03:25:44,945 --> 03:25:47,432
in use,

3346
03:25:47,649 --> 03:25:49,857
in the hero. That's,

3347
03:25:49,873 --> 03:25:52,296
that's what we've got a lot more on the other speeds that she's in

3348
03:25:52,297 --> 03:25:55,373
for the rest of the game. It's actually fun now,

3349
03:25:55,374 --> 03:25:57,511
actually. What's that?

3350
03:25:57,512 --> 03:25:59,780
I think they're following.

3351
03:26:00,104 --> 03:26:03,669
Yeah, they're starting to try and I think they're using heavy vid.

3352
03:26:03,670 --> 03:26:07,995
Thank you. This is pure speculation that it's gone.

3353
03:26:08,299 --> 03:26:10,792
Because I don't know what you've ever been for ever to get shot and

3354
03:26:10,793 --> 03:26:13,591
to get. One that's what I'm curious about is,

3355
03:26:13,516 --> 03:26:16,582
Is the, uh, low field shot? Because it's such a mechanical shot.

3356
03:26:16,583 --> 03:26:20,878
Yeah. That, I'd be surprised if they don't have a pipe made package.

3357
03:26:21,050 --> 03:26:25,835
That's just- So, unless it's very finished with

3358
03:26:25,963 --> 03:26:32,027
actions. Thanks for your patience. Totally

3359
03:26:32,028 --> 03:26:37,825
finished 10. Just under 10 hours under the original.

3360
03:26:37,826 --> 03:26:40,656
It's 299. Umm,

3361
03:26:40,667 --> 03:26:43,370
well, we used 86. I guess it is.

3362
03:26:43,371 --> 03:26:45,840
and we'll see you

3363
03:26:53,851 --> 03:26:58,528
For sure it's gonna be mine.

3364
03:26:58,529 --> 03:27:02,791
Uh.

3365
03:27:02,792 --> 03:27:06,317
I'll put it just in the stairs,

3366
03:27:06,846 --> 03:27:11,257
and we had an inch, and put it in the- Umm,

3367
03:27:11,267 --> 03:27:14,853
ehm, ehm, ehm,

3368
03:27:14,854 --> 03:27:20,667
ehm. I'm I'm going to be sitting on a

3369
03:27:20,668 --> 03:27:24,470
71.75 instead of an eight.

3370
03:27:24,956 --> 03:27:27,047
Looks perfect to confess. Yes. Umm, ehm,

3371
03:27:27,048 --> 03:27:29,536
ehm, ehm,

3372
03:27:29,537 --> 03:27:32,264
ehm. 5, 6,

3373
03:27:32,265 --> 03:27:39,130
7. We need 7.7.7.5.

3374
03:27:39,131 --> 03:27:39,460
So. Okay.

3375
03:27:58,720 --> 03:28:02,389
. If I look that up, I'll be looking at the,

3376
03:28:02,390 --> 03:28:04,802
uhh, the part of the agency that, the beginning of the video.

3377
03:28:04,803 --> 03:28:06,811
I'm if you're interested in that. There.

3378
03:28:06,812 --> 03:28:09,117
You're feeding strongly into it.

3379
03:28:10,039 --> 03:28:12,515
I think that low, low,

3380
03:28:12,516 --> 03:28:14,851
low, then long. Love.

3381
03:28:14,852 --> 03:28:17,100
You know stuff? Yeah. I mean,

3382
03:28:17,236 --> 03:28:20,609
I don't have the history yet, but I'm not working on getting it.

3383
03:28:20,610 --> 03:28:24,606
Okay Yes,

3384
03:28:24,607 --> 03:28:29,346
I think Power Fair Techno is going to be everything that's structural

3385
03:28:29,347 --> 03:28:33,116
that just drives and. . . You know, that electrical that you're talking about.

3386
03:28:33,117 --> 03:28:36,864
. . You know, that That's it. . . What we're Oh,

3387
03:28:36,865 --> 03:28:41,029
it's the money! What's your actual on the .

3388
03:28:41,030 --> 03:28:44,499
. . 25 0 6 0 9 48?

3389
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:46,831
You have that.

3390
03:28:46,832 --> 03:28:51,831
That's

3391
03:28:52,280 --> 03:28:55,831
the person. Uhm, that's the second one.

3392
03:28:55,832 --> 03:28:58,707
The more we hear that, the more we hear. This one,

3393
03:28:58,708 --> 03:29:01,600
uhm, this one was just ready for the production today.

3394
03:29:01,601 --> 03:29:06,053
Okay. Okay. See you later. See you later. later. I'm going a good Yeah.

3395
03:29:06,054 --> 03:29:08,204
Okay, I'm Dave.

3396
03:29:08,205 --> 03:29:10,720
Umm, Ehm, Ehm, Ehm, Ehm, Ehm, Ehm, Ehm,

3397
03:29:10,721 --> 03:29:12,788
Ehm, Ehm, Ehm. . . Yeah. Yeah,

3398
03:29:12,789 --> 03:29:15,339
I'm gonna see what we got. Or dude,

3399
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:17,406
40, whatever hit it,

3400
03:29:17,940 --> 03:30:41,330
the more the better. Later. 7-4-8-4-8,

3401
03:30:41,331 --> 03:30:42,135
correct? Thank you much.

3402
03:31:14,911 --> 03:31:18,077
And, uh,

3403
03:31:18,088 --> 03:31:21,420
techless outwards are total of 58.

3404
03:31:21,421 --> 03:31:25,306
8. Budget be in 69.

3405
03:31:25,307 --> 03:31:26,000
Uhm. and

3406
03:31:31,171 --> 03:31:35,729
We're kind of going all over here.

3407
03:31:35,730 --> 03:31:42,506
You No,

3408
03:31:42,527 --> 03:31:45,331
they're not, uhm, uhm, as an example,

3409
03:31:45,332 --> 03:31:50,034
on the 2407 5-8. Alright, we'll see you fit up and will are

3410
03:31:50,035 --> 03:31:54,251
basically right between tech on the budget.

3411
03:31:54,252 --> 03:31:57,263
it. Umm,

3412
03:31:57,274 --> 03:32:00,140
the last one looked at 25060948.

3413
03:32:00,141 --> 03:32:06,672
or eight. It's

3414
03:32:06,673 --> 03:32:09,067
pretty close between fit up and the wheel.

3415
03:32:09,068 --> 03:32:13,455
Um, it's- There's a little slight difference.

3416
03:32:14,308 --> 03:32:19,320
The, uh, uhm, 2-5 this one is- there's a 48%

3417
03:32:19,321 --> 03:32:23,868
d- difference between way old and a 20% difference between fit

3418
03:32:23,869 --> 03:32:27,168
up. And if we look at handling cut.

3419
03:32:27,169 --> 03:32:30,991
That's it. Burn. So just handling.

3420
03:32:30,992 --> 03:32:34,382
One job is 8.78, um,

3421
03:32:34,392 --> 03:32:39,484
high in tech. there. 30% low on the next job in tech.

3422
03:32:39,485 --> 03:32:42,161
20% high on this job.

3423
03:32:42,736 --> 03:32:48,758
Thank you very much. Yeah, I think that was 30%

3424
03:32:48,759 --> 03:32:51,440
high. I'm the first one, 53%.

3425
03:32:51,571 --> 03:32:55,465
Low on the second one, 112% high on the next one.

3426
03:32:56,292 --> 03:32:59,480
Burn is 34%.

3427
03:32:59,481 --> 03:33:03,007
Thank for your attention. I am lying on the 1st one, 1% high on

3428
03:33:03,008 --> 03:33:07,784
the 2nd one, It's

3429
03:33:07,785 --> 03:33:12,225
all the same families of jobs, we'd be basically making people with live plates

3430
03:33:12,226 --> 03:33:15,179
here, they have different types of jobs. Umm,

3431
03:33:15,189 --> 03:33:17,617
this one. And the first one, the area is the one,

3432
03:33:17,624 --> 03:33:19,737
the both of them. It's kinda like the first one we're lacking.

3433
03:33:19,738 --> 03:33:22,938
I'm gonna be in a middle room. Alright.

3434
03:33:23,489 --> 03:33:25,810
Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. That's, uh, um,

3435
03:33:25,821 --> 03:33:28,508
the sixth one when we did it in the middle. Uh,

3436
03:33:28,518 --> 03:33:31,771
that one, when we did it in actuals is,

3437
03:33:31,772 --> 03:33:35,609
a mixture with a lot of structural,

3438
03:33:35,610 --> 03:33:37,646
as well as sinusilius,

3439
03:33:37,647 --> 03:33:39,811
so it's got angles, cusset, please. Please.

3440
03:33:39,812 --> 03:33:42,675
Umm, a bunch of little stuff,

3441
03:33:42,949 --> 03:33:47,340
and this is mostly 80-odd.

3442
03:33:47,341 --> 03:33:51,412
All right. Yeah, cause I'd say, by the line, if you start mixing hand

3443
03:33:51,413 --> 03:33:54,415
rail with music columns, it's a good one.

3444
03:33:54,690 --> 03:33:56,888
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then,

3445
03:33:56,889 --> 03:33:59,580
and some of these are pretty small. I'm just going to see it a

3446
03:33:59,581 --> 03:34:01,926
little bit of, uh, while I'm around. Uhm.

3447
03:34:01,927 --> 03:34:05,658
Yeah. See you I'm going to see if it's in jail to cut it

3448
03:34:05,659 --> 03:34:08,100
under and learn it more. Yeah.

3449
03:34:08,101 --> 03:34:10,627
Uhm,

3450
03:34:10,638 --> 03:34:14,159
in the hater, it's good. . You can see,

3451
03:34:14,730 --> 03:34:18,806
we can keep it on the same scale of the 758 project.

3452
03:34:18,807 --> 03:34:23,652
Umm. Come on. Which is structural and

3453
03:34:23,653 --> 03:34:31,024
a small amount of misleading is in one package of 7.5.5 1,1,2,4.

3454
03:34:31,025 --> 03:34:33,052
Let's see.

3455
03:34:44,131 --> 03:34:46,151
I was like, oh, he changed his life,

3456
03:34:46,152 --> 03:34:49,665
yes. Yeah. The only thing I saw that I was looking just for that

3457
03:34:49,666 --> 03:34:52,069
was we were low on burners. Yeah.

3458
03:34:52,070 --> 03:34:54,879
Yep. On, uh,

3459
03:34:54,890 --> 03:34:59,848
yeah, let's say short that middle job was about.

3460
03:34:59,849 --> 03:35:03,867
Bye-bye. The same, but there's a little round to the lid.

3461
03:35:04,029 --> 03:35:06,981
You know, you can't really use that.

3462
03:35:07,271 --> 03:35:07,611
Mm-hmm.

3463
03:35:16,291 --> 03:35:21,566
And, you know, I-I know, I-I-I-I get us

3464
03:35:22,179 --> 03:35:24,245
experiencing-

3465
03:35:32,371 --> 03:35:34,754
I didn't consist of it, whereas, you know,

3466
03:35:34,755 --> 03:35:38,795
people flip the wrongs and get a general period,

3467
03:35:38,796 --> 03:35:43,730
right? And so- I'll go with- if- if-

3468
03:35:43,731 --> 03:35:46,761
if I see some slight variation there,

3469
03:35:46,762 --> 03:35:49,299
then it is because of his- Yeah,

3470
03:35:49,300 --> 03:35:51,559
of course. There you go.

3471
03:35:51,560 --> 03:35:54,491
The way, I shouldn't say that the way wind blows is,

3472
03:35:54,492 --> 03:35:57,249
I don't know what's going on in that, but he's not looking at You

3473
03:35:57,250 --> 03:35:59,366
can take it back with a grain of salt.

3474
03:36:00,190 --> 03:36:03,219
Yeah. I mean, I want it. Strike it down.

3475
03:36:03,220 --> 03:36:05,596
Okay. Well, you tell me,

3476
03:36:05,597 --> 03:36:08,656
but a lot of structure is either the dog or pallet belt or tongue.

3477
03:36:08,657 --> 03:36:11,141
A lot of people feel like a pet.

3478
03:36:11,142 --> 03:36:13,683
Good, I don't know, I don't like it,

3479
03:36:13,684 --> 03:36:16,277
but they do. To me, it's like,

3480
03:36:16,278 --> 03:36:19,213
you start out with the hours you think it's really gonna take,

3481
03:36:19,214 --> 03:36:21,626
and it costs them to hurt. And then, And then you look at it

3482
03:36:21,627 --> 03:36:25,909
and say, oh, okay, about how much money I get for a ton of

3483
03:36:25,910 --> 03:36:28,828
compounds. Why is this fun hiring?

3484
03:36:28,829 --> 03:36:34,084
better. I use 30 pounds per

3485
03:36:34,085 --> 03:36:36,540
minute.

3486
03:36:36,541 --> 03:36:39,213
Yeah, I'm working. I've heard what I would call our standard working.

3487
03:36:39,286 --> 03:36:42,271
Yeah. And I'll do the same thing. I'll slide it. Okay.

3488
03:36:43,292 --> 03:36:45,580
Let's just begin the moment here. Yeah. So,

3489
03:36:45,897 --> 03:36:48,427
like, if you see, I don't have to bring that to a minute.

3490
03:36:48,574 --> 03:36:51,107
This is great. Yeah,

3491
03:36:51,108 --> 03:36:55,871
what it is. It's, But that doesn't

3492
03:36:55,872 --> 03:36:59,044
work for instruction. It works for gopting shoots,

3493
03:36:59,081 --> 03:37:06,416
authors. We'll see that

3494
03:37:06,417 --> 03:37:10,611
other few gets used a lot, so that's kinda gonna bug in this.

3495
03:37:10,612 --> 03:37:15,588
Yes, sir. I'm real. So

3496
03:37:18,568 --> 03:37:21,857
that's a theatre. Well, the hours on this job.

3497
03:37:22,767 --> 03:37:25,541
Yeah, nope. Thanks for having us.

3498
03:37:36,991 --> 03:37:41,737
When

3499
03:37:42,683 --> 03:37:44,726
I was 16, well, I went 3, 5,

3500
03:37:44,727 --> 03:37:46,778
6, 8. So then,

3501
03:37:46,779 --> 03:37:50,839
I took the point 6,

3502
03:37:50,840 --> 03:37:54,237
and, You And then they say,

3503
03:37:54,238 --> 03:37:58,950
oops, that doesn't jime. Is it's

3504
03:37:58,951 --> 03:38:01,056
changed? Is it white?

3505
03:38:02,920 --> 03:38:05,056
It looks like it ought to be in fit up because,

3506
03:38:06,006 --> 03:38:08,333
well, on this job,

3507
03:38:08,334 --> 03:38:13,871
Techler was. was. higher on by 38%

3508
03:38:13,872 --> 03:38:17,071
and the fit up was. a little bit work.

3509
03:38:17,072 --> 03:38:21,582
way under. Probably because using the name and doing the

3510
03:38:21,636 --> 03:38:23,873
manual manipulation down there, you don't get fit up.

3511
03:38:24,289 --> 03:38:26,757
Yes, uh. So, I would bet that goes in.

3512
03:38:27,041 --> 03:38:29,419
In fact, I won't put it in there. Uh,

3513
03:38:29,430 --> 03:38:31,520
and the other part is it's, it's awesome. I,

3514
03:38:31,559 --> 03:38:34,689
because it's weird. Just in a well rate,

3515
03:38:35,296 --> 03:38:37,334
and I calculated these wells.

3516
03:38:37,770 --> 03:38:40,980
But essentially, this one's 5-16 well.

3517
03:38:40,981 --> 03:38:43,441
Hello. Which is now .6,

3518
03:38:43,442 --> 03:38:47,160
whereas of all of it.

3519
03:38:47,161 --> 03:38:52,064
You It was .1.2.

3520
03:38:52,065 --> 03:38:55,698
Okay. And so now is the piece.

3521
03:38:55,945 --> 03:38:58,786
All these 1.2. You know, 0.6.

3522
03:38:58,787 --> 03:39:02,647
And either of them are actually cut. Either of them or the other kind

3523
03:39:02,648 --> 03:39:04,940
of. Yeah, that's 1.2.

3524
03:39:04,941 --> 03:39:07,223
we'll hear. All right, thank you for peace falls into the other hand.

3525
03:39:07,224 --> 03:39:10,073
Okay. It's essentially why I was estimated for the exhibit and they gave me

3526
03:39:10,084 --> 03:39:13,051
an amen. I didn't need assessment to, uh. I'm sorry,

3527
03:39:13,052 --> 03:39:16,202
but I always ride on and calculate all the AP6s.

3528
03:39:16,203 --> 03:39:18,973
It's the sound which I need time based upon tablet.

3529
03:39:19,199 --> 03:39:23,627
Now I can go in here and globally edit. yeah That's a little bit

3530
03:39:23,999 --> 03:39:29,002
more action. A little bit more

3531
03:39:29,003 --> 03:39:31,441
action. You But because it's polished to the piece,

3532
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:34,082
are the metrics that we've changed. Yeah,

3533
03:39:34,083 --> 03:39:41,557
I've changed that. I've been. Okay. Uhm.

3534
03:39:41,568 --> 03:39:47,777
So I just don't think it's skewed. The other categories and skewed with He's

3535
03:39:47,778 --> 03:39:49,955
sure. There is.

3536
03:39:49,956 --> 03:39:54,732
Thanks. Really

3537
03:39:54,733 --> 03:39:57,014
zero patterns. Yeah.

3538
03:39:57,535 --> 03:40:00,596
So, like, burn on this one was pretty close.

3539
03:40:00,597 --> 03:40:04,978
I mean, right, um. Thank you I was 18.69 versus 18,

3540
03:40:04,979 --> 03:40:07,272
whereas burn on the others,

3541
03:40:07,729 --> 03:40:09,751
one was 28% under. here.

3542
03:40:09,752 --> 03:40:12,065
1% over 34% under.

3543
03:40:12,066 --> 03:40:13,717
Um

3544
03:40:17,791 --> 03:40:20,819
There is no pattern whatsoever.

3545
03:40:20,820 --> 03:40:22,180
Umm. Oh.

3546
03:40:33,871 --> 03:40:36,584
I mean,

3547
03:40:36,585 --> 03:40:39,890
I think it's gonna be, I mean,

3548
03:40:39,891 --> 03:40:41,911
the word hundreds.

3549
03:40:41,912 --> 03:40:45,927
I think it's also gonna be the hundreds. Who wants driven by Mark,

3550
03:40:46,083 --> 03:40:48,991
the one who's driven by Gilbert, because if you start mixing those,

3551
03:40:48,992 --> 03:40:51,926
you're gonna have the left. I don't know.

3552
03:40:52,518 --> 03:40:55,037
Yeah. Yeah. I think you're,

3553
03:40:55,038 --> 03:40:57,687
you're, well, at all of these it's concerning mirrors.

3554
03:40:57,688 --> 03:40:59,720
Cheers. You're, you're, you're,

3555
03:40:59,929 --> 03:41:02,288
you're not listening. But it's really the actual,

3556
03:41:02,289 --> 03:41:05,066
right? The actual should still be the actual, be the actual.

3557
03:41:05,067 --> 03:41:07,153
We going to Well, now let's go back. All this, you know,

3558
03:41:07,434 --> 03:41:09,658
the actual one, two, four, six, about eight.

3559
03:41:09,874 --> 03:41:12,862
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to sit there so that the

3560
03:41:12,863 --> 03:41:15,410
actual was getting that. And then 566,

3561
03:41:15,411 --> 03:41:17,628
that's the baby chart, you're charting it yourself.

3562
03:41:17,629 --> 03:41:20,093
Yeah. Okay. You guys have a good job.

3563
03:41:20,463 --> 03:41:24,890
Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah. And the 566 was supplied by Gilbert.

3564
03:41:25,556 --> 03:41:30,151
So, we were held to their dollar amount to be supplied by that breakout.

3565
03:41:30,152 --> 03:41:33,691
I estimated that after, just so that we could see if we would,

3566
03:41:33,692 --> 03:41:35,749
uh, us a little over one and a half. How to do? You know,

3567
03:41:36,154 --> 03:41:38,191
I guess. We'll make I'm to do Bye for now.

3568
03:41:38,192 --> 03:41:40,403
I've got to see you in a second.

3569
03:41:40,404 --> 03:41:43,448
Yeah? Historic me and guess we're around f******,

3570
03:41:43,449 --> 03:41:48,448
Hey,

3571
03:41:57,695 --> 03:42:02,316
what? Do you know what you're saying?

3572
03:42:02,317 --> 03:42:02,600
. . Just Okay.

3573
03:42:10,351 --> 03:42:15,261
Yes sir. I want to thank you for I don't want to be

3574
03:42:15,262 --> 03:42:19,873
a person. I just want this,

3575
03:42:19,874 --> 03:42:20,971
you

3576
03:42:26,431 --> 03:42:30,791
I mean,

3577
03:42:30,792 --> 03:42:35,088
I have a little nature that-

3578
03:42:43,116 --> 03:42:45,889
Yes,

3579
03:42:45,890 --> 03:42:49,306
sir. Yeah, I really think it started on. Then I'll get me ahead on

3580
03:42:49,307 --> 03:42:55,318
my nothing procuring. All right. So,

3581
03:42:55,392 --> 03:42:55,946
okay. Alright.

3582
03:43:00,091 --> 03:43:03,119
Yeah,

3583
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:05,412
so that particular line is what we're talking about.

3584
03:43:08,131 --> 03:43:12,022
Two,

3585
03:43:13,111 --> 03:43:16,906
but then we have, One,

3586
03:43:16,907 --> 03:43:19,218
the, uhm, it's nice and confusing.

3587
03:43:19,219 --> 03:43:22,579
Uh, and then we go in here,

3588
03:43:22,580 --> 03:43:27,794
see if it's 3.1. One. And I'll see if it's 3.9.

3589
03:43:27,795 --> 03:43:30,324
Two. So I guess,

3590
03:43:31,188 --> 03:43:33,890
this is all the- I mean,

3591
03:43:33,891 --> 03:43:36,899
well, it's 2.35.

3592
03:43:36,900 --> 03:43:41,561
Bye. . That's not the document,

3593
03:43:41,562 --> 03:43:46,023
it's uh, handling is zero, but we only have any six plan honestly.

3594
03:43:46,667 --> 03:43:49,531
Thanks for being with us. It's something hard to do with that.

3595
03:43:50,449 --> 03:43:53,786
Let him go explore for some of the projects that it was.

3596
03:43:53,787 --> 03:43:58,132
sentence, please. So,

3597
03:43:58,133 --> 03:44:00,467
I think I can, uhm,

3598
03:44:00,478 --> 03:44:05,841
just production people still. So,

3599
03:44:05,842 --> 03:44:09,326
that. That's five minutes,

3600
03:44:09,327 --> 03:44:12,831
moving to base point. She lives plus number five.

3601
03:44:12,832 --> 03:44:16,775
Bye bye. Let's see,

3602
03:44:16,776 --> 03:44:20,474
if you want to help,

3603
03:44:20,573 --> 03:44:23,538
I don't know this. Anytime Umm, 13,

3604
03:44:23,539 --> 03:44:25,632
5, 6, 3,

3605
03:44:25,633 --> 03:44:29,538
17. So, if there's one bigger child,

3606
03:44:29,539 --> 03:44:33,263
then where's your- I think I've ever tasted this one baby bad.

3607
03:44:33,266 --> 03:44:38,388
That's what I'm going to do. You I

3608
03:44:38,389 --> 03:44:41,859
mean, there's so much data here. I mean, I see 600,

3609
03:44:41,860 --> 03:44:45,246
370, 1800.

3610
03:44:45,247 --> 03:44:51,162
There's a lot of data. I don't here.

3611
03:44:51,163 --> 03:44:54,151
No. It'd be nice to have a little chicken.

3612
03:44:54,152 --> 03:44:56,617
Dop it off. In one,

3613
03:44:57,069 --> 03:44:59,760
I'll swoop into itself. Well. Yeah.

3614
03:45:10,231 --> 03:45:12,758
Like,

3615
03:45:12,968 --> 03:45:15,970
those logic numbers don't match well.

3616
03:45:15,971 --> 03:45:20,645
So, I don't want to hear

3617
03:45:20,646 --> 03:45:23,465
it either.

3618
03:45:23,487 --> 03:45:32,812
Who's the Justin's signify? the file. Umm.

3619
03:45:32,822 --> 03:45:34,788
Well, they're shaded out of the day, it was like a sassy thing. Let's

3620
03:45:34,789 --> 03:45:37,370
see the worst. Okay. That's what I'm saying.

3621
03:45:37,371 --> 03:45:39,541
It doesn't match this, but then there's,

3622
03:45:40,648 --> 03:45:43,096
I mean, I think three missing base adjustments.

3623
03:45:43,097 --> 03:45:46,700
Justin. The plan, right there. Yeah,

3624
03:45:46,701 --> 03:45:50,691
see, there's actually an, uhm, an estimated hours.

3625
03:45:49,915 --> 03:45:52,224
hours. People go as well,

3626
03:45:52,225 --> 03:45:55,718
but playing in this, that's where I was expecting to see this one.

3627
03:45:56,364 --> 03:45:58,920
But they were sending, they were using the adjustment of the estimated.

3628
03:45:58,921 --> 03:46:03,649
That's about it. So a plant is the sum of adjustment plus base.

3629
03:46:03,650 --> 03:46:07,531
Yep. Bye-bye.

3630
03:46:07,532 --> 03:46:09,781
Time's right machine,

3631
03:46:09,802 --> 03:46:14,440
so I'm just sitting here in the middle. I'm gonna associate that before.

3632
03:46:14,782 --> 03:46:15,325
It's dead.

3633
03:46:40,231 --> 03:46:43,673
Okay.

3634
03:47:22,291 --> 03:47:27,057
I'm going for an all the story to- is it a shuttle?

3635
03:47:27,058 --> 03:47:32,320
You're not gonna- Good. If

3636
03:47:32,321 --> 03:47:32,850
that Okay.

3637
03:47:39,991 --> 03:47:44,991
Subscribe,

3638
03:47:46,351 --> 03:47:49,658
send us an e-mail and be like. I can send a spreadsheet and say,

3639
03:47:49,730 --> 03:47:53,133
here it is. I would assume that technology may come before.

3640
03:47:53,134 --> 03:47:57,048
Well, thanks God. Bye I'm even working.

3641
03:47:57,365 --> 03:47:59,680
Let's go out! Lay down some clothes.

3642
03:47:59,681 --> 03:48:04,111
Django. I'm still in that typing!

3643
03:48:04,112 --> 03:48:06,489
And every week, you know,

3644
03:48:06,490 --> 03:48:10,919
just having that as a report, custom in person's actual phone.

3645
03:48:10,920 --> 03:48:13,036
Well done. A bunch of tries.

3646
03:48:13,037 --> 03:48:18,036
It's,

3647
03:48:31,749 --> 03:48:33,381
uh, time shoot. It's-

3648
03:49:08,431 --> 03:49:13,431
I

3649
03:49:14,786 --> 03:49:19,423
don't know where all of them let you not even say she- Umm,

3650
03:49:19,433 --> 03:49:21,815
ehm, ehm,

3651
03:49:21,816 --> 03:49:24,735
ehm, ehm, ehm,

3652
03:49:24,736 --> 03:49:29,558
ehm, ehm. You know. I'm also,

3653
03:49:29,559 --> 03:49:33,000
uh, these, they said, uh, me and one sheep. It's the same.

3654
03:49:33,001 --> 03:49:35,247
Yeah. We'll finish. We feel that we constantly,

3655
03:49:35,271 --> 03:49:38,390
we're just keeping things new and age student.

3656
03:49:39,309 --> 03:49:41,257
So each of those good jobs are on the bottom.

3657
03:49:49,356 --> 03:49:51,971
Alright.

3658
03:49:52,339 --> 03:49:58,962
So. The

3659
03:49:58,963 --> 03:50:02,585
person is literally like on your, your computer.

3660
03:50:02,586 --> 03:50:05,367
No, this lives in Mars.

3661
03:50:05,866 --> 03:50:08,723
All the- In the art, that, and shop.

3662
03:50:08,724 --> 03:50:08,580
Uh-huh.

3663
03:50:14,371 --> 03:50:16,882
This is the way he does this cute thing,

3664
03:50:16,883 --> 03:50:19,813
and it's, uh, I put a spicy thing in here.

3665
03:50:20,391 --> 03:50:22,411
Yes. That's it.

3666
03:50:22,412 --> 03:50:27,411
I'm

3667
03:50:28,117 --> 03:50:31,356
used to have Fred Dutton doing this.

3668
03:50:31,357 --> 03:50:34,823
. . Of course, and tweet. Think of the 12 reports,

3669
03:50:35,780 --> 03:50:39,300
of time, and then it goes through them with you and Shane.

3670
03:50:39,301 --> 03:50:43,991
Okay. And then he stopped or came here and went

3671
03:50:44,389 --> 03:50:47,376
for it to keep our time connected.

3672
03:50:47,377 --> 03:50:50,804
He didn't stop.

3673
03:50:52,599 --> 03:50:55,356
My chance of the time. It's,

3674
03:50:55,357 --> 03:50:57,558
So, uh,

3675
03:50:57,569 --> 03:51:00,778
I think it's a good but I'm really good,

3676
03:51:00,779 --> 03:51:02,863
so I think it's a good shot.

3677
03:51:02,864 --> 03:51:03,402
Alright.

3678
03:51:20,371 --> 03:51:23,967
So much.

3679
03:51:23,968 --> 03:51:24,053
Thank you

3680

3681
03:51:31,696 --> 03:51:33,865
140 South Douglas.

3682
03:51:33,866 --> 03:51:34,120

3683
03:51:48,266 --> 03:51:50,041
Uhh, uhh, uhh, You

I'm fat, so, uhm,

3686
03:52:08,840 --> 03:52:17,371

3687
03:52:17,372 --> 03:52:09,280
.

3688
03:52:17,371 --> 03:52:20,100
It's being loved as, if you've seen it,

3689
03:52:20,205 --> 03:52:22,455
watch any of Parafabs videos,

3690
03:52:22,742 --> 03:52:25,045
he's the one with the handy mistake, that's it.

3691
03:52:25,172 --> 03:52:29,754
Ah! They, they would like to some input on

3692
03:52:30,518 --> 03:52:33,516
what people like about those types of systems.

3693
03:52:33,517 --> 03:52:36,367
What they don't like, what you want to see them prove.

3694
03:52:37,356 --> 03:52:40,633
I have a feeling they might be looking at doing something with that.

3695
03:52:40,634 --> 03:52:44,856
So, yeah. Yeah, I know they're really good at building integration and,

3696
03:52:44,981 --> 03:52:49,531
you know, they're really nice if we can mark off something.

3697
03:52:49,532 --> 03:52:53,161
You can call it, you can call it, you it a side there,

3698
03:52:53,162 --> 03:52:55,769
and then mark it off in that total. Yeah, I'll be able to make

3699

3703
03:53:12,169 --> 03:53:15,474

what you think. That's how they start going.

3747

But, uh, it would be the playoffs. We

If we're going to be, please stay. Thank For a lot of power,

3768
03:58:01,679 --> 03:58:05,277
at least. We did, like, lighting packages with a thin cell,

3769
03:58:05,278 --> 03:58:08,592
and we were kind of like, More orders,

03:58:28,605 --> 03:58:31,531
But we're getting very much with the first step.

3777
03:58:31,532 --> 03:58:33,850

Alright, have day. Alright. Ok.

3821
04:01:32,336 --> 04:01:35,884

3822
04:01:35,885 --> 04:01:38,211
no, no, no, no, no, I did it.

3823
04:01:38,212 --> 04:01:40,711
I did it.

3824
04:01:40,712 --> 04:01:42,893
Did you get a phone? No, no,

3825
04:01:43,348 --> 04:01:46,294
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

3826
04:01:46,611 --> 04:01:48,756
no, no. and not the good.

3827
04:01:48,757 --> 04:01:52,645
Here, if you guys want to know,

3828
04:01:52,646 --> 04:01:55,313
it happens. It happens a little bit louder. If you're increasing better than what

3829
04:01:55,367 --> 04:01:58,140
they've had, you try out a Yes, sir.

3830
04:01:58,896 --> 04:02:01,181
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is that right?

3831
04:02:03,565 --> 04:02:05,621
I'm I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh,

3832
04:02:05,656 --> 04:02:09,760
look at this. Uh, you're saying all about it.

3833
04:02:09,761 --> 04:02:12,559
Yeah. Uh, uh.

3834
04:02:12,569 --> 04:02:16,400
What. Do you have travel, at least, was 40,000 weeks out of the year?

3835
04:02:16,401 --> 04:02:19,223
I think you have a lot of travel. If my wife will get away

3836
04:02:19,224 --> 04:02:21,701
from it. Okay,

3837
04:02:21,702 --> 04:02:24,743
yep. Okay, so I'm gonna need to experiment.

3838
04:02:24,941 --> 04:02:30,062
Bye, I'll be with you. Yeah. Yum. Good

3839
04:02:30,063 --> 04:02:32,808
to be honest.

3840
04:02:32,809 --> 04:02:36,257
Three. In here. Right kids. One,

3841
04:02:36,258 --> 04:02:40,850
two, three. Good bye. Good bye. And that one was

3842
04:02:40,851 --> 04:02:43,700
just born in August. So I'm brand new to you,

3843
04:02:43,701 --> 04:02:45,751
you know. And I- That's it.

3844
04:02:45,752 --> 04:02:45,751
That's it.

3845
04:02:49,843 --> 04:02:54,183
Yeah. Okay.

3846
04:02:55,220 --> 04:02:57,983
He's just, uh, three-four months old,

3847
04:02:57,984 --> 04:03:00,098
and so, but they's the right question.

3848
04:03:00,099 --> 04:03:02,260
Why am I sick? I'll ask him. Okay, cool. Well,

3849
04:03:03,030 --> 04:03:07,587
that's why I'm doing this one. Two of my three kids need five of

3850
04:03:07,588 --> 04:03:10,397
my glasses. No cheering because- Uh,

3851
04:03:10,407 --> 04:03:13,651
they found cataraphic worship. They played a lot more of them to hear it

3852
04:03:13,652 --> 04:03:16,359
and see how important it is when it's involved with your practice to cheer

3853
04:03:16,906 --> 04:03:19,263
Alright, I'm going back. I'm going back.

3854
04:03:19,494 --> 04:03:21,734
I'm going back. I'm going back. I'm You can see it here.

3855
04:03:22,072 --> 04:03:24,972
So then I'm going back. Maybe you gotta look at Southern California.

3856
04:03:24,973 --> 04:03:28,387
Yeah. Yum. How old are you kids?

3857
04:03:28,388 --> 04:03:28,451
Okay.

3858
04:03:34,711 --> 04:03:37,621
Do you have minor? 31,

3859
04:03:37,622 --> 04:03:40,130
26, 21,

3860
04:03:40,131 --> 04:03:43,466
and uh, heh, heh, heh. You Okay,

3861
04:03:43,467 --> 04:03:46,081
that's how I was late getting started. Yeah. I've been a,

3862
04:03:46,082 --> 04:03:48,894
uh,

3863
04:03:48,895 --> 04:03:51,127
19 year old and if you want to help me. Uuh,

3864
04:03:51,128 --> 04:03:53,163
uh, uh, huh. Uh,

3865
04:03:53,164 --> 04:03:55,674
uh, I was going to run a set of,

3866
04:03:55,675 --> 04:03:57,930
uh, organisms designed by him.

3867
04:03:57,931 --> 04:03:59,939
Thank you. I mean, it's just,

3868
04:03:59,940 --> 04:04:02,107
you know, I don't know what it is. So I'm putting a microphone to

3869
04:04:02,149 --> 04:04:04,951
a period where it says we're not having to get it,

3870
04:04:04,952 --> 04:04:09,626
we can't afford it. Uuh. Then they got

3871
04:04:09,627 --> 04:04:11,733
pregnant right away. Oh, yeah. Oh,

3872
04:04:11,734 --> 04:04:15,359
shit. Uh oh,

3873
04:04:15,360 --> 04:04:20,014
shit. . . I'm married, but he's a date-m-girl out of serious.

3874
04:04:20,100 --> 04:04:23,013
It hasn't, it hasn't been a little bit. He lives in DC,

3875
04:04:23,014 --> 04:04:27,524
he lives out. What you're going to contract is a wrap up

3876
04:04:27,579 --> 04:04:31,776
really, man. I understand what he does, but, um. I'm not going you.

3877
04:04:31,777 --> 04:04:36,185
Something with ArcGIS for the military.

3878
04:04:36,186 --> 04:04:39,811
His girlfriend has a real- .

3879
04:04:39,812 --> 04:04:44,818
She is our Secret Service in the

3880
04:04:44,819 --> 04:04:47,796
White House. Great. Very good.

3881
04:04:47,797 --> 04:04:51,059
So she was,

3882
04:04:51,060 --> 04:04:54,114
she was telling me back thanksgiving when they were home.

3883
04:04:54,115 --> 04:04:57,134
And they were poor.

3884
04:04:57,586 --> 04:05:01,598
She left. Really nervous.

3885
04:05:01,731 --> 04:05:04,552
She said very much. I'm not going to be able to do another check.

3886
04:05:04,553 --> 04:05:10,230
There. So

3887
04:05:10,231 --> 04:05:10,470
she, uh, she gave us a question on how to make a, almost, um,

3888
04:05:10,471 --> 04:05:14,981
three, but, uh, she learned that. I'm not sure if you can have

3889
04:05:16,479 --> 04:05:18,692
the National Guard or something like that.

3890
04:05:18,693 --> 04:05:20,796
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

3891
04:05:20,797 --> 04:05:22,870
She was leading. That was right. Two.

3892
04:05:23,069 --> 04:05:25,830
Her ship was done at two or five and that means she's walking you

3893
04:05:25,831 --> 04:05:28,771
with power. It's in the car radio and then it's off.

3894
04:05:28,772 --> 04:05:31,133
Once it's shot by me,

3895
04:05:31,134 --> 04:05:33,462
they'll, when that comes out,

3896
04:05:33,463 --> 04:05:35,421
you don't make it, if you're on the ground, you're hitting that I think

3897
04:05:35,422 --> 04:05:38,366
we're going to have now, so. And then we're going in and shutting the

3898
04:05:38,367 --> 04:05:40,465
white house down and, uhm,

3899
04:05:40,476 --> 04:05:43,757
you know, the secret service section of police is outside the white house as

3900
04:05:43,758 --> 04:05:48,736
well, okay. So that is actually her own co-workers

3901
04:05:48,737 --> 04:05:52,361
that were on the first ones. Right there with the guys.

3902
04:05:52,362 --> 04:05:55,872
Bye! That's a lot of real pretty staking up.

3903
04:05:55,873 --> 04:05:58,110
Huh. From that, so.

3904
04:05:58,174 --> 04:06:00,811
How's it going? Have a good one.

3905
04:06:00,812 --> 04:06:06,031
I just visited my daughter at

3906
04:06:06,083 --> 04:06:11,184
UNLV. Yep. you And I've stopped for the lunch at

3907
04:06:11,185 --> 04:06:13,519
St. George, Utah. Yeah.

3908
04:06:13,600 --> 04:06:17,796
As I'm drunk, I'm good to eat. We'll see you next time. I thought,

3909
04:06:17,797 --> 04:06:19,992
ah, how much one can sound, it's a little bit extra.

3910
04:06:20,761 --> 04:06:22,871
Like, I've never had a car. So,

3911
04:06:22,872 --> 04:06:25,253
you do that sport. Uh huh. You know,

3912
04:06:25,276 --> 04:06:27,092
come up next to me and if you look at it, that was a

3913
04:06:27,093 --> 04:06:29,142
day chart, but you've never seen it. Uh huh.

3914
04:06:29,325 --> 04:06:31,908
And, as I did for him,

3915
04:06:31,909 --> 04:06:34,401
the traffic was just- . . The complete shit show.

3916
04:06:34,550 --> 04:06:37,682
Yeah. I think they were to look at it in part to see what

3917
04:06:37,683 --> 04:06:39,877
they could see. Yeah. Yeah.

3918
04:06:39,878 --> 04:06:43,922
Definitely. Wow. There's a thing you're trying to find against me.

3919
04:06:43,923 --> 04:06:46,779
Yes. But I was all the way. I would go up to the,

3920
04:06:57,751 --> 04:07:01,589
I can imagine the one with a cheaper shirt,

3921
04:07:01,590 --> 04:07:04,370
and I have to tell you who's the last one.

3922
04:07:04,610 --> 04:07:07,491
I haven't been here. You know what? I didn't know this.

3923
04:07:07,492 --> 04:07:10,998
She was T.S.A. in Orlando Airport.

3924
04:07:11,007 --> 04:07:13,820
And T.S.A. I'm a little .

3925
04:07:13,821 --> 04:07:17,321
. I did not know that they were in the same department.

3926
04:07:18,959 --> 04:07:21,605
And so, you know, solve this as an opportunity.

3927
04:07:21,606 --> 04:07:24,285
with me. Of course you haven't really tried anything like that,

3928
04:07:24,286 --> 04:07:28,201
but they accept and earn you. But you don't really order them up to

3929
04:07:28,243 --> 04:07:30,876
you, which is really far as to be nice. I'm not,

3930
04:07:30,877 --> 04:07:34,128
it's a sign of the point. But is she part of the detective detail

3931
04:07:34,129 --> 04:07:36,362
or is she? Mm hmm. Yeah,

3932
04:07:36,363 --> 04:07:39,939
she's fully, Checked out,

3933
04:07:39,940 --> 04:07:42,509
you know, all the guns and everything.

3934
04:07:42,510 --> 04:07:44,684
So, you know, shoot that right in. Alright,

3935
04:07:44,685 --> 04:07:46,891
absolutely. She said- Well,

3936
04:07:46,892 --> 04:07:49,024
I'm not sure you can get it found. Normally,

3937
04:07:49,025 --> 04:07:51,136
they just, it's out because they're on their side.

3938
04:07:51,583 --> 04:07:55,657
But, when that happens, they- So I that there isn't looking for any longer

3939
04:07:55,658 --> 04:07:58,503
than she said. Yeah, it was quite,

3940
04:07:58,995 --> 04:08:01,905
you know. I was going to be looking for three or one to wait.

3941
04:08:01,906 --> 04:08:04,068
Good. Good. Okay. Okay. All the way up there.

3942
04:08:04,947 --> 04:08:08,842
She took us all the tools. Yeah, my hands. I was talking to my

3943
04:08:08,843 --> 04:08:12,610
man. Oh, we don't need them. I don't if that sucks over the street.

3944
04:08:13,177 --> 04:08:16,557
It's better than the community here or something. It's not just talking to them

3945
04:08:16,558 --> 04:08:21,072
in life. This is God's, You gotta get some everybody finish through the

3946
04:08:21,073 --> 04:08:24,629
thing that's talking to you. You gotta get I'm gonna explain to you this

3947
04:08:24,630 --> 04:08:27,731
one a little bit. Bye. I got scared and everyone was very sick.

3948
04:08:28,287 --> 04:08:32,167
Over the last 28 years he said, I was really like,

3949
04:08:32,627 --> 04:08:37,350
Prince sit down and- He

3950
04:08:37,351 --> 04:08:39,978
was like, he was like, just thought he'd come through, you know. Uhm,

3951
04:08:39,989 --> 04:08:42,276
but it only got a lot of stories. I'm going to shoot. Thank you.

3952
04:08:42,277 --> 04:08:44,467
Thank you. Yeah. Being interesting.

3953
04:08:44,468 --> 04:08:44,360
question.

3954
04:08:50,311 --> 04:08:53,613
I asked them,

3955
04:08:53,694 --> 04:08:57,082
I asked them how they've got to learn how to develop this,

3956
04:08:57,083 --> 04:08:59,332
hm. . . . ehm, ehm,

3957
04:08:59,333 --> 04:09:01,587
ehm, ehm,

3958
04:09:01,588 --> 04:09:04,215
ehm, ehm, ehm.

3959
04:09:06,396 --> 04:09:10,202
She said they're actually, they try to not watch a lot of stuff.

3960
04:09:10,822 --> 04:09:14,436
Hm. They don't want to be too biased when we leave them because,

3961
04:09:14,437 --> 04:09:16,874
They're going to the same thing being,

3962
04:09:17,106 --> 04:09:20,226
but, right? Yeah. But she said the flip saw that,

3963
04:09:20,227 --> 04:09:22,247
too, is her kind of seeing the movie.

3964
04:09:22,248 --> 04:09:26,373
Yeah. You know, hey, I do more than,

3965
04:09:26,374 --> 04:09:28,646
uhm, but she said it about, you know,

3966
04:09:29,005 --> 04:09:31,572

3967
04:09:31,573 --> 04:09:35,869

3968
04:09:35,870 --> 04:09:38,551
I don't know,

3969
04:09:38,552 --> 04:09:42,472
Okay.

Let's do it. Now, please look. You know what I I

04:09:50,084 --> 04:09:54,636
don't know what I mean. Okay. I'll next time.

3972
04:09:54,637 --> 04:09:59,600
He just worked the White House for this year to go on these advanced

3973
04:09:59,601 --> 04:10:01,748
teams, you know. These people drive.

3974
04:10:01,749 --> 04:10:07,197
So. So, The White House is her main focus.

3975
04:10:07,198 --> 04:10:09,772
When he travels, then they,

3976
04:10:10,220 --> 04:10:13,450
that's, I just volunteers that want to go on a trip with them.

3977
04:10:14,348 --> 04:10:18,399
And if they don't get volunteers, then they get volunteers.

3978
04:10:18,400 --> 04:10:20,895
So yeah. They should have been a good for 40 cents, you know,

3979
04:10:20,946 --> 04:10:24,402
and they should not have thought of driving too much, but they do have

3980
04:10:24,403 --> 04:10:27,300
to go a certain amount of trips over to Every Okay.

3981
04:10:35,911 --> 04:10:39,666
But, they don't fly on the plane.

3982
04:10:39,667 --> 04:10:42,721
What's your commendations right? All that it's right So,

3983

3984
04:10:45,907 --> 04:10:48,076
They're not flying their horseback. They're not.

3985
04:10:48,077 --> 04:10:53,147
They're not. Alright, see you How much

3986
04:10:53,148 --> 04:10:56,967
gear are you going to check with you?

3987
04:10:57,104 --> 04:11:02,086
Mm hmm. Okay. Let us see. I

3988
04:11:02,087 --> 04:11:04,389

3993
04:11:16,459 --> 04:11:19,462
Mhm. this is what I like, here was... just that Trump was just after

3994
04:11:19,463 --> 04:11:22,280
the Kennedy Center. Which is easy.

3995
04:11:22,281 --> 04:11:25,951
They had to take a hold.

3996
04:11:25,952 --> 04:11:30,877
In detail later, because she was working

3997
04:11:30,878 --> 04:11:33,996
that. But may that be cool because that was,

3998
04:11:33,997 --> 04:11:36,825
And a kiss was there,

3999
04:11:36,826 --> 04:11:39,788
um, George Street. I'm here to do all this.

4000
04:11:40,872 --> 04:11:44,322
Alright, let me see. We'll see you back in the next video.

4001
04:11:44,323 --> 04:11:50,016
Bye bye. Bye bye.

4002
04:11:50,017 --> 04:11:53,170
So all I know is that I still know.

4003
04:11:53,171 --> 04:11:53,351
Okay.

4004
04:11:58,951 --> 04:12:03,951
I'd

4005
04:12:04,219 --> 04:12:06,528
rather just stay open. Hehehehe. Alright, then,

4006
04:12:06,529 --> 04:12:12,395
we'll Can

4007
04:12:12,396 --> 04:12:14,083
I help you?

4008
04:12:31,411 --> 04:12:34,407
I heard a lot that,

4009
04:12:34,408 --> 04:12:39,051
uhh, like a lot of shops barely touched and gave it a delay,

4010
04:12:39,052 --> 04:12:42,428
but. But. I mean, I shouldn't,

4011
04:12:42,429 --> 04:12:47,491
I shouldn't feel better.

4012
04:12:47,492 --> 04:12:50,126
But, um,

4013
04:12:50,127 --> 04:12:52,460
yes, in the 60's,

4014
04:12:52,461 --> 04:12:54,348
we can more show them the clients I've had for a little bit. As

4015
04:12:54,349 --> 04:12:56,421
to make a Two, three, four, five,

4016
04:12:56,422 --> 04:12:58,932
and you usually learn historical. It's a bad app.

4017
04:12:58,933 --> 04:13:01,982
It's a technology in the slides. We don't probably need users.

4018
04:13:01,983 --> 04:13:04,530
We can just add them in the back. Uhh, uhh,

4019
04:13:04,531 --> 04:13:06,983
uhh, hm. Uhh,

4020
04:13:06,984 --> 04:13:11,771
uhh, ehhh,

4021
04:13:11,772 --> 04:13:14,079
uhh, uhh, eh. Uhh,

4022
04:13:19,656 --> 04:13:23,409
that's right. Yeah, we got a guy at dinner with last night when it

4023
04:13:23,410 --> 04:13:26,720
got full, that's sweet. Too powerful.

4024
04:13:26,721 --> 04:13:31,348
Yeah. up. That's right. I think that's where it

4025
04:13:31,487 --> 04:13:34,814
I'm and that that's where it was still in theown I have.

4026
04:13:34,815 --> 04:13:37,846
And I've got to still. I feel like I'm really old,

4027
04:13:37,847 --> 04:13:41,834
I'm thinking that. I will be down a little bit.

4028
04:13:42,713 --> 04:13:45,658
That's right. Peace. See you soon. Most of the time the estimators of the

4029
04:13:45,659 --> 04:13:47,879
retailers are the same people.

4030
04:13:48,086 --> 04:13:50,651
If you really ever said I'm willing to just come and eat it back.

4031
04:13:50,784 --> 04:13:53,320
Yeah. So, ah, yeah.

4032
04:13:54,968 --> 04:13:57,074
This may be the details we've been saying.

4033
04:13:57,075 --> 04:14:00,745
Let's, let's talk about 10 minutes and see if that's- I don't but I

4034
04:14:00,746 --> 04:14:06,194
don't see, I don't Thank

4035
04:14:06,195 --> 04:14:08,561
you very much. And that,

4036
04:14:08,562 --> 04:14:10,888
too, is really nice to me. Alright,

4037
04:14:10,953 --> 04:14:13,445
so this is my 100th birthday shop.

4038
04:14:14,021 --> 04:14:16,051
I'm gonna get it. So, you know. You're welcome.

4039
04:14:16,052 --> 04:14:21,052
I don't know how to

4040
04:14:21,053 --> 04:14:23,720
use this.

4041
04:14:23,721 --> 04:14:26,078
Thank you. Anyway, with this one project,

4042
04:14:26,358 --> 04:14:30,414
project managers feels like all-in-tea and everything,

4043
04:14:30,415 --> 04:14:33,574
which I don't understand. Because we're an old child,

4044
04:14:33,575 --> 04:14:36,700
if you are a thief. So if you learn to name your project,

4045
04:14:37,587 --> 04:14:39,786
that's what's happening to other new projects. I guess,

4046
04:14:39,787 --> 04:14:43,587
man. Actually, half my career has to be able to have the project benefit.

4047
04:14:43,588 --> 04:14:46,482
So I get to have the opportunity very much.

4048
04:14:46,483 --> 04:14:49,242
And I'll really like to get it.

4049
04:14:49,787 --> 04:14:52,290
It is, it is weird to have an idea to put it.

4050
04:14:52,291 --> 04:14:54,692
You know, that's, that's an, that's an, and I'm sure you have some project

4051
04:14:54,693 --> 04:14:56,813
right into it. Or all of a minute. . You know,

4052
04:14:56,814 --> 04:14:59,351
if I can stay in the middle of the room,

4053
04:14:59,352 --> 04:15:03,800
it's functional soon. And. Hold on.

4054
04:15:03,801 --> 04:15:04,587
Keep that in It's

4055
04:15:08,605 --> 04:15:13,020
just, it, um. It's just. tax tax base of $1,000.00 $2,000.00 in the $2,000.00

4056
04:15:13,021 --> 04:15:19,789
$2,000.00 in,000.00

4057
04:15:19,790 --> 04:15:21,953
a So, uhm,

4058
04:15:21,954 --> 04:15:23,984
uhm, hm, hm,

4059
04:15:23,985 --> 04:15:26,730
hm, hm, hm,

4060
04:15:26,731 --> 04:15:28,495
hm.

4061
04:15:38,076 --> 04:15:41,613
I hope they have a big money. I'm sorry I'm next to you to

4062
04:15:41,614 --> 04:15:44,277
show But you guys are out of the city,

4063
04:15:44,278 --> 04:15:46,493
so take a shot of a lot of body that pug. But I'll let

4064
04:15:46,494 --> 04:15:50,860
us apply them. I mean,

4065
04:15:50,861 --> 04:15:53,872
it's the cheapest way to increase.

4066
04:15:53,873 --> 04:15:58,763
Thank you. I mean, you know, the base models are about 300,000.

4067
04:15:58,764 --> 04:16:02,071
I think those, you know, performance. friends.

4068
04:16:02,072 --> 04:16:04,193
It's like a coasting saw in front of it.

4069
04:16:04,284 --> 04:16:07,179
Yeah. They're very, very nice set-ups,

4070
04:16:07,180 --> 04:16:10,051
but I think you're gonna leave her and smile.

4071
04:16:10,052 --> 04:16:13,148
Don't adjust for the homecoming, but it'd be more simple.

4072
04:16:13,149 --> 04:16:16,145
It's about a million bucks for it.

4073
04:16:16,146 --> 04:16:20,258
Yeah. We'll see in the I got the baby's shirt on the baby's shirt.

4074
04:16:21,102 --> 04:16:24,845
He launched what I'm a taxideric friend of the day, laying in the dress

4075
04:16:24,846 --> 04:16:28,559
all up next to you. I'm going to do this out on your plane.

4076
04:16:28,935 --> 04:16:32,293
But, yeah, that's not what you've communicated.

4077
04:16:32,294 --> 04:16:36,816
Okay. You know what,

4078
04:16:37,052 --> 04:16:40,178
I'm surprised when I'm out of the incident,

4079
04:16:40,179 --> 04:16:42,825
nobody's laughing. . . That's what you want,

4080
04:16:42,826 --> 04:16:46,527
eh, uhm, you can also take a read-by,

4081
04:16:46,528 --> 04:16:49,288
uh, email that I have. I'm like,

4082
04:16:49,289 --> 04:16:51,476
nah, nah, I'm a station,

4083
04:16:51,587 --> 04:16:54,089
I'm not a station. I'm a hundred African-Dawak program.

4084
04:16:54,090 --> 04:16:56,388
I'm possibly update this dimension.

4085
04:16:57,351 --> 04:17:01,120
I-I had a- I've heard that SBS were going to buy them,

4086
04:17:01,121 --> 04:17:03,331
because, you know, they've got to have a strong mission, which is,

4087
04:17:03,332 --> 04:17:06,848
uh, got to have a patent suite, and it really- I really don't like

4088
04:17:06,849 --> 04:17:09,343
this guy. Yeah, sure. That like button.

4089
04:17:09,663 --> 04:17:12,830
Yeah. And it's the best one. That'll be 5 trons.

4090
04:17:13,011 --> 04:17:15,324
I'm sure it'll be 5 trons. That. That's the best.

4091
04:17:15,325 --> 04:17:18,021
It'll be a test that will be right. I'll have it.

4092
04:17:18,550 --> 04:17:21,846
That's good man. Whoops man. I give best ears to the docile.

4093
04:17:21,847 --> 04:17:24,684
I know. Yeah. That's me. This is awesome.

4094
04:17:24,719 --> 04:17:27,224
I'm one of her dead surgeons. I still have business.

4095
04:17:27,225 --> 04:17:32,512
It's an abortion. Mm. You see

4096
04:17:32,513 --> 04:17:37,437
her in life. Yeah, I wanted to think these guys had been chasing

4097
04:17:37,438 --> 04:17:41,270
as well as a pencil. So Yeah. Problem is it's,

4098
04:17:45,219 --> 04:17:48,152
it's a paternal handling job. It's not- It's not a bad job.

4099
04:17:48,153 --> 04:17:51,665
Yeah. It's a technical pattern.

4100
04:17:51,666 --> 04:17:53,776
It's horrible. It doesn't order choosing until the cows go in.

4101
04:17:53,777 --> 04:17:56,116
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You But they have, like,

4102
04:17:56,117 --> 04:17:59,885
a hundred different designs. So,

4103
04:18:00,039 --> 04:18:02,045
have fun. They're all about it, you.

4104
04:18:02,046 --> 04:18:05,153
Thank And every week the schedule will move,

4105
04:18:05,154 --> 04:18:08,489
because the medical will come and end up with weeks co-authors for the weeks.

4106
04:18:08,684 --> 04:18:12,495
Yeah. And if you don't have all the design- Sometimes the pills,

4107
04:18:12,640 --> 04:18:15,908
you know, in your system are set up. They're at least thinking it was

4108
04:18:15,909 --> 04:18:19,051
part of the- you gotta get set up.

4109
04:18:19,052 --> 04:18:23,252
And again, it's 22 days, 22 working days to build one,

4110
04:18:24,063 --> 04:18:26,904
and then they pay a premium for 10 days.

4111
04:18:26,905 --> 04:18:31,741
Thank you. It's

4112
04:18:31,742 --> 04:18:33,802
just a game of managing the logistics of it. You just have to have

4113
04:18:33,803 --> 04:18:38,496
10 truck wheels. . . The fourth order sitting out there has got

4114
04:18:38,497 --> 04:18:41,303
to happen. And then you need all creates play.

4115
04:18:41,304 --> 04:18:44,739
Please. It's,

4116
04:18:45,222 --> 04:18:48,009
I've done it three times. I've never made money in the labor,

4117
04:18:48,010 --> 04:18:50,018
I know. It's three minutes.

4118
04:18:50,223 --> 04:18:52,673
But time you get s- So, Yeah. Well,

4119
04:18:52,674 --> 04:18:54,746
you're an enough later to just wrap it down.

4120
04:18:54,808 --> 04:18:57,712
Yeah. And, some new management team said,

4121
04:18:57,713 --> 04:18:59,017
let's do it again. It's like,

4122
04:19:07,111 --> 04:19:09,450
It's not that it feels like the one set of.

4123
04:19:11,068 --> 04:19:13,093
It's about. Yeah, it's almost like a fashion brand,

4124
04:19:13,094 --> 04:19:16,097
you know, where you need your braille and make your make. It is manufactured.

4125
04:19:16,238 --> 04:19:20,230
Yeah, it's absolutely right. Yeah, but it's not a piece and a dual it,

4126
04:19:20,231 --> 04:19:23,120
uh, because you're a pester and they're used to it all the time.

4127
04:19:23,121 --> 04:19:25,698
Umm, uhh, uhh, uhh,

4128
04:19:25,699 --> 04:19:31,169
hm. A

4129
04:19:31,170 --> 04:19:33,411
lot of work, you know, you know, and just,

4130
04:19:33,583 --> 04:19:36,555
you know, then just squeeze the additions.

4131
04:19:36,556 --> 04:19:39,091
Yeah, and then get everything. They're a lot weird.

4132
04:19:39,092 --> 04:19:41,143
And then figure out how to go, you know,

4133
04:19:41,144 --> 04:19:43,169
it's telling me how to go, maybe, you know,

4134
04:19:43,170 --> 04:19:47,136
we're setting up all the jigs, we're setting up, and then kill it.

4135
04:19:47,137 --> 04:19:50,520
Most, most, uh, people can't send us to get up with that and then

4136
04:19:50,624 --> 04:19:53,901
we'll go. Do more for Jay and I'll go.

4137
04:19:53,902 --> 04:19:57,782
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Instead, I'm gonna talk to you a little

4138
04:19:57,783 --> 04:20:02,004
bit about that. So I think they're an extra chill shot in Kansas City.

4139
04:20:02,005 --> 04:20:07,223
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We had a shot back there

4140
04:20:07,224 --> 04:20:10,225
in terms of-

4141
04:20:19,111 --> 04:20:24,245
Umm, ehm, ehm, ehm. That's why I'm

4142
04:20:24,246 --> 04:20:27,156
not pushing this. I'm going to try that.

4143
04:20:27,157 --> 04:20:29,777
So we were doing one with the bottom of the car.

4144
04:20:29,778 --> 04:20:33,271
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4145
04:20:33,357 --> 04:20:35,483
I mean, they felt completely capable. Okay, bye. Yeah.

4146
04:20:35,484 --> 04:20:39,375
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. listen badly at hunting,

4147
04:20:39,376 --> 04:20:43,000
right? You Yeah.

4148
04:20:41,322 --> 04:20:45,893
You Let's shut that contract

4149
04:20:45,894 --> 04:20:50,453
down on all of a sudden. Yeah, I'll be up. Thank you very

4150
04:20:50,454 --> 04:20:50,501
much.

4151
04:20:59,191 --> 04:21:01,254
Yeah, it's like, wow. And then,

4152
04:21:01,255 --> 04:21:04,512
It's like, oh, it's that.

4153
04:21:04,513 --> 04:21:08,971
Multiple people. I don't want it to be,

4154
04:21:08,972 --> 04:21:11,688
it's, uh, in the index area.

4155
04:21:11,720 --> 04:21:14,176
So, they're going to try to sell strings.

4156
04:21:14,177 --> 04:21:16,510
Good, I don't want it to entail,

4157
04:21:16,511 --> 04:21:19,117
but either pass those or,

4158
04:21:19,118 --> 04:21:23,196
uhm, doin' like the data center.

4159
04:21:23,197 --> 04:21:25,268
Yeah, I can imagine this.

4160
04:21:25,269 --> 04:21:27,958
If I was told in a pretty specific,

4161
04:21:27,959 --> 04:21:30,372
they'd have a lot of features.

4162
04:21:30,373 --> 04:21:33,252
issues. Yeah, a lot of curling.

4163
04:21:33,877 --> 04:21:36,387
But again, the day you're eating. It's a stop.

4164
04:21:36,532 --> 04:21:39,211
Alright. Bye-bye.

4165
04:21:39,212 --> 04:21:44,208
If you ever had a chip pad, all the utilities are on this floor,

4166
04:21:44,526 --> 04:21:47,191
and all the tools are on this floor. Yeah. Yeah.

4167
04:21:47,192 --> 04:21:50,491
So they set these tools on these two of the top tables.

4168
04:21:50,492 --> 04:21:53,557
Yeah. When all the people get started, they go negative telling them,

4169
04:21:53,558 --> 04:21:56,403
yeah. So they get a speaker. So these,

4170
04:21:56,404 --> 04:21:59,329
uh, tables are pretty complicated,

4171
04:21:59,645 --> 04:22:02,641
cutouts. Yeah, this is the other one.

4172
04:22:02,642 --> 04:22:04,697
I know. Oh I don't know. I don't know.

4173
04:22:04,698 --> 04:22:07,316
I don't know if they were being told that I was speech.

4174
04:22:07,885 --> 04:22:10,214
Okay. Here is their zone.

4175
04:22:10,665 --> 04:22:14,124
Okay. Bye. Yeah,

4176
04:22:14,125 --> 04:22:19,236
I know. They're too warm. I want them to.

4177
04:22:19,237 --> 04:22:23,242
It's not like they're being huge beer fans.

4178
04:22:23,243 --> 04:22:25,762
They're shaking them all over the place.

4179
04:22:25,763 --> 04:22:27,894
Thank very much. So it stops.

4180
04:22:28,937 --> 04:22:31,125
Now, I appreciate it. And I'm going to throw this out,

4181
04:22:31,219 --> 04:22:34,280
because they were just single fans, so I'm going to give them something in

4182
04:22:34,281 --> 04:22:36,502
here and move that way. That's bad. Okay. Yeah.

4183
04:22:36,729 --> 04:22:39,085
Well, just, you know, not my choice. Yeah,

4184
04:22:39,086 --> 04:22:43,708
I'll do it. Alright, I have the freedom to achieve this weather right

4185
04:22:43,709 --> 04:22:46,952
here. All right. All right. I'm gonna leave you out for a minute.

4186
04:22:47,556 --> 04:22:51,050
It's time to call the group. That is,

4187
04:22:51,051 --> 04:22:54,135
You Fifteen on those days,

4188
04:22:54,136 --> 04:22:56,340
no, it's a lot. So,

4189
04:22:57,012 --> 04:23:00,096
I think that's really well-looking now.

4190
04:23:00,097 --> 04:23:02,455
Well, that's a busy dude for you, but you have to look at it.

4191
04:23:03,325 --> 04:23:05,497
I have a lot of own new response. Oh, my life,

4192
04:23:05,498 --> 04:23:07,944
let's show this attack, my stomach binding, and we'll test it.

4193
04:23:07,945 --> 04:23:10,634
to it . That's uh, that's uh,

4194
04:23:10,645 --> 04:23:13,969
that's uh,

4195
04:23:13,980 --> 04:23:16,116
that's uh.

4196
04:23:16,117 --> 04:23:18,894
So, uhm,

4197
04:23:18,904 --> 04:23:22,519
a lot of people say it's from the GMOs of the genetically modified foods

4198
04:23:22,520 --> 04:23:26,360
we got. But. Bye. My body just can't recognize the,

4199
04:23:26,650 --> 04:23:29,909
the brains and all the different things that do to them anymore,

4200
04:23:29,910 --> 04:23:32,131
so. It can keep us here and.

4201
04:23:32,132 --> 04:23:36,675

I'm glad it's nice and cheerful. But,

4257
04:26:57,725 --> 04:26:59,906

4261
04:27:08,091 --> 04:27:11,361
mid-morning flex. I don't think you need flights to have all- and a He's

4275
04:27:51,596 --> 04:27:55,044
I'm gonna go out on the plane. We get down and then reverse the

4276
04:27:55,045 --> 04:27:58,749
jacks and everything and the all-place problem. I can take that out of you.

4277
04:27:58,750 --> 04:28:02,631
Yeah. Yeah. Totally alright. I might survive this one.

4278
04:28:03,478 --> 04:28:05,814
Yeah, I have another orange family so they got up on you.

4279
04:28:05,815 --> 04:28:10,493
Uh, too. Good. I've

4280
04:28:10,494 --> 04:28:14,266
seen a few, a few fights.

4281
04:28:14,267 --> 04:28:15,977
I've caught a player and they've already done, I've just got to show them

4282
04:28:15,978 --> 04:28:19,444
the, I've got them started. I know about the very cases they've already showed.

4283
04:28:19,804 --> 04:28:22,451
I've got to do it. I've I've got to show them some good shape.

4284
04:28:22,950 --> 04:28:27,606
Follow time. Follow up. Oh, yeah. And they're, they're helped out in Minnesota,

4285
04:28:27,607 --> 04:28:29,909
so I get a little brush for it. I don't need 30. I don't

4286
04:28:29,910 --> 04:28:32,196
need to get to the bugs.

4287
04:28:32,197 --> 04:28:35,378
Yeah. My flight was the offensive part from holidays,

4288
04:28:35,455 --> 04:28:38,566
and it's getting my two dogs watched here back home.

4289
04:28:39,133 --> 04:28:42,361
Bye. I used to boil them south with us,

4290
04:28:42,362 --> 04:28:44,844
but I got them done and all of them took it back,

4291
04:28:44,845 --> 04:28:48,211

4305
04:29:32,209 --> 04:29:35,353
So if I did all that before I started doing the front gear things,

4306
04:29:35,568 --> 04:29:40,389

4307
04:29:40,390 --> 04:29:43,819
lot. And so if I went home over there and I'm going to be

Cheers. Well,

4311
04:29:52,690 --> 04:29:55,520
don't come and get you, right? Because all I think I see is going

4312
04:29:55,521 --> 04:29:57,552
to find out who's the highest ranked person in,

4313
04:29:57,553 --> 04:30:00,276
uh, steerings of who you love.

4314
04:30:00,277 --> 04:30:02,726
If I'm not, if I don't get in first class, if I don't get

4315
04:30:02,727 --> 04:30:06,700
moved up, then I'll walk my first class and I'll see somebody up there.

4316
04:30:06,701 --> 04:30:09,232
If I see a kid or something. I'll there if they should stop.

4317
04:30:09,233 --> 04:30:12,276
Uh, oh, let's see. That must be very good.

4318
04:30:12,393 --> 04:30:16,296
Let's see. It makes the whole difference.

4319
04:30:16,297 --> 04:30:18,884
. Oh, it makes a huge difference.

4320
04:30:19,067 --> 04:30:21,176
Especially when you find one side of the necklace.

4321
04:30:21,177 --> 04:30:23,562
Yeah. Yeah. You're on your proper nose.

4322
04:30:23,563 --> 04:30:26,414
Yeah. Yeah. Blood out of the earth, spoken stuff.

4323
04:30:26,415 --> 04:30:28,984
A little bit from where I fly. I don't know if you can show

4324
04:30:28,985 --> 04:30:31,719
them. I got first about somebody out of here to get.

4325
04:30:31,720 --> 04:30:34,544
Yeah, that's it. That one would fly and make something better.

4326
04:30:34,701 --> 04:30:37,218
Most of my life is going to be an hour, so. Yeah,

4327
04:30:37,258 --> 04:30:39,829
I'm in here. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Yeah.

4328
04:30:40,156 --> 04:30:42,214
Yeah. So again, I've heard some of you saying,

4329
04:30:42,215 --> 04:30:46,320
yes, this is one. Okay.

4330
04:30:48,871 --> 04:30:51,952
I've got a lot to do, but my childhoods,

4331
04:30:51,953 --> 04:30:54,048
the Pacific Northwest are looking at us a little bit.

4332
04:30:54,049 --> 04:30:56,751
I'm really looking to see that for a little bit.

4333
04:30:56,752 --> 04:30:59,345
So I didn't have my bipartisan scarlet. It was up there.

4334
04:30:59,606 --> 04:31:01,736
I'm not. No, I, I'm not.

4335
04:31:01,737 --> 04:31:04,465
They're all playing kinda. All this is your turn.

4336
04:31:04,466 --> 04:31:10,133
I'm ahead and One, two. He's

4337
04:31:10,134 --> 04:31:12,996
holding this watch.

4338
04:31:12,997 --> 04:31:15,507
I just created the longest in the Philippines,

4339
04:31:15,508 --> 04:31:18,253
uh, living here in three days and look at four days a week.

4340
04:31:18,254 --> 04:31:21,031
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

4341
04:31:21,032 --> 04:31:23,409
We see each other in one another, so.

4342
04:31:23,410 --> 04:31:28,442
Yeah. I hope. If you're not around

4343
04:31:28,443 --> 04:31:31,193
in one day. You And, uh,

4344
04:31:31,203 --> 04:31:34,396
keep going out of here. Let's move back into some of the gather.

4345
04:31:34,930 --> 04:31:37,111
Once in a bit of a little gather. Keep going.

4346
04:31:37,112 --> 04:31:40,381
I don't quite like to see that all. I can't afford to hear me.

4347
04:31:40,654 --> 04:31:43,439
Yeah. See you for a day or two. It's nice to see you. It

4348
04:31:43,440 --> 04:31:45,673
was nice to see you. see you. It was see you. Uh,

4349
04:31:45,684 --> 04:31:48,447
some country guys. About three hours,

4350
04:31:50,716 --> 04:31:56,274
one minute. and So,

4351
04:31:56,275 --> 04:32:01,049
I used to go to Wisconsin a couple times and I went to Chicago

4352
04:32:01,050 --> 04:32:04,409
and . I never made it. I always got bogged in Chicago.

4353
04:32:04,482 --> 04:32:07,384
I finally said, I drove here,

4354
04:32:07,905 --> 04:32:09,271
flew up on a legion to ride.

4355
04:32:13,515 --> 04:32:15,317
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do for now, huh? Yeah. Cause you can't, that

4356
04:32:15,318 --> 04:32:19,107
you're not. Yeah,

4357
04:32:19,108 --> 04:32:23,646
I've refused to connect through it,

4358
04:32:23,647 --> 04:32:25,595
but one that I didn't want to struggle out on the stand. Yeah. I've

4359
04:32:26,481 --> 04:32:30,123
gotten discriminated more times so not in that sense.

4360
04:32:30,434 --> 04:32:32,814
I hate that, but it's the biggest American.

4361
04:32:32,815 --> 04:32:35,437
American. So, I don't know why you're the West Coast.

4362
04:32:35,438 --> 04:32:39,281
I'm going to be in the house. I'm going to eat it.

4363
04:32:39,282 --> 04:32:41,371
Okay.

4364
04:32:41,372 --> 04:32:46,059
Yeah, my dad wanted to be trusted about your reason for a,

4365
04:32:46,644 --> 04:32:48,850
you know, almost never combine a connector. in the direction.

4366
04:32:49,105 --> 04:32:58,009
So. It doesn't

4367
04:32:58,010 --> 04:33:00,911
actually find to bring that land to you.

4368
04:33:00,912 --> 04:33:05,705
Yeah. There we go. I

4369
04:33:05,706 --> 04:33:07,983
don't want some tea there.

4370
04:33:08,098 --> 04:33:13,591
I love Cinque. Cinque is so much stuff.

4371
04:33:13,592 --> 04:33:16,172
That's, ah,

4372
04:33:16,173 --> 04:33:18,485
and there are completely, you want a bunch of it,

4373
04:33:18,486 --> 04:33:21,636
so it's nice and yummy. There's a couple areas there. So that's enough.

4374
04:33:21,637 --> 04:33:26,162
. . What I think about CTAC going to know

4375
04:33:26,163 --> 04:33:28,434
is, going to security there, going to the camera. Okay.

4376
04:33:28,435 --> 04:33:31,056
you Some of those lines,

4377
04:33:31,207 --> 04:33:34,922
I mean, the reason I got century used to all the way that shit,

4378
04:33:34,923 --> 04:33:39,081
if you don't have a century, hmmm. Oh, I see tax lines to go

4379
04:33:39,082 --> 04:33:41,763
to, to fly to Canberra or just, um,

4380
04:33:41,773 --> 04:33:44,130
be just, be, be, be there now with,

4381
04:33:44,131 --> 04:33:46,284
uh, uhm, last time. I mean,

4382
04:33:46,285 --> 04:33:50,272
I guess I was playing. Here, maybe they have a different thing that they

4383
04:33:50,273 --> 04:33:53,791
had. Seven different T.S.A.

4384
04:33:53,792 --> 04:33:58,232
Check points for one area,

4385
04:33:58,233 --> 04:34:00,887
right? And that one gets you to the case A,

4386
04:34:00,888 --> 04:34:03,633
B, and C. See you. And, uh,

4387
04:34:03,643 --> 04:34:05,931
yeah. I mean, now, you know,

4388
04:34:05,932 --> 04:34:08,085
it's this, it's this custom splurge, right?

4389
04:34:08,086 --> 04:34:11,833
Now, you have a little entry. It's been a long You don't even almost

4390
04:34:11,834 --> 04:34:16,279
need to stop walking. You can just walk right through the face of recognition

4391
04:34:16,280 --> 04:34:18,780
issue. Use a spot. I'll see you So,

4392
04:34:18,781 --> 04:34:21,445
that's almost that problem,

4393
04:34:21,446 --> 04:34:25,951
if you don't have a purchase, now you're getting a V.

4394
04:34:25,952 --> 04:34:29,290
They're sold, you know, I don't think that's good.

4395
04:34:29,819 --> 04:34:32,116
I don't think any more here a few months ago.

4396
04:34:32,261 --> 04:34:34,156
I just had the keys in for a check. I got it. Now I'm

4397
04:34:34,157 --> 04:34:37,739
going to get clear, since I sat on the bird for 7 minutes and

4398
04:34:37,740 --> 04:34:40,797
days, got this dog. I'm going to get clear so I can get clear.

4399
04:34:41,014 --> 04:34:42,031
And it's pretty short.

4400
04:34:47,453 --> 04:34:48,780
I'm not going to explain it because Charlotte is a fan of me. I'm

4401
04:34:48,781 --> 04:34:51,015
going to show she's going to do right now. You He's showing me,

4402
04:34:51,024 --> 04:34:55,205
he gives it that I'll do it. But, heh,

4403
04:34:55,206 --> 04:34:57,210
heh. I don't think it's such a freaking hustle. Heh,

4404
04:34:57,230 --> 04:34:59,332
heh, heh. Heh,

4405
04:34:59,460 --> 04:35:02,200
heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. It's a experience,

4406
04:35:02,328 --> 04:35:04,887
good practice. So stay tuned.

4407
04:35:04,888 --> 04:35:08,203
10. 10. People in London are going to have to get a sip of

4408
04:35:08,204 --> 04:35:11,797
your check. A couple of times there is a law in London about getting

4409
04:35:11,798 --> 04:35:13,900
a pointer in the camera. Heh, heh, heh. You better.

4410
04:35:13,901 --> 04:35:16,441
I'll see you I hate it because I didn't do it for a bit,

4411
04:35:16,442 --> 04:35:19,614
so yeah. So maybe you'll like get that one and share it.

4412
04:35:19,729 --> 04:35:22,444
Heh. Yeah,

4413
04:35:22,445 --> 04:35:24,822
we must apply that, but I don't like it once, cuz I don't mind.

4414
04:35:24,823 --> 04:35:27,036
You're still all trying to get through. Yeah.

4415
04:35:28,377 --> 04:35:33,308
Mm-hmm. I hate that I'm a someone on the way to your

4416
04:35:33,309 --> 04:35:35,077
work, but I don't really know how to do it. As soon as I

4417
04:35:35,078 --> 04:35:38,371
get it, I'm trying to get it structured. Mm-hmm.

4418
04:35:38,372 --> 04:35:41,509
Yeah, that'll be a lot.

4419
04:35:42,121 --> 04:35:46,416
Lastly, I'll put a soft link to get home and,

4420
04:35:46,417 --> 04:35:49,231
I had a riddle, which I hate to be with.

4421
04:35:49,514 --> 04:35:52,611
And I actually got no real room here with the client,

4422
04:35:52,612 --> 04:35:57,256
so I had- Yeah. About an hour to perform a flight.

4423
04:35:57,390 --> 04:36:01,050
And then he said, there are a couple flights I might get on,

4424
04:36:01,051 --> 04:36:05,876
so I went on there for a- Bye! That's what you're leaving here at

4425
04:36:05,877 --> 04:36:09,321
3.6. We're time to get back for sure.

4426
04:36:09,322 --> 04:36:11,399
Good job. It's not really.

4427
04:36:11,814 --> 04:36:13,905
So, yeah, not really hard.

4428
04:36:14,437 --> 04:36:16,831
Oh, I've been thought later because it's 3.6,

4429
04:36:16,832 --> 04:36:19,065
but I'll show you how to go. I'm going to move it. Alright,

4430
04:36:19,066 --> 04:36:21,128
nice. Plus, I mean that. Three out.

4431
04:36:21,129 --> 04:36:23,765
Yeah. Seven down. Seven. So,

4432
04:36:23,919 --> 04:36:26,551
my flight leaves here.

4433
04:36:26,552 --> 04:36:28,684
Three forty-one, like,

4434
04:36:28,714 --> 04:36:31,189
I landed on thirty-eight. Of course, going back,

4435
04:36:31,190 --> 04:36:33,322
it's faster, because you catch the- Okay,

4436
04:36:33,323 --> 04:36:35,988
I'll catch the wind. Yeah. Yeah. Umm,

4437
04:36:35,998 --> 04:36:39,944
but yeah. Uh,

4438
04:36:39,954 --> 04:36:42,044
forty-one at home, so,

4439
04:36:42,045 --> 04:36:44,161
yes. Yes. I have to worry about it.

4440
04:36:45,750 --> 04:36:49,450
You've been correctly in Charlotte? I've been not done enough in Charlotte.

4441
04:36:49,451 --> 04:36:53,491
So, I've been fronting on just,

4442
04:36:53,492 --> 04:36:56,946
he moved from Phoenix to Houston. He worked for Dwight for Ferguson.

4443
04:36:56,947 --> 04:37:00,054
And I just- All let's get Yeah, do this. Moved back to Raleigh.

4444
04:37:00,055 --> 04:37:02,187
Uh, yeah. And, uh,

4445
04:37:02,198 --> 04:37:05,242
his wife's family's there and the parents need to care.

4446
04:37:05,243 --> 04:37:09,880
Yeah. Yeah. That's about two hours each

4447
04:37:09,881 --> 04:37:13,383
so the new thing. Probably as long as I say it in the video.

4448
04:37:13,384 --> 04:37:16,366
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm pretty happy to be able to be used

4449
04:37:23,371 --> 04:37:25,647
I'm going to move here. You know,

4450
04:37:26,490 --> 04:37:28,686
keep going this way. You know, back and forth.

4451
04:37:29,135 --> 04:37:31,416
Talk a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

4452
04:37:31,417 --> 04:37:34,601
Well, depends on if they want to build a shop,

4453
04:37:34,773 --> 04:37:36,743
if they want to do something, uh, where they want to be with us.

4454
04:37:36,744 --> 04:37:39,391
Mm-hm. Mm Mm-hm. Mm Mm It's not.

4455
04:37:39,392 --> 04:37:44,061
I can be here. There. I

4456
04:37:44,062 --> 04:37:46,743
get the sense that let's hear that the assets we have.

4457
04:37:46,744 --> 04:37:51,302
I don't know. But. And try and. Make those more productive.

4458
04:37:51,579 --> 04:37:53,787
I get a sense there's some of that. I have to. it.

4459
04:37:56,251 --> 04:37:58,413
I mean, there's so much binding work, you know,

4460
04:37:58,414 --> 04:38:01,007
sending them on is busy here. But they're so,

4461
04:38:01,008 --> 04:38:03,489
hey, the center is starting to understand.

4462
04:38:03,490 --> 04:38:06,916
Let's let him. I need work, uh,

4463
04:38:06,938 --> 04:38:10,547
in Arizona's mining state. There's so much work,

4464
04:38:10,548 --> 04:38:14,871
and I can come here. We're not really set up to do mining scale.

4465
04:38:16,153 --> 04:38:24,762
I don't. Are

4466
04:38:24,763 --> 04:38:28,822
you very useful? What's your next closest shot?

4467
04:38:28,823 --> 04:38:31,272
Good job. Other than this, we had a shot.

4468
04:38:31,521 --> 04:38:33,593
Did you hear it like what, Steve? No? No,

4469
04:38:33,594 --> 04:38:37,160
no, no, no, no, no, no. To be continued.

4470
04:38:37,161 --> 04:38:39,355
In the conversation. 18 18 19 It's just something, a rang-up, you know,

4471
04:38:39,356 --> 04:38:43,233
just on the closet. Could you hear the last one?

4472
04:38:43,234 --> 04:38:45,902
What is it? How do you drive up there? Thank It's,

4473
04:38:45,903 --> 04:38:49,517
uh, pretty small. I mean, I think most of those stuffs,

4474
04:38:49,518 --> 04:38:51,776
like, type back and stuff.

4475
04:38:51,812 --> 04:38:55,648
That's right. I don't have a lot of… The smaller one here.

4476
04:38:57,755 --> 04:38:59,910
What's the next closest one after that?

4477
04:39:00,024 --> 04:39:03,138
Casper one. I said, Casper only,

4478
04:39:03,274 --> 04:39:06,951
they have something Texas too. I'm very glad that at all.

4479
04:39:06,952 --> 04:39:09,028
I see it on the back. It was an important thing to do with

4480
04:39:09,029 --> 04:39:12,024
Casper. You know? Umm,

4481
04:39:12,035 --> 04:39:15,570
that's it. I think you're all paid for some parents,

4482
04:39:15,571 --> 04:39:19,873
you know? No. Bye. A lot of them don't cross these things.

4483
04:39:20,475 --> 04:39:23,312
I can't stop them. So,

4484
04:39:23,313 --> 04:39:25,405
uh, I've got to finish. There's,

4485
04:39:25,406 --> 04:39:29,479
My organic shop is supposed to be set up pretty well,

4486
04:39:29,480 --> 04:39:31,713
given who likes structural. Anyway,

4487
04:39:31,714 --> 04:39:34,177
there's no- I mean, they're important. A percent,

4488
04:39:34,461 --> 04:39:37,174
no you're putting around here! Deb, dum. Oooo.

4489
04:39:37,175 --> 04:39:41,084
Were we doing a bit by the minute?

4490
04:39:41,085 --> 04:39:45,707
Okay. Well, I think there's a very

4491
04:39:45,708 --> 04:39:49,087
sparse, it's a very structured shot.

4492
04:39:49,088 --> 04:39:52,290
Yeah. Yeah. Really? Mmm.

4493
04:39:52,291 --> 04:39:55,768
Hey, no, sir, when I walk your distribution, eh? But I think that's the

4494
04:39:55,769 --> 04:39:58,416
thought, couldn't be. But it's,

4495
04:39:58,417 --> 04:40:00,986
It's bringing, Oh,

4496
04:40:00,987 --> 04:40:03,828
it's bringing it right. Haha.

4497
04:40:03,829 --> 04:40:07,219
You got a plastic counter right there. Thank I got it over.

4498
04:40:08,336 --> 04:40:10,383
Somebody just got a come out there and gave it a stick.

4499
04:40:10,466 --> 04:40:13,371
You know, they got a little tiny pressed right here and a little tiny

4500
04:40:13,372 --> 04:40:17,427
shear. . That's the extended extraction,

4501
04:40:17,428 --> 04:40:21,255
which is an all-in-a-one, can you be reminded that you just can't.

4502
04:40:21,693 --> 04:40:23,782
That's an extended destruction set. Yeah, yeah,

4503
04:40:23,783 --> 04:40:26,025
yeah, yeah, yeah. So,

4504
04:40:26,026 --> 04:40:28,358
do you forget to mention that there is only a part of Part 2,

4505
04:40:28,359 --> 04:40:29,439
right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4506
04:40:30,660 --> 04:40:33,794
be heard before. So, I went there, I literally built that and she was

4507
04:40:33,795 --> 04:40:36,476
paid for every time I was a local. Now,

4508
04:40:36,477 --> 04:40:39,381
you can't even run it, and it's actually looking bad.

4509
04:40:39,382 --> 04:40:41,289
You I think it would be impressive if you didn't want us to be

4510
04:40:41,290 --> 04:40:43,468
rated so much. So.

4511
04:40:46,221 --> 04:40:49,172
And I've had it in 40 years and I don't. What's that?

4512
04:40:49,205 --> 04:40:51,343
Okay, we're on. No,

4513
04:40:51,344 --> 04:40:53,966
I just did. Okay. Okay. Okay.

4514
04:40:54,580 --> 04:40:56,904
Sim. Sim. Yeah, it's,

4515
04:40:58,033 --> 04:40:59,521
I don't know if it was a fly part of it. Yeah. But, most

4516
04:40:59,522 --> 04:41:03,931
of the- I'm sorry.

4517
04:41:03,932 --> 04:41:06,609
It's not like the aim of knowing that it's CPC.

4518
04:41:07,714 --> 04:41:11,976
It's not as long as that extra thing will. Yeah. Yeah.

4519
04:41:11,977 --> 04:41:14,639
That's, like, the multi-relationship that is.

4520
04:41:16,927 --> 04:41:19,952
I will withdraw and then the machine will discount.

4521
04:41:19,953 --> 04:41:19,880
No.

4522
04:41:28,051 --> 04:41:30,546
Was she not at the end of the day? Well, we're about everything,

4523
04:41:30,547 --> 04:41:34,081
but we shouldn't say she's not. We didn't know that the battery wasn't working.

4524
04:41:34,082 --> 04:41:36,096
We We didn't have this machine for the, Great.

4525
04:41:36,097 --> 04:41:40,038
I mean, barely two years. Why are the batteries working on that?

4526
04:41:41,442 --> 04:41:46,054
So. Go. I

4527
04:41:47,433 --> 04:41:50,690
mean, it worked out. Yeah. So. Good job.

4528
04:41:50,691 --> 04:41:53,513
Hi, I'm You know what I mean?

4529
04:41:54,038 --> 04:41:57,533
What's going on here? I kinda know. I think,

4530
04:41:57,781 --> 04:42:01,922
at least. And it always has. you It was at least 30 million dollars,

4531
04:42:01,923 --> 04:42:03,980
sure. So,

4532
04:42:03,981 --> 04:42:07,097
it's contained a little bit. And now,

4533
04:42:07,240 --> 04:42:11,594
breathe. We gotta settle. Go. You're about to get an equipment.

4534
04:42:11,595 --> 04:42:14,307
Look, dude, good to go. Yeah. Yeah.

4535
04:42:16,296 --> 04:42:19,594
It has a third. It just means to me that.

4536
04:42:20,686 --> 04:42:23,206
But if I'm, uh, now I'm coughing,

4537
04:42:23,207 --> 04:42:28,778
I'm not leaving. For

4538
04:42:28,779 --> 04:42:31,280
having this to be a month. I still don't Don't anywhere.

4539
04:42:31,281 --> 04:42:35,189
You're not Every just part of the piece,

4540
04:42:35,190 --> 04:42:39,006
man. Shut up, man. Go ahead.

4541
04:42:41,491 --> 04:42:44,905
I'm working on the name right now.

4542
04:42:44,906 --> 04:42:47,755
I even- I don't even I don't I don't even think this is this

4543
04:42:47,756 --> 04:42:52,338
job that we're going to use to all the- I

4544
04:42:52,339 --> 04:42:56,764
don't know the rest of the video today. That's the feeling that you still

4545
04:42:56,765 --> 04:43:00,084
can't help. Okay. With the jobs and actually you need shit wrong at the

4546
04:43:00,085 --> 04:43:04,513
end. Okay. This was not my biggest fight.

4547
04:43:04,668 --> 04:43:08,135
Somebody didn't like- One less child,

4548
04:43:08,327 --> 04:43:10,790
and I think they want it because they didn't do a bridge into child.

4549
04:43:11,452 --> 04:43:13,531
But there's no reason that a child went at the plant.

4550
04:43:13,532 --> 04:43:15,866
It should be competitive.

4551
04:43:16,149 --> 04:43:20,600
Here, here, and just that's up to Phoenix and just North Phoenix and Clarksdale.

4552
04:43:20,601 --> 04:43:25,254
See you. But I think

4553
04:43:25,255 --> 04:43:27,295
that's what everybody's saying. There's no reason.

4554
04:43:28,011 --> 04:43:30,825
Like, I think in the pipeline, we would- Okay,

4555
04:43:30,826 --> 04:43:33,963
let's sit in that. I have to say, that's my plan. If they can

4556
04:43:33,964 --> 04:43:37,558
sell for a form, you can just farm that out.

4557
04:43:37,559 --> 04:43:42,196
Question, go ahead. It's how- I don't think we're ever going to be able

4558
04:43:42,197 --> 04:43:46,531
to- That was a strong work.

4559
04:43:46,532 --> 04:43:50,467
It's just not going to be a job that fits here and for it.

4560
04:43:50,468 --> 04:43:52,860
A lot. I think you see what they do in that one.

4561
04:43:52,997 --> 04:43:58,717
Me too. Yeah. It's not going to be a job that's

4562
04:43:58,718 --> 04:44:02,240
going to be And back to the bone.

4563
04:44:02,551 --> 04:44:05,347
Back to all the difficult customers. You know, everybody's going to forget to dive

4564
04:44:05,348 --> 04:44:08,267
in them. Oh, they're brutal. Very documentation.

4565
04:44:08,268 --> 04:44:11,950
I look up at it anytime soon. I look up at the drives that

4566
04:44:12,044 --> 04:44:15,265
you can go on. See, back to the other. They get,

4567
04:44:15,266 --> 04:44:18,347
they get some open worlds. It's not too bad.

4568
04:44:18,348 --> 04:44:20,870
No. That's really unusual about it, but it's,

4569
04:44:21,854 --> 04:44:24,063
for your evidence, all the typewraps,

4570
04:44:24,064 --> 04:44:26,183
it is like, it's called the major.

4571
04:44:26,184 --> 04:44:29,368
We'll see minute. Crisis, you know, it's good to forgive you.

4572
04:44:30,814 --> 04:44:33,743
But I think it's a tricky job, but I don't think we're set up

4573
04:44:33,744 --> 04:44:38,461
here to do it. You get the drawings in November 26th,

4574
04:44:38,462 --> 04:44:42,100
and you got to deliver 7,000 times. You said March of 27th.

4575
04:44:42,091 --> 04:44:44,681
Yeah, it is. It's, it's,

4576
04:44:45,137 --> 04:44:47,269
it's all fun. Ah,

4577
04:44:47,270 --> 04:44:49,736
it just means that some day I'm, they're,

4578
04:44:49,737 --> 04:44:51,958
they're not even. You I'm not to release it yet, cause they don't,

4579
04:44:51,959 --> 04:44:55,189
they didn't have to. What? Yeah,

4580
04:44:55,190 --> 04:44:57,268
I see it, I believe in that one of these.

4581
04:44:57,588 --> 04:44:59,844
Same way as asking. We have the, tepla,

4582
04:44:59,852 --> 04:45:02,293
can we have stuff? The end of the time is pretty fun,

4583
04:45:02,294 --> 04:45:04,937
too, it's like, ugh, you're gonna be doing all this size,

4584
04:45:04,955 --> 04:45:12,735
and you have a short period of time, again. Thank So

4585
04:45:12,736 --> 04:45:13,747
the truth of that, that thing, if you look at the e-mail-

4586
04:45:22,591 --> 04:45:25,528
Yeah. And after those,

4587
04:45:25,636 --> 04:45:27,681
I couldn't even have worked to see that.

4588
04:45:28,312 --> 04:45:30,940
But I think it actually came from some- I mean,

4589
04:45:30,941 --> 04:45:33,166
Denver, that hurt about this.

4590
04:45:33,326 --> 04:45:35,350
And, uh, I don't think it was here.

4591
04:45:35,468 --> 04:45:37,844
I think it was stuck somewhere else. Umm.

4592
04:45:37,854 --> 04:45:41,764
You And then they gave her an extension until the twenty-second,

4593
04:45:41,765 --> 04:45:45,344
uh, they marked what we think out of the twenty-second to put the bid

4594
04:45:45,345 --> 04:45:46,591
in. So how are we-

4595
04:45:50,732 --> 04:45:52,290
We're not. It's just a bidding exercise. I think we're going to find out

4596
04:45:52,291 --> 04:45:54,631
that back to the shop's weather. Yeah.

4597
04:45:54,632 --> 04:45:56,642
And there's gonna be, that's just my guffin.

4598
04:45:57,169 --> 04:46:03,688
And that's gonna be the most historical show I've watched in my Because

4599
04:46:03,689 --> 04:46:06,663
there's not much out there. Salt Lake City,

4600
04:46:06,664 --> 04:46:09,177
much out there. Yeah, it's the beginning. SME.

4601
04:46:09,341 --> 04:46:14,743
And that's all I can Yeah,

4602
04:46:14,744 --> 04:46:16,990
I haven't told you to look at it.

4603
04:46:16,991 --> 04:46:18,130
I mean, they probably aren't responding to them for short. I'll catch you next

4604
04:46:18,131 --> 04:46:18,481
time.

4605
04:46:26,616 --> 04:46:28,759
So, send them all out there.

4606
04:46:28,760 --> 04:46:33,868
Alright? Alright? There's no lady that has another blackboard

4607
04:46:34,656 --> 04:46:36,813
Yeah, right. Ah, ah, ah,

4608
04:46:36,814 --> 04:46:39,978
hm, hm, hm, hm, hm,

4609
04:46:39,979 --> 04:46:50,671
hm, hm.

4610
04:46:50,672 --> 04:46:53,249
I don't like it. I like to, uhh,

4611
04:46:53,260 --> 04:46:56,327
actually just have that thought. Then I'm into the one unit with that.

4612
04:46:56,883 --> 04:47:01,780
After I intake the j- I was already working in Canada.

4613
04:47:01,781 --> 04:47:04,604
My community there.

4614
04:47:04,822 --> 04:47:07,713
That, uh, was We'll see how it goes. Yes. So I went there to

4615
04:47:07,714 --> 04:47:10,779
run that shop and stopped.

4616
04:47:10,780 --> 04:47:16,082
I'll see you down in

4617
04:47:16,083 --> 04:47:18,469
the panel at the same time. I know you've got to work with people

4618
04:47:18,470 --> 04:47:21,199
that are 100-bit okay. See ya.

4619
04:47:22,046 --> 04:47:24,614
And I know- I know they have one up here too even then.

4620
04:47:25,176 --> 04:47:27,803
I know they've got to, you know, get that shot here.

4621
04:47:29,121 --> 04:47:31,282
Thanks for engaging probably. Okay. It's like,

4622
04:47:31,283 --> 04:47:33,983

4623
04:47:33,984 --> 04:47:36,087
It's like, I need something like it. Wait up.

4624
04:47:36,088 --> 04:47:38,585
Thank you. Now.

4625
04:47:38,586 --> 04:47:43,485
You I do not to go in

4626
04:47:43,486 --> 04:47:47,259
anyways. There's- Just in,

4627
04:47:47,260 --> 04:47:51,223
in Salt Lake, just a little south of Salt Lake,

4628
04:47:51,224 --> 04:47:53,242
and it's going to be all these over here.

4629
04:47:53,572 --> 04:47:55,602
Alright, so you're going to be with them. I don't want them to manage

4630
04:47:55,603 --> 04:47:57,980
their, their, their KSM ski jobs.

4631
04:47:58,071 --> 04:48:00,572
I don't want them to drive the KSM ski jobs here.

4632
04:48:00,573 --> 04:48:05,315
Yeah. Yeah. These aren't because they're a structural steel and plate that

4633
04:48:05,357 --> 04:48:07,501
was ignoring them softly. Yeah,

4634
04:48:07,502 --> 04:48:09,751
but I don't know what was last to me.

4635
04:48:09,752 --> 04:48:13,667
Umm, they're, they're in the J.T.

4636
04:48:13,668 --> 04:48:18,014
Spiel is spurtin' literally about two blocks from S.A.

4637
04:48:18,015 --> 04:48:20,621
Okay. I don't I'm really not gonna sit.

4638
04:48:21,461 --> 04:48:24,064
So, they need to.

4639
04:48:25,534 --> 04:48:29,869
I haven't mentioned anything yet. And I want a little bit of workout,

4640
04:48:29,870 --> 04:48:31,543
but these are good. When I was in the first time I got to

4641
04:48:31,544 --> 04:48:36,138
talk, I couldn't get it. Yes, but. We need to so much

4642
04:48:36,139 --> 04:48:39,217
of this stuff. I'm gonna be sorry. I'm gonna be sorry.

4643
04:48:39,218 --> 04:48:41,955
I'm gonna be sorry. What's that?

4644
04:48:41,956 --> 04:48:44,849
I'm gonna be sorry. Sorry. I thought,

4645
04:48:45,231 --> 04:48:47,645
you know, art is an anime and something to do with it.

4646
04:48:47,646 --> 04:48:51,192
Well, yeah, I think that's not gonna be the type of thing that has

4647
04:48:51,193 --> 04:48:55,040
to be- . I want to. that did it.

4648
04:48:55,041 --> 04:48:57,809
It says, I told them, currently, he became the authorities,

4649
04:48:57,810 --> 04:49:00,034
I've arrived. And he said, C.O. C.O. C.O. Yeah,

4650
04:49:00,221 --> 04:49:02,750
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

4651
04:49:03,013 --> 04:49:06,880
yeah, yeah. Okay.

4652
04:49:06,881 --> 04:49:09,450
There you go. I know that's interesting. Okay,

4653
04:49:09,451 --> 04:49:11,454
I'm gonna take a few of those. Okay.

4654
04:49:12,337 --> 04:49:15,801
I know that's fine.

4655
04:49:15,802 --> 04:49:16,344
Bye

4656
04:49:22,180 --> 04:49:27,180
.

4657
04:49:41,611 --> 04:49:46,161
Let's see if I can read

4658
04:49:46,162 --> 04:49:49,565
it and like once because it was done.

4659
04:49:49,566 --> 04:49:52,107
you But they want to sell us,

4660
04:49:52,108 --> 04:49:55,136
uh, labor that's semi-truck law,

4661
04:49:55,137 --> 04:49:57,984
clean up, to re-mittal industries,

4662
04:49:58,142 --> 04:50:02,531
really. . . And, you know, maybe one thing,

4663
04:50:02,532 --> 04:50:05,314
if we took play, sold it to the job.

4664
04:50:05,315 --> 04:50:12,166
Good job. So these heads were once divided

4665
04:50:12,167 --> 04:50:14,611
into the edges.

4666
04:50:14,612 --> 04:50:19,722
... ... ... that's fine. I don't have time to run

4667
04:50:19,757 --> 04:50:23,371
like, I mean. You 896,

4668
04:50:23,372 --> 04:50:25,516
240, 4-3, 4-3,

4669
04:50:25,517 --> 04:50:28,197
6-8, 8-9. That's,

4670
04:50:28,198 --> 04:50:30,801
that's wild. And,

4671
04:50:30,802 --> 04:50:34,102
uh, they got a seat in person.

4672
04:50:34,103 --> 04:50:37,920
One of you's through, uhh, hmmm.

4673
04:50:37,921 --> 04:50:41,228
itzelah. I've got 3316, I think that's the lowest they go.

4674
04:50:41,229 --> 04:50:44,291
Uhm, there's only 964,

4675
04:50:44,292 --> 04:50:46,374
is that 46, uhh,

4676
04:50:46,384 --> 04:50:50,033
said. . . Ah, the limit. And what it's like,

4677
04:50:50,034 --> 04:50:53,640
Smith's up, there around 64.

4678
04:50:53,641 --> 04:50:57,944
for So that's not the Texas,

4679
04:50:57,945 --> 04:51:02,671
alright? They'll deliver it.

4680
04:51:02,672 --> 04:51:06,278
Because they got trucks coming into the valley. And then a lot.

4681
04:51:06,777 --> 04:51:08,925
And then it's going that way. It's just great.

4682
04:51:08,926 --> 04:51:12,298
They just can't judge it by the night. I don't have,

4683
04:51:12,299 --> 04:51:14,783
and that's kind of what I'm pushing to get this in the front.

4684
04:51:14,784 --> 04:51:18,260
Because if I don't have a solid plate, it'll be close. We'll be right

4685
04:51:18,261 --> 04:51:20,903
Alright guys, so Fun, I guess there's some arts that have jobs.

4686
04:51:21,432 --> 04:51:26,229
And the track, the usage isn't going to divide a conqueror and skeleton with

4687
04:51:26,230 --> 04:51:29,234
everything but- . Then I'm gonna get started.

4688
04:51:29,424 --> 04:51:34,284
I've got a good flake inventory. I can pull a cost into and-

4689
04:51:34,285 --> 04:51:37,061
. I and then call it out to myself.

4690
04:51:37,062 --> 04:51:39,678
Yeah. And and do kind of an intro.

4691
04:51:39,679 --> 04:51:42,696
Are we done? That's all, period. Thank you much.

4692
04:51:42,697 --> 04:51:45,844
I want to use the word easy, but I don't want to use the-

4693
04:51:45,845 --> 04:51:48,796
I don't think this is really, uh,

4694
04:51:48,806 --> 04:51:50,965
but it's super, super simple. We'll see you Yeah,

4695
04:51:51,144 --> 04:51:53,368
I, I, uhm,

4696
04:51:53,379 --> 04:51:56,418
that's one of two types of super quick. So.

4697
04:51:56,419 --> 04:51:58,449
Yeah, that'd be our best edit machine.

4698
04:51:58,450 --> 04:52:01,385
You Yeah, of all of them. I hear nothing but good things,

4699
04:52:01,386 --> 04:52:03,756
and they're like the investors. Yeah.

4700
04:52:04,671 --> 04:52:09,376
In the beginning, forget. There go. It's a-it's a-it's a-it's

4701
04:52:09,377 --> 04:52:12,359
asound good. You're the music guy and might not want to come and pick

4702
04:52:12,360 --> 04:52:14,620
it up cause now Michael trunks down in her and….

4703
04:52:14,621 --> 04:52:19,656
Yeah, that's the thing though. He beats everybody's prices here and then like,

4704
04:52:19,657 --> 04:52:22,711
well, he's-he's eating them. Oh yeah, this guy.

4705
04:52:22,712 --> 04:52:25,672
There's the 26 cents a pound in the infrastructure.

4706
04:52:26,355 --> 04:52:29,540
I'm like, okay, I wouldn't have sat. And then I'm just gonna get So

4707
04:52:30,691 --> 04:52:33,698
How's that working, exerias? Uhh,

4708
04:52:33,708 --> 04:52:36,705
well, they pick up our interior. It'll pick it up there again,

4709
04:52:36,706 --> 04:52:38,736
and I'm gonna bring it back. So, I didn't. Just.

4710
04:52:38,737 --> 04:52:42,476
. It's really affecting us. But, ah, maybe we have a lot of alpha-9

4711
04:52:42,477 --> 04:52:44,804
in it. I think it's stuck across the border,

4712
04:52:44,805 --> 04:52:49,875
uh, my issue with the- I don't mean to eliminate the trucks

4713
04:52:50,285 --> 04:52:53,970
to get that done. There's times where,

4714
04:52:54,188 --> 04:52:57,638
like- I don't get it moving up the bus, because we have the one

4715
04:52:57,639 --> 04:53:01,445
extra piece of it, and then there's a bit of all the LITRs.

4716
04:53:01,833 --> 04:53:04,345
It's easy to deal with. Okay, by the way, we had two or two

4717
04:53:04,346 --> 04:53:06,549
pieces, uhh, because there was an offer to go.

4718
04:53:06,998 --> 04:53:09,735
Let's go. Start. So,

4719
04:53:09,779 --> 04:53:12,459
I'm talking to the ladies. See the, you know, you should get back to

4720
04:53:12,460 --> 04:53:14,955
me. You know, I can't find that stuff,

4721
04:53:14,956 --> 04:53:17,471
you know. I've been, you gotta have a couple names,

4722
04:53:17,472 --> 04:53:21,015
it's a call. Oscar, and somebody else is like,

4723
04:53:21,525 --> 04:53:24,307
it's like, pulling feet in the whole language. If I can look it up.

4724
04:53:24,786 --> 04:53:27,722
Yeah, I don't want my head. This is pretty good,

4725
04:53:27,723 --> 04:53:30,697
uhm, pretty good. It's back and forth with,

4726
04:53:30,698 --> 04:53:32,777
uhm, that's good. I'd say,

4727
04:53:32,778 --> 04:53:37,056
uhm, good bo- the operation of all my projects is sure to get off

4728
04:53:37,057 --> 04:53:39,285
of this. Really? So, then even,

4729
04:53:39,344 --> 04:53:42,751
I mean, next door to materials that I'm still looking for.

4730
04:53:42,752 --> 04:53:44,785
So we're also about two months,

4731
04:53:45,202 --> 04:53:47,427
but I'm just keeping it in any regard. I love it.

4732
04:53:48,164 --> 04:53:50,731
I think it was a really big deal right here. Yeah.

4733
04:53:50,230 --> 04:53:52,758
Yeah. That's really good.

4734
04:53:52,926 --> 04:53:55,566
I think so. That's what I thought.

4735
04:53:55,567 --> 04:53:57,980
Yeah. Very good. Yeah. I Come here.

4736
04:53:58,771 --> 04:54:02,310
I think they've been around for forever since our time.

4737
04:54:02,572 --> 04:54:04,620
So yeah. So they got that,

4738
04:54:04,621 --> 04:54:06,751
that mark. It's making it hurt. Uh, nah.

4739
04:54:11,512 --> 04:54:12,072
I heard the little mexico thing. I've never heard that. I think they're what,

4740
04:54:12,073 --> 04:54:14,087
are you Mexican? Yeah. Yeah.

4741
04:54:14,396 --> 04:54:17,550
You Yeah, Mark. Could you repeat them while I had,

4742
04:54:17,551 --> 04:54:21,304
uhm, uhm, could progress all the way down there into the facility.

4743
04:54:21,510 --> 04:54:25,474
That'll be mexico. Okay. And that it can sound like a clock,

4744
04:54:25,475 --> 04:54:28,885
or they can call the, uh, the keep all the workers,

4745
04:54:29,282 --> 04:54:34,188
a, a task force. more. So they can't figure out something

4746
04:54:34,189 --> 04:54:36,260
to do. And everything's all,

4747
04:54:36,261 --> 04:54:38,562
we're into the team there. Very accordingly.

4748
04:54:38,563 --> 04:54:43,542
or anything. I just don't trust the stuff that we can have with somebody

4749
04:54:43,543 --> 04:54:46,722
sometimes in this film. I seeing my I love seeing I love this I

4750
04:54:46,723 --> 04:54:50,939
love seeing There was a while there we got into the tip of it,

4751
04:54:50,940 --> 04:54:53,519
the gravels because they couldn't get in there in front of it.

4752
04:54:54,510 --> 04:54:57,118
See ya. Thank Yeah, I was there.

4753
04:55:00,747 --> 04:55:03,557
That's an oldie. Uh,

4754
04:55:03,567 --> 04:55:06,984
thank you. Thank I didn't expect a 130-25.

4755
04:55:06,985 --> 04:55:10,506
Ah, that was a while ago. Hahaha. Hahaha.

4756
04:55:11,460 --> 04:55:14,768
Hahaha. The instate's been there,

4757
04:55:14,769 --> 04:55:17,018
some of us, uh, probably has talked more bad,

4758
04:55:17,019 --> 04:55:20,201
I don't mean. That's including where I've started to occur.

4759
04:55:20,202 --> 04:55:24,200
Umm, uhm, post, has taken me from the top of the sector.

4760
04:55:24,201 --> 04:55:27,192
Uh, it is an entry into the sport.

4761
04:55:27,712 --> 04:55:32,197
The only- The only thing that I also believe is being,

4762
04:55:32,198 --> 04:55:35,119
uh, uhm,

4763
04:55:35,120 --> 04:55:39,058
approximately I mean, cutting eggs, cutting a lot of all of their materials.

4764
04:55:39,380 --> 04:55:43,996
It's been no reason by direction that every body will possibly be less

4765
04:55:43,997 --> 04:55:47,689
than a minute. I challenge the first victory on that.

4766
04:55:49,900 --> 04:55:52,351
See, oh!

4767
04:55:52,352 --> 04:55:55,790
That was pretty close. That's all I'm going to need about 16 grams,

4768
04:55:55,791 --> 04:55:59,131
so I'm guessing we'll just stay adding on the, on the habit of this.

4769
04:55:59,132 --> 04:56:03,152
thank you. Oh. Or it's copying this one,

4770
04:56:03,153 --> 04:56:06,498
I guess, is probably gonna get this order placed tomorrow.

4771
04:56:06,652 --> 04:56:10,858
Go some in the- Yeah,

4772
04:56:10,859 --> 04:56:14,741
awesome.

4773
04:56:14,742 --> 04:56:17,584
You you Yeah.

4774
04:56:18,492 --> 04:56:20,715
But, you know,

4775
04:56:20,716 --> 04:56:24,511
I don't work. Uh-huh.

4776
04:56:24,512 --> 04:56:29,341
Let's do a quick pass and see

4777
04:56:29,342 --> 04:56:32,343
if, uh, a king of the industry.

4778
04:56:32,344 --> 04:56:34,700
you Thank you to the Port of 307.

4779
04:56:34,715 --> 04:56:35,184
So, I know.

4780
04:56:48,631 --> 04:56:51,755
Hm, hm.

4781
04:56:51,756 --> 04:57:01,386
Bye. I've

4782
04:57:01,387 --> 04:57:03,833
had some lessons in the rest. Thanks much.

4783
04:57:15,714 --> 04:57:20,714
Uhh,

4784
04:57:21,057 --> 04:57:26,057
Uhh,

4785
04:57:28,836 --> 04:57:33,240
You know what I You know what I mean.

4786
04:57:33,241 --> 04:57:37,994
Come back to your home. Back to your- You know what for

4787
04:57:37,995 --> 04:57:37,500
Good.

4788
04:57:45,751 --> 04:57:50,347
One thing that I'm questioning

4789
04:57:50,348 --> 04:57:53,558
here is that that's about if I direct you down by the right doesn't

4790
04:57:53,565 --> 04:57:58,272
end it and direct you. That points

4791
04:57:58,273 --> 04:58:01,005
on where the program actually is.

4792
04:58:01,006 --> 04:58:06,719
Umm. Okay. I

4793
04:58:06,720 --> 04:58:08,121
mean, it couldn't be, like, man, I have both. I don't know about the

4794
04:58:08,122 --> 04:58:11,052
words. It's a bad choice. We'll see you So,

4795
04:58:11,064 --> 04:58:13,556
which version I wanted to run for that case?

4796
04:58:13,856 --> 04:58:17,211
It may be with only one inch force for riding on the base,

4797
04:58:17,244 --> 04:58:19,449
but it's just different than mine. So,

4798
04:58:19,450 --> 04:58:23,037
ah, okay. There you go.

4799
04:58:23,848 --> 04:58:26,796
Let's see. Mmm.

4800
04:58:26,797 --> 04:58:28,847
. . Just try to see that.

4801
04:58:28,848 --> 04:58:33,466
Um, the P bring in a little bit.

4802
04:58:33,467 --> 04:58:38,302
So I

4803
04:58:38,303 --> 04:58:41,105
was going to be sitting at home and seeing your reason why it would

4804
04:58:41,106 --> 04:58:43,716
be a different thing to be a recipe. to be the first This is

4805
04:58:43,717 --> 04:58:48,418
the same service in privacy. Okay. Unless

4806
04:58:48,419 --> 04:58:50,791
it's just not uhm, uhm, I mean they can have that.

4807
04:58:50,792 --> 04:58:54,434
They can start it, but I mean they can create it and not start

4808
04:58:54,435 --> 04:58:58,254
it with the service. That might be the only other thing.

4809
04:58:58,255 --> 04:59:03,068
Good. Whilst trying to pull the picture back

4810
04:59:04,987 --> 04:59:07,317
there. It's all over.

4811
04:59:07,318 --> 04:59:10,253
It's on. You see that? Wow, there's shots over here.

4812
04:59:10,254 --> 04:59:13,417
So, usually it's just like, you want to go outside search and you run

4813
04:59:13,418 --> 04:59:17,945
that part too. But that was- I remember that once and I don't

4814
04:59:18,323 --> 04:59:21,845
know. That was her misquining. She was like,

4815
04:59:21,846 --> 04:59:26,678
yeah, that's her name. Great. Just go ahead

4816
04:59:26,883 --> 04:59:28,920
and put something in the generations for the work. Okay.

4817
04:59:32,671 --> 04:59:35,623
Umm,

4818
04:59:35,634 --> 04:59:37,786
yeah, ehm. Thank you.

4819
04:59:40,771 --> 04:59:44,428
Um, you can say that there's a moment,

4820
04:59:44,429 --> 04:59:47,323
uh, from both sides. Um, you can still go here. Alright.

4821
04:59:47,324 --> 04:59:54,086
So. . . Okay.

4822
04:59:54,087 --> 04:59:56,200
Seeing a new college should be, uh,

4823
04:59:56,211 --> 04:59:59,254
so far. 4 3 No,

4824
04:59:59,321 --> 05:00:01,408
no, no, no, no,

4825
05:00:02,232 --> 05:00:04,896
no, no, No, no, You've been apparently submitted everything for our games.

4826
05:00:04,897 --> 05:00:07,438
This is the only one over Thank you.

4827
05:00:21,691 --> 05:00:26,383
That's perfect.

4828
05:00:27,043 --> 05:00:31,340
It's been intense. It's been intense. It's been intense. You It's .

4829
05:00:37,771 --> 05:00:40,133
Yeah.

4830

you

4831
05:01:26,011 --> 05:01:28,362
This is going to be a crunch. That's just the amount that you had

4832
05:01:28,363 --> 05:01:31,987
to find in it. Yeah. Here it asks,

4833
05:01:31,988 --> 05:01:32,963
can you look where? There.

4834
05:01:42,931 --> 05:01:45,250
I think it's that portrait of that on theaters.

4835
05:01:45,251 --> 05:01:45,533
purposes.

4836
05:01:51,920 --> 05:01:55,615
Uhh,

4837
05:01:55,616 --> 05:01:57,689

Well,

4874
05:06:26,537 --> 05:06:28,637
uh,

4875
05:06:28,647 --> 05:06:32,331
one year, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4876
05:06:32,906 --> 05:06:34,920
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4877
05:06:34,921 --> 05:06:39,214
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4878
05:06:39,414 --> 05:06:40,642
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4879
05:06:41,172 --> 05:06:41,483
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4880
05:06:47,071 --> 05:06:49,481
ehm,

4881
05:06:49,630 --> 05:06:52,360
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

4882
05:06:52,391 --> 05:06:58,020
ehm, That's

4883
05:06:58,021 --> 05:07:00,328
why I'm going to place a little bit bigger in the yard.

4884
05:07:00,329 --> 05:07:07,599
3 4 5 So

4885
05:07:07,600 --> 05:07:10,170
they can just go wrong in here. man.?

4886
05:07:10,171 --> 05:07:14,706
1 That's fine.

4887
05:07:14,707 --> 05:07:20,027
But I don't know why. I don't think that's the way it system. You

4888
05:07:20,028 --> 05:07:24,484
know, you share. Ha ha ha ha ha.

4889
05:07:24,485 --> 05:07:27,816
Oh. I'm going to go.

4890
05:07:27,817 --> 05:07:30,005
Yeah. Yeah, that's my new one.

4891
05:07:30,777 --> 05:07:32,342
I heard someone made me want to have it on my second, so he's

4892
05:07:32,343 --> 05:07:37,050
been doing a lot of other things. So, happens here. All

4893
05:07:37,051 --> 05:07:40,121
right, let's excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Stop here,

4894
05:07:40,122 --> 05:07:43,661
I'm running an official name, Mary. I don't have any team in this room.

4895
05:07:43,662 --> 05:07:47,468
Thank you. Oh, okay. I meant the other thing,

4896
05:07:47,469 --> 05:07:49,803
but, uh, there's more on the next presentation,

4897
05:07:49,804 --> 05:07:53,119
yeah. All right. We're winning,

4898
05:07:53,206 --> 05:07:57,955
or I'd use probably every start-out server is where everyone's gonna serve

4899
05:07:57,956 --> 05:07:59,976
it, and it should be in, like, land.

4900
05:07:59,977 --> 05:08:03,831
Yeah, that's what it is. Our regular one's working just fine.

4901
05:08:03,832 --> 05:08:08,363
Uhm, it's just this new port and not having- I saw

4902
05:08:08,364 --> 05:08:13,022
it with it, so. But we can

4903
05:08:13,023 --> 05:08:17,570
at least go over, uhm, kind of. I'll see you what

4904
05:08:17,571 --> 05:08:21,905
I'm here looking for. I'm there. I'm assuming probably pretty similar to that dog.

4905
05:08:21,906 --> 05:08:24,091
He is definitely known for wire with me.

4906
05:08:24,092 --> 05:08:26,346
It's a place of water broke out in there,

4907
05:08:26,347 --> 05:08:29,847
in cages, and the purpose of the lines of the wire,

4908
05:08:30,235 --> 05:08:32,540
and then the purchase of the light at least. For,

4909
05:08:33,448 --> 05:08:35,456
I guess, five items for a electrical start.

4910
05:08:35,457 --> 05:08:37,737
Uhm,

4911
05:08:37,747 --> 05:08:41,568
and uh, hopefully it will never happen to the water in the Indian season.

4912
05:08:41,569 --> 05:08:45,471
It's been a stressful morning to you all. I remember this one.

4913
05:08:45,472 --> 05:08:48,211
Okay. All right.

4914
05:08:48,212 --> 05:08:48,211
All right.

4915
05:08:53,360 --> 05:08:54,289
But, you know, you normally have, like, hundreds to drop, but yeah, boom. Umm,

4916
05:08:54,290 --> 05:08:56,704
um. Bye. I mean,

4917
05:08:56,705 --> 05:08:59,188
it's like 47,000 feet, but uhh.

4918
05:08:59,189 --> 05:09:01,321
Um, the idea,

4919
05:09:01,322 --> 05:09:03,608
the biggest, the biggest concept, um,

4920
05:09:03,619 --> 05:09:08,396
is, We're putting a lot of effort to do any bin modeling,

4921
05:09:08,397 --> 05:09:10,614
uhm, on the actual side,

4922
05:09:10,923 --> 05:09:19,011
but you see just support. The level

4923
05:09:19,012 --> 05:09:20,664
of detail we're going to go through for a lot of models. the It

4924
05:09:20,665 --> 05:09:23,058
is, I mean, it's an LED 400,

4925
05:09:23,059 --> 05:09:25,767
so it's worth the model and that's in washroom.

4926
05:09:25,851 --> 05:09:28,048
It's pretty out here,

4927
05:09:28,049 --> 05:09:31,618
so. So, if we're putting such a cost into doing this,

4928
05:09:31,730 --> 05:09:35,534
I want to be a little leveraged, uhh,

4929
05:09:35,544 --> 05:09:40,363
the abilities of- hmm, so that we can actually

4930
05:09:40,364 --> 05:09:44,496
run it through,

4931
05:09:44,497 --> 05:09:46,965
As this if it were a structural thing,

4932
05:09:46,966 --> 05:09:51,871
right? Uhm, and where I'm running- Thanks

4933
05:09:51,872 --> 05:09:56,320
for running to is it's where all the assemblies are,

4934
05:09:56,504 --> 05:10:00,576
for the most part, unique from a struggling- I'm struggling.

4935
05:10:00,577 --> 05:10:03,503
In a rod length, but from the grand scheme of things,

4936
05:10:03,504 --> 05:10:06,633
we're only like 10 different types of designs. We're just good at what we're

4937
05:10:06,634 --> 05:10:10,293
doing. Umm, and then, But everything's done with that.

4938
05:10:10,639 --> 05:10:14,145
So, if I knew just an IFCX for that,

4939
05:10:14,146 --> 05:10:16,656
I would use all of my metadata.

4940
05:10:16,657 --> 05:10:19,722
So, I don't really know that it's a keep my glasses straight.

4941
05:10:19,723 --> 05:10:23,238
I don't know that it's half the brad, it's just a body shape there.

4942
05:10:23,243 --> 05:10:27,506
I know. So what I've been working on is within revenue,

4943
05:10:27,507 --> 05:10:30,955
I can actually create a VOM that has accept.

4944
05:10:31,105 --> 05:10:35,039
Prangers and then. And. and And we can actually create a stencil spreadsheet that

4945
05:10:35,040 --> 05:10:39,704
defines what those are. And if we can leverage that I appreciate

4946
05:10:39,705 --> 05:10:42,749
where we can bring that in. And technically, technically,

4947
05:10:42,750 --> 05:10:46,982
we need to know that it's the exact body from the model standpoint.

4948
05:10:46,983 --> 05:10:51,706
We just need to know how to correlate it soon. And

4949
05:10:51,707 --> 05:10:54,435
so if we can come up with that system and figure out where to

4950
05:10:54,436 --> 05:10:56,856
carry those cut lengths. Thanks.

4951
05:10:56,857 --> 05:10:59,369
And just the overall assembly types.

4952
05:11:00,026 --> 05:11:02,163
I think we could just treat it as a word of fact.

4953
05:11:02,681 --> 05:11:04,896
And we could still do our. Bye.

4954
05:11:04,897 --> 05:11:09,299
We can still do our cues, we shippings,

4955
05:11:09,770 --> 05:11:14,251
everything like that. And so our budget will pre- We're talking,

4956
05:11:15,076 --> 05:11:17,332
I mean, thousands of trapey supports.

4957
05:11:17,646 --> 05:11:20,016
We can, you know, do the same thing for it.

4958
05:11:20,017 --> 05:11:21,808
Saw, operator. I'm going a little And then you take care of all of

4959
05:11:21,809 --> 05:11:23,823
this, uhm, cutless,

4960
05:11:23,824 --> 05:11:26,945
that he's been given that day. Yeah. And then go for that.

4961
05:11:27,206 --> 05:11:29,775
So that's like a deep picture that's on Of what?

4962
05:11:30,379 --> 05:11:33,553
We're trying to accomplish. So I can,

4963
05:11:33,554 --> 05:11:36,006
uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm,

4964
05:11:36,016 --> 05:11:39,290
see here. Here we go. We can make sure I understand some of the

4965
05:11:39,291 --> 05:11:44,128
feedback while I think I understand. Uhm, you're looking- If please the ship in

4966
05:11:44,129 --> 05:11:48,436
and have you're working on export without you that say no,

4967
05:11:49,231 --> 05:11:52,006
we're getting the right format. Two more of them here than we can do

4968
05:11:52,007 --> 05:11:55,280
the best thing before. So, we've been considering a case file,

4969
05:11:55,620 --> 05:12:00,238
I think, and I'm not saying on themselves files.

4970
05:12:00,365 --> 05:12:04,892
Bye. And it's the easiest thing that we can clearly

4971
05:12:04,893 --> 05:12:07,099
define what that material is.

4972
05:12:07,345 --> 05:12:10,277
It's from itself. Yeah. Umm,

4973
05:12:10,288 --> 05:12:13,252
and then, and then I've developed a little trick.

4974
05:12:13,860 --> 05:12:16,808
It's been working so far as my gaming commission on,

4975
05:12:16,809 --> 05:12:18,914
like. Bye. Like, uh, uh,

4976
05:12:18,915 --> 05:12:21,220
TR1 is a single-tiered,

4977
05:12:21,353 --> 05:12:24,160
trippy support, and then it can come up with,

4978
05:12:24,161 --> 05:12:26,378
you know. So,

4979
05:12:26,379 --> 05:12:29,145
all of it, they're all usually typically rise and then,

4980
05:12:29,301 --> 05:12:33,391
like, a B would be, the top definition would be a B in fact.

4981
05:12:33,392 --> 05:12:35,490
And, like, a big hatch,

4982
05:12:35,491 --> 05:12:38,531
uh, spring down on the other side or something.

4983
05:12:38,532 --> 05:12:40,960
Yeah, I can show you how to look at it. better time to do

4984
05:12:40,961 --> 05:12:45,929
like this. . . I don't know if shooting it.

4985
05:12:45,930 --> 05:12:48,041
But I think . . . I can build a beetle wound .

4986
05:12:48,042 --> 05:12:51,867
. within rabbit to You need whatever parameters you need.

4987
05:12:51,956 --> 05:12:54,177
Yeah. Well,

4988
05:12:54,178 --> 05:12:57,451
it can be easy, uhm, important. Okay.

4989
05:12:57,452 --> 05:13:01,028
Well, right. And it had a lot of,

4990
05:13:01,029 --> 05:13:03,527
a lot of themes on it, and I'll share the ones that are,

4991
05:13:03,914 --> 05:13:08,060
that are required things. Thanks. The next part is what you guys have been

4992
05:13:08,061 --> 05:13:11,521
doing with, like, the chair of the database is a special extract.

4993
05:13:11,522 --> 05:13:13,536
It's the same thing you did, um, e-go is.

4994
05:13:13,537 --> 05:13:16,831
Because here they're gonna have just a standard K-1000 people,

4995
05:13:16,832 --> 05:13:19,438
they're running, they're pretty unique shapes,

4996
05:13:19,439 --> 05:13:21,571
and then we're talking.

4997
05:13:21,572 --> 05:13:24,070
You know, y'all might have seen further cold,

4998
05:13:24,147 --> 05:13:26,565
you know, they're not going to stay in this,

4999
05:13:26,749 --> 05:13:29,616
but they're not a lot of big, cold that we haven't.

5000
05:13:29,617 --> 05:13:34,350
Three. Two

5001
05:13:34,351 --> 05:13:36,398
tests fasten in my head, stay in power,

5002
05:13:36,399 --> 05:13:39,634
you should see my video. Thank you. I'm not if there's any mess in

5003
05:13:39,635 --> 05:13:43,480
that That's true.

5004
05:13:44,105 --> 05:13:47,622
My voice plays the word for spinning. So much money in a wholesale,

5005
05:13:47,662 --> 05:13:51,003
just engage in a level of detail that in the new R.I.R.

5006
05:13:51,308 --> 05:13:55,219
a lot of our bins were required. Okay, bye. So here,

5007
05:13:55,220 --> 05:14:00,188
where's the actor

5008
05:14:00,189 --> 05:14:04,756
that you Thank you. So we might as well be fabricating it to

5009
05:14:04,757 --> 05:14:05,311
that. Yeah.

5010
05:14:09,811 --> 05:14:12,199
So what I've done in the past so far is,

5011
05:14:12,200 --> 05:14:14,726
like, I would send, uhm,

5012
05:14:14,737 --> 05:14:17,547
the, these guys, just a, a list of shots.

5013
05:14:17,548 --> 05:14:20,788
Go. Right? Or list of raw things or anything like that.

5014
05:14:20,789 --> 05:14:23,957
And they just kind of mainly put it in and we'll be able to

5015
05:14:24,124 --> 05:14:27,813
deliver it and go back. Alright. Oh. But I definitely want to take it

5016
05:14:27,814 --> 05:14:30,377
a step further on.

5017
05:14:30,378 --> 05:14:35,133
Thank you. Yeah, and then I

5018
05:14:35,134 --> 05:14:38,361
still think we just have the flexibility during the one-offs,

5019
05:14:38,459 --> 05:14:40,482
like, this wire is taking the time. Yeah. And.

5020
05:14:40,867 --> 05:14:46,258
Yeah. Because I don't think that's anything we want to build into

5021
05:14:46,339 --> 05:14:48,341
our system, as part of the wire lengths,

5022
05:14:48,342 --> 05:14:51,288
is what makes it this. and this is the end of That's just kinda

5023
05:14:51,289 --> 05:14:53,605
what I want to to deal with.

5024
05:14:53,606 --> 05:14:56,578
Or just bring yourself out and have a linear, linear session.

5025
05:14:56,579 --> 05:14:59,039
Yeah. Perfect. Yeah, Yeah. BuhThree Yeah, I may say no,

5026
05:14:59,040 --> 05:15:01,866
I'm glad you agree with it. You know, it's not a good length,

5027
05:15:01,867 --> 05:15:04,777
5 length. It's, it's just only a good length for people.

5028
05:15:04,797 --> 05:15:07,645
And then when it's, it's a, And, you know, curse down the,

5029
05:15:07,646 --> 05:15:10,879
you know, ask, it's like a sheer nesting. Like, let's be read about,

5030
05:15:10,947 --> 05:15:14,256
you know, we don't have, you know, curved cuts on the monitor.

5031
05:15:14,257 --> 05:15:19,483
But, yeah, uhm.

5032
05:15:19,493 --> 05:15:22,570
Suddenly, you're the best. It's been,

5033
05:15:22,571 --> 05:15:26,557
I- I've been on it. I just haven't got to the point of the-

5034
05:15:26,558 --> 05:15:29,820
the any more excited. I'm just- I'm just trying to get ours up.

5035
05:15:30,507 --> 05:15:32,596
Let's grab it. Friends,

5036
05:15:33,115 --> 05:15:36,950
it's a different thought approach on how to build your assemblies here.

5037
05:15:36,951 --> 05:15:39,216
It's their family approach to the city.

5038
05:15:39,217 --> 05:15:43,110
You have to kind of have a good degree set up beforehand.

5039
05:15:43,686 --> 05:15:48,348
And it's not as, to me it's definitely not even- you have useful

5040
05:15:48,349 --> 05:15:52,842
in a prefab application, in a type where yes,

5041
05:15:52,843 --> 05:15:57,420
umm, but. Bye. It's the industry standard to do an mechanical

5042
05:15:57,421 --> 05:15:59,908
design. It's bad.

5043
05:15:59,909 --> 05:16:03,211
It's good. It's good. Thank you.

5044
05:16:03,212 --> 05:16:07,876
And then all the other

5045
05:16:07,877 --> 05:16:12,211
software research on how other,

5046
05:16:12,212 --> 05:16:14,381
The actual top, the width,

5047
05:16:14,462 --> 05:16:17,407
yep. And they're bringing the rabbit, but then it's very,

5048
05:16:17,925 --> 05:16:20,191
it's very cumbersome, compared to the,

5049
05:16:20,192 --> 05:16:23,022
Like, one stop, oh, they're technically hard,

5050
05:16:23,023 --> 05:16:27,836
guys. Like, they're still doing their part of cues and combining in a separate

5051
05:16:27,837 --> 05:16:32,462
area. eeuh, so, not directly from estimating where new they need.

5052
05:16:32,480 --> 05:16:34,870
And if you follow me, I'll go over that. I'll go over that.

5053
05:16:35,367 --> 05:16:37,638
I'll just go and tell So, would you do at least the trial,

5054
05:16:37,639 --> 05:16:39,716
uh, sit for a month? Because, well,

5055
05:16:39,717 --> 05:16:42,236
we can't say, and they're stuck in the air out there,

5056
05:16:42,237 --> 05:16:47,211
but it's a bit more than There's one thing soft around here

5057
05:16:47,212 --> 05:16:52,445
that- that you actually- I

5058
05:16:53,902 --> 05:16:56,728
would say combine and extract better.

5059
05:16:56,747 --> 05:16:59,289
Yep. And it's only really useful though.

5060
05:16:59,290 --> 05:17:01,521
All right. So over here. Oh, okay. We're to go. You're trying to actually

5061
05:17:01,555 --> 05:17:04,097
breathe out, like, a face of conduits that,

5062
05:17:04,098 --> 05:17:07,712
you know, and then also, like, growling, like an entire room.

5063
05:17:07,713 --> 05:17:10,196
You're gonna be, It's got a more suited for that,

5064
05:17:10,375 --> 05:17:12,518
but it's not, it's still not producing cutless,

5065
05:17:12,519 --> 05:17:16,231
it's still not nesting, it's just treating it like uhh.

5066
05:17:16,232 --> 05:17:18,369
Uh, B-O-N, and you know what, you're flying,

5067
05:17:18,370 --> 05:17:20,785
I guess, and leads into a shipable. Yeah.

5068
05:17:20,953 --> 05:17:24,399
It doesn't, the cover, like I said, the purchasing doesn't cover any- and the

5069
05:17:24,400 --> 05:17:28,397
labor tracking doesn't cover it, so it should be able to sleep better.

5070
05:17:28,466 --> 05:17:30,812
So, uh, what's happening, like, in one here,

5071
05:17:30,813 --> 05:17:32,828
we describe it in the water. Well,

5072
05:17:32,829 --> 05:17:34,854
I'm gonna make this work.

5073
05:17:36,509 --> 05:17:40,231
And it's, cause it's, our feet have at least a dirt.

5074
05:17:40,232 --> 05:17:45,219
And, um, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm. Also 100% adjustment,

5075
05:17:45,533 --> 05:17:48,271
sure, easy, it's an basic support. So, a lot of stuff we're doing.

5076
05:17:48,272 --> 05:17:50,561
It's, it's single conduit runs, uh,

5077
05:17:50,572 --> 05:17:52,703
it's nothing else we need to, to free fabric, like,

5078
05:17:52,704 --> 05:17:55,452
a fuel bank and give out the fuel.

5079
05:17:55,632 --> 05:18:01,102
I think that- I don't want

5080
05:18:01,103 --> 05:18:03,860
to hear that one. It's like, it doesn't invite me to easily implement.

5081
05:18:03,861 --> 05:18:06,821
it. you And then, and then move on to the next part of the

5082
05:18:06,822 --> 05:18:09,447
studio. I think it's gonna give you a stage box that will lead to

5083
05:18:09,448 --> 05:18:11,701
you. I'll say it to you quickly.

5084
05:18:11,702 --> 05:18:13,720
You get it all before I do.

5085
05:18:13,786 --> 05:18:16,408
It's just like, uhm, let me give you some points and then we can

5086
05:18:16,409 --> 05:18:18,422
route it to separate shops. So, I'd say,

5087
05:18:18,648 --> 05:18:21,367
yeah, this shops, uhm. . Slow down,

5088
05:18:21,705 --> 05:18:24,535
we can route all of our truck processing here.

5089
05:18:24,536 --> 05:18:27,706
And we can have a lot of fun with cuss, yeah. It's time to

5090
05:18:27,746 --> 05:18:30,342
make you do- final assembly dash shot.

5091
05:18:30,416 --> 05:18:32,462
Yeah, vermin. I mean,

5092
05:18:32,463 --> 05:18:34,966
cuz we- we did all those silky frames, right?

5093
05:18:35,157 --> 05:18:38,398
And that would have been- She kind of leveraged out at the flexor shop,

5094
05:18:38,399 --> 05:18:40,445
where we did a done here, we did a done some here,

5095
05:18:40,446 --> 05:18:42,807
some there. Um,

5096
05:18:42,808 --> 05:18:47,036
but, umm, I'm not sure. Yeah, because that's our lecture shops.

5097
05:18:48,297 --> 05:18:51,566
More, more geared towards the higher drawing stuff,

5098
05:18:51,567 --> 05:18:54,736
but we got the big. . . Okay, and so.

5099
05:18:54,737 --> 05:18:59,409
So, here's a

5100
05:18:59,410 --> 05:19:02,438
spreadsheet such as reduced. so far.

5101
05:19:02,439 --> 05:19:04,853
.

5102
05:19:04,854 --> 05:19:08,364
.ok . I'll send to you now… with Ye,

5103
05:19:08,365 --> 05:19:13,074
it's- . . It's time to do that this

5104
05:19:13,241 --> 05:19:16,549
way. Yeah,

5105
05:19:16,550 --> 05:19:19,875
I think it's okay if it does something. I love you. Hm.

5106
05:19:21,934 --> 05:19:24,535
Ah. Mercy.

5107
05:19:24,536 --> 05:19:27,148
Hm. I sure.

5108
05:19:27,149 --> 05:19:32,060
You like, if I ask, there's nothing you have to be able

5109
05:19:32,061 --> 05:19:36,770
to see from the end. Or. ,commissioning

5110
05:19:36,771 --> 05:19:38,993
your big media of that is almost true,

5111
05:19:38,994 --> 05:19:42,379
you can say about the address. So it is really good.

5112
05:19:42,380 --> 05:19:47,137
You I said that's supposed to be which important you're in and you just

5113
05:19:47,138 --> 05:19:51,276
buy it in. Yeah. Cause it's all set up and you save it.

5114
05:19:51,277 --> 05:19:53,482
You know, we're paying it and that can be fine.

5115
05:19:53,483 --> 05:19:55,640
updates.

5116
05:20:15,631 --> 05:20:20,488
Up

5117
05:20:20,489 --> 05:20:47,270
in the teens. Hah. Um,

5118
05:20:47,271 --> 05:20:51,805
ehm, ehm, So, it's of our higher volume type products

5119
05:20:51,806 --> 05:20:54,706
for, like, the data side. So,

5120
05:20:54,707 --> 05:20:57,905
it's definitely an- a lot more of the same assemblies,

5121
05:20:57,906 --> 05:21:01,450
but, uh, same concept. I don't know why it's just the,

5122
05:21:01,451 --> 05:21:05,268
uh, larvae number of- But uh,

5123
05:21:05,278 --> 05:21:07,480
you need some of those verses by your lines.

5124
05:21:07,481 --> 05:21:17,857
So go to the last day, Kevin. Bye. And

5125
05:21:18,014 --> 05:21:22,323
so, pretty much with, You can set up for the pre-drive guys as you

5126
05:21:22,324 --> 05:21:25,122
have. You can go to the lab,

5127
05:21:25,123 --> 05:21:27,991
just have some art. Assemble time.

5128
05:21:27,992 --> 05:21:30,671
And then it gives you your actual,

5129
05:21:30,994 --> 05:21:33,358
you know, parameters of what, the dimensions of what.

5130
05:21:34,086 --> 05:21:38,297
And then those kinds of work poorly. Now we can move this chart a

5131
05:21:38,298 --> 05:21:41,372
little bit. Try to be soft enough.

5132
05:21:43,154 --> 05:21:45,724
Just look at that version. You So the chart is based off of your

5133
05:21:45,725 --> 05:21:47,738
tier 1 tracks, and then,

5134
05:21:48,432 --> 05:21:53,001
first one on the label, and then your- lane

5135
05:21:53,002 --> 05:21:55,177
is into your strut length, it's up to there.

5136
05:21:55,293 --> 05:21:58,387
Yup. And then, buy it into a pilot,

5137
05:21:58,471 --> 05:22:01,334
so I can- big set it down to- Okay, a few one thousand,

5138
05:22:01,439 --> 05:22:03,560
and I can, yeah.

5139
05:22:04,017 --> 05:22:07,246
And then, wrong lane,

5140
05:22:07,362 --> 05:22:10,470
right side, so. So, So, there's all the pandas are in there,

5141
05:22:10,865 --> 05:22:14,511
and we can build this however we need to organize it,

5142
05:22:15,023 --> 05:22:19,560
and then I can also relabel. And all that really means for me to

5143
05:22:19,561 --> 05:22:21,602
kick off a job to say, hey, these are the, this is how we

5144
05:22:21,603 --> 05:22:26,601
can make a look. And that's how we can establish all of our actuals

5145
05:22:27,518 --> 05:22:31,672
of sizes to where kind of like our detailed standards of it.

5146
05:22:32,057 --> 05:22:34,972
Any . Just to say, p1000 tapping team,

5147
05:22:35,058 --> 05:22:37,308
you know, kind of fan. So, uhm.

5148
05:22:37,318 --> 05:22:39,451
So, um.

5149
05:22:39,462 --> 05:22:42,472
So. I don't see someone like it,

5150
05:22:42,473 --> 05:22:45,823
but yeah. Scroll back,

5151
05:22:45,824 --> 05:22:47,890
scroll back up to the, uhm,

5152
05:22:47,901 --> 05:22:51,067
so that. That's what's, it was in the surrounding,

5153
05:22:51,068 --> 05:22:54,407
right? Right. So the T1 EC1,

5154
05:22:54,408 --> 05:22:59,211
0, 0, 0. You is the whole same length?

5155
05:22:59,387 --> 05:23:01,474
Is that correct? Okay, well,

5156
05:23:01,475 --> 05:23:03,495
when you, you were to have not need to,

5157
05:23:03,496 --> 05:23:05,820
but if you're not, but if you're And if you can look at where

5158
05:23:05,821 --> 05:23:08,720
those are labeled out, we'll see that, that one's able to call it.

5159
05:23:08,721 --> 05:23:11,209
Okay. Sound of means that our symphony.

5160
05:23:11,434 --> 05:23:16,019
Okay. Okay. And then the components within

5161
05:23:16,020 --> 05:23:20,145
that are basically the rods on the happy trails.

5162
05:23:20,146 --> 05:23:20,551
on this.

5163
05:23:29,371 --> 05:23:31,945
That's it. That's incredible.

5164
05:23:32,411 --> 05:23:36,930
There is some instances where you would have three supporters on one strut

5165
05:23:36,931 --> 05:23:40,983
link. So. So, Yup. You don't actually see anything on the computer channel.

5166
05:23:41,150 --> 05:23:45,391
Sign up for worst days, but. This one really only had some R1 and-

5167
05:23:45,392 --> 05:23:47,447
R2, okay, wrong position. Yup.

5168
05:23:47,448 --> 05:23:51,240
I actually. Didn't think different.

5169
05:23:51,241 --> 05:23:53,866
Yeah. And either. You So basically.

5170
05:23:53,867 --> 05:23:58,462
actually like a standard one-inch this

5171
05:23:58,463 --> 05:24:02,775
one so basically we would be,

5172
05:24:02,776 --> 05:24:07,175
uhm,

5173
05:24:07,186 --> 05:24:10,090
you're talking about the, like, um, of that one Utah.

5174
05:24:10,091 --> 05:24:12,663
You talk. I'm talking about four simply,

5175
05:24:12,664 --> 05:24:15,209
so you got eight rounds out of two foot long.

5176
05:24:15,348 --> 05:24:17,500
That was an, uh, uh,

5177
05:24:17,510 --> 05:24:21,560
one's an, uh, two. So,

5178
05:24:21,561 --> 05:24:25,099
to give that in the tech line,

5179
05:24:25,100 --> 05:24:29,735
um. So,

5180
05:24:30,086 --> 05:24:32,659
required fields are quantity,

5181
05:24:32,660 --> 05:24:36,825
drawing number. We'll see you Made more,

5182
05:24:36,826 --> 05:24:39,917
piece more, description,

5183
05:24:39,955 --> 05:24:42,802
grade, and length. So.

5184
05:24:42,803 --> 05:24:45,096
Hello. That name is Assembly.

5185
05:24:45,486 --> 05:24:47,648
I'm thinking we're going to do a,

5186
05:24:47,649 --> 05:24:52,884
uhm. out. A

5187
05:24:52,885 --> 05:24:55,160
little label. To the strum,

5188
05:24:55,161 --> 05:24:57,938
it's instruct type. One of our biggest cereal.

5189
05:24:57,939 --> 05:25:00,391
Uhm, is that?

5190
05:25:00,392 --> 05:25:03,283
I got, bought it as used as a cut,

5191
05:25:03,284 --> 05:25:06,890
as that one is the next cut. That's gotta be cut,

5192
05:25:06,891 --> 05:25:11,642
personally. That's for Okay,

5193
05:25:11,643 --> 05:25:13,647
so,

5194
05:25:13,648 --> 05:25:16,320
uhh.

5195
05:25:16,321 --> 05:25:19,857
I'll see what I got in the technical terminology.

5196
05:25:19,858 --> 05:25:22,155
I'm thinking about the shortest maintenance,

5197
05:25:22,386 --> 05:25:24,396
right? And then you got,

5198
05:25:24,397 --> 05:25:27,940
an R learning an R2 as part of us.

5199
05:25:28,817 --> 05:25:32,441
But it can't be called an R2 because all of those,

5200
05:25:32,442 --> 05:25:35,572
are different, like, bubbles are different, and these are different lights.

5201
05:25:37,355 --> 05:25:40,416
Yeah, so, I would be,

5202
05:25:40,417 --> 05:25:44,406
ehm, ehm, ehm. And our action is zero,

5203
05:25:46,276 --> 05:25:48,391
zero, with your labels, two, zero,

5204
05:25:48,392 --> 05:25:50,705
So, uhm,

5205
05:25:50,715 --> 05:25:52,755
and then R1, and then 0, 0,

5206
05:25:52,756 --> 05:25:54,940
1, yeah, R1, 0,

5207
05:25:54,941 --> 05:25:57,081
0, 2, and then- I mean,

5208
05:25:57,082 --> 05:26:00,357
if any of you are in the same, same length of a R1 or

5209
05:26:00,358 --> 05:26:02,844
2, I guess you can technically change those,

5210
05:26:02,845 --> 05:26:05,258
but to keep them in the same way. I didn't believe on that,

5211
05:26:05,259 --> 05:26:08,617
I didn't seem to keep them huge per year.

5212
05:26:08,618 --> 05:26:11,545
So, technically, with what we have in our database,

5213
05:26:11,928 --> 05:26:15,572
we're going to let know what There are five database with the P1000s and

5214
05:26:15,573 --> 05:26:18,870
the standard raw. I hope they could be able to run this one.

5215
05:26:18,871 --> 05:26:21,063
We'll be happy in here. Yeah.

5216
05:26:21,291 --> 05:26:23,547
Yeah. Because while they're searching by ours, I can't.

5217
05:26:24,309 --> 05:26:26,541
Because I can create one of these assemblies,

5218
05:26:26,542 --> 05:26:30,920
uhh, uhh, better than they call me. I don't have a family for it.

5219
05:26:31,359 --> 05:26:35,636
I can't really decide the way that I can go through and combine all

5220
05:26:35,637 --> 05:26:38,947
the like links. Thanks. Yeah, to call a new program,

5221
05:26:39,196 --> 05:26:43,285
right? So, if, if there's a way within our nesting zone.

5222
05:26:43,286 --> 05:26:45,915
So, We can,

5223
05:26:46,263 --> 05:26:48,904
we can combine life lengths together.

5224
05:26:48,905 --> 05:26:52,471
Even though they'd be unique, we could still have our stuff like a bundle.

5225
05:26:52,472 --> 05:26:56,013
I mean, I mean, as you guys well look at,

5226
05:26:56,014 --> 05:27:00,451
you know, whatever, the quantities that we show up to go.

5227
05:27:00,452 --> 05:27:02,774
Others, they would just know and just say, okay,

5228
05:27:03,769 --> 05:27:06,324
I would put all my two foot lengths in on the pile,

5229
05:27:06,434 --> 05:27:08,491
and then as the assemblers come,

5230
05:27:08,492 --> 05:27:11,635
I'll say, okay, I need to make a T.Y.C.1, make sure the two foot

5231
05:27:12,122 --> 05:27:15,038
then ends full out of their R1 with two,

5232
05:27:15,039 --> 05:27:20,412
whether you're sending them away. Because what I'm trying to get away from

5233
05:27:20,733 --> 05:27:24,420
is, I'm trying to utilize R2.

5234
05:27:24,456 --> 05:27:27,050
Oh, I'm just gonna stick out because we have an immense mass.

5235
05:27:27,961 --> 05:27:30,262
To be able to round up all of our family lengths,

5236
05:27:30,263 --> 05:27:32,325
too. I'm trying to get to, like,

5237
05:27:32,326 --> 05:27:35,351
four, I think we're only going to be able to forget the little one.

5238
05:27:35,352 --> 05:27:39,608
Just to imagine, you know,

5239
05:27:39,609 --> 05:27:41,857
shot guys go. you know, some uh,

5240
05:27:41,868 --> 05:27:43,947
fraction marks of nutrition, infractions. Yeah.

5241
05:27:43,948 --> 05:27:46,015
Yeah. So, uh, yeah.

5242
05:27:46,016 --> 05:27:48,505
Uh, so but that's my..

5243
05:27:48,506 --> 05:27:51,419
how do you function? I will do the BLM when we export,

5244
05:27:51,420 --> 05:27:54,365
so we shouldn't technically have to deal with any of that,

5245
05:27:54,366 --> 05:27:56,491
but. Yes.

5246
05:27:56,492 --> 05:27:58,591
Well, the same material is the material type,

5247
05:27:58,592 --> 05:28:01,011
like the strut of the same material type of buttons.

5248
05:28:02,527 --> 05:28:04,536
Not always, but you're gonna have.

5249
05:28:04,537 --> 05:28:08,091
Releasing's are going to be typically done in,

5250
05:28:08,386 --> 05:28:10,614
like, by area. So, like,

5251
05:28:10,615 --> 05:28:13,992
across the area, so we're going to all be, It's kind of most stainless,

5252
05:28:14,002 --> 05:28:17,811
and then once you get into, you know, exterior it'll be galvanized or something

5253
05:28:17,812 --> 05:28:20,038
like that. So, will that later be in this table,

5254
05:28:20,039 --> 05:28:22,381
or? Is that given globally or somewhere else?

5255
05:28:22,716 --> 05:28:26,323
We wouldn't, I would assume that when I define my strut type,

5256
05:28:26,324 --> 05:28:28,531
we wouldn't expand it out. So, just keep.

5257
05:28:28,532 --> 05:28:31,177
The actual P1000 number.

5258
05:28:31,308 --> 05:28:33,533
Okay. And then there would be, like, a P1000.

5259
05:28:33,534 --> 05:28:35,843
And that's true. Yeah.

5260
05:28:35,974 --> 05:28:38,793
And then that would- I'd be able to find into the debris flowless traps

5261
05:28:38,794 --> 05:28:42,439
from all the industry. Correct. Okay. What about the uhh,

5262
05:28:42,440 --> 05:28:44,551
uhh, rods? Well, that's Hold on.

5263
05:28:44,552 --> 05:28:48,019
They always the same thing or a certain different types of material for the

5264
05:28:48,020 --> 05:28:51,055
unit element. You have different grades available.

5265
05:28:51,056 --> 05:28:53,581
Okay. That's correct. All right. So,

5266
05:28:53,582 --> 05:28:56,601
you know, we're gonna need to be rock, rock that's in there as the

5267
05:28:56,602 --> 05:28:59,343
shape, and then create a Just do it.

5268
05:29:00,123 --> 05:29:02,425
Shit. . . You should already,

5269
05:29:02,426 --> 05:29:07,036
I'll show you. You already security. I'm not talking about We

5270
05:29:07,037 --> 05:29:09,712
were doing like, the almost a trade rap. I'm probably gonna be the only

5271
05:29:09,713 --> 05:29:12,070
one that is the best. Yeah. Right, so.

5272
05:29:12,755 --> 05:29:16,536
And again, it's kind of, we were doing it to your horizons.

5273
05:29:16,537 --> 05:29:19,644
I had some that we were designing within Revit,

5274
05:29:20,210 --> 05:29:24,571
which the design of the unit of the Revits is very simple.

5275
05:29:24,572 --> 05:29:28,523
Everything, all your text pieces are all kind of hard of a handling.

5276
05:29:28,524 --> 05:29:31,038
Uhm,

5277
05:29:31,048 --> 05:29:35,157
but it was a pain. And we needed these guys to actually propagate them,

5278
05:29:35,692 --> 05:29:38,159
and it was kind of uh,

5279
05:29:38,170 --> 05:29:40,591
they're treated as a structure component that they're designing.

5280
05:29:40,592 --> 05:29:43,446
Yeah, they did. Um,

5281
05:29:43,457 --> 05:29:46,161
and so we did a lot. That's where I think the database subscribed.

5282
05:29:47,028 --> 05:29:50,739
Pretty messy for those students. Some. you within running and I was doing something

5283
05:29:50,740 --> 05:29:55,261
within, you know, uhm, I actually advanced the old majority of the

5284
05:29:55,262 --> 05:30:00,341
students once. Alright. Is that some advanced deal with this actual

5285
05:30:00,342 --> 05:30:02,549
student? Actually, yeah,

5286
05:30:02,550 --> 05:30:04,591
it's uh, it's like, it's actual student.

5287
05:30:04,592 --> 05:30:06,603
Yeah,

5288
05:30:06,604 --> 05:30:08,614
it uh,

5289
05:30:08,615 --> 05:30:10,859
like, well,

5290
05:30:10,860 --> 05:30:15,252
with here, here. Spiderality over here,

5291
05:30:15,253 --> 05:30:17,476
intro is right over here.

5292
05:30:20,616 --> 05:30:23,162
I kind of just stuck it out there and said,

5293
05:30:23,163 --> 05:30:25,330
we're not doing anything. We're just going to you know, geez,

5294
05:30:25,331 --> 05:30:27,856
they're buying. Exactly. But it's,

5295
05:30:27,857 --> 05:30:30,376
it's real. It's, it's just like within,

5296
05:30:30,570 --> 05:30:33,650
like, techno structure. You can build families out and do the same thing within

5297
05:30:33,651 --> 05:30:35,959
the auto settings. It, it's set up,

5298
05:30:35,960 --> 05:30:38,080
right? It works. Straight, but, uh,

5299
05:30:38,090 --> 05:30:41,798
they're talking about, uh, and the wiping it and cutting it into a plug-in

5300
05:30:41,799 --> 05:30:44,616
for a bit. Yeah. So, that statement.

5301
05:30:44,617 --> 05:30:46,901
That's awesome. It's not a long way.

5302
05:30:46,902 --> 05:30:51,616
Other issues, uhm, but, You're going to

5303
05:30:51,617 --> 05:30:54,068
get 100% It's easy on me.

5304
05:30:54,069 --> 05:30:57,080
I said, okay, I'm in here. And they, you know, they're cleaning out so

5305
05:30:57,081 --> 05:30:59,636
you just have one specific call off for each.

5306
05:31:00,004 --> 05:31:02,500
See ya. Don't. Just because we have,

5307
05:31:02,501 --> 05:31:05,446
I mean, one and five eighths back at the back, one and five eighths,

5308
05:31:05,447 --> 05:31:08,611
one and five eighths solid, and then one thousand.

5309
05:31:08,612 --> 05:31:10,971
And it's P1000,

5310
05:31:10,972 --> 05:31:13,022
so. Well, that's, yeah.

5311
05:31:13,647 --> 05:31:19,639
That part of our actual kickoff was- you technically they're all always- they're

5312
05:31:19,640 --> 05:31:21,733
all very similar in the P1000s,

5313
05:31:21,734 --> 05:31:24,600
but you have action unistrattics different than- .

5314
05:31:24,631 --> 05:31:28,288
That's Ph.D. Coughles, I come to do their so different manufacturers.

5315
05:31:28,289 --> 05:31:30,543
So they're ... they're ... they're ... they're ... someone ever change the world

5316
05:31:30,544 --> 05:31:34,247
but also kind of limited with specs. Thanks. But actually,

5317
05:31:34,248 --> 05:31:40,064
I definitely, that's something easier to clean up on how we do that.

5318
05:31:40,065 --> 05:31:43,629
Yeah. So, it's definitely really good. Thanks for having us figure that out.

5319
05:31:43,630 --> 05:31:46,380
We're starting to figure out how to deal with these on the ground.

5320
05:31:46,385 --> 05:31:48,631
That's the meaning of it. It's kind of like, it's my time.

5321
05:31:48,632 --> 05:31:52,704
Because I've got to figure out on how to do what's available and what

5322
05:31:52,705 --> 05:31:55,583
we can leverage from Revit. I think you just need to start it from

5323
05:31:55,584 --> 05:31:57,661
what tech will, Except,

5324
05:31:57,715 --> 05:32:00,852
yeah, I can build the U.S. into a company.

5325
05:32:00,853 --> 05:32:05,717
So, go and see if you can, back around

5326
05:32:05,718 --> 05:32:09,065
here to get close to this, and then technically use your system instead of

5327
05:32:09,066 --> 05:32:12,696
bottom. And then,

5328
05:32:12,697 --> 05:32:15,025
Search for, uh,

5329
05:32:15,036 --> 05:32:16,422
excellular work inputs. words.

5330
05:32:21,571 --> 05:32:26,505
There may be more to production

5331
05:32:26,506 --> 05:32:36,819
control in E.C. See you soon. So,

5332
05:32:36,820 --> 05:32:41,270
the- How all of these fields are needed?

5333
05:32:42,254 --> 05:32:46,491
You can tell I'm aware of you want to, but don't remember being marked,

5334
05:32:46,492 --> 05:32:50,152
peaceful. I don't know. That's not gonna be required.

5335
05:32:52,747 --> 05:32:55,416
So, if you get into this format,

5336
05:32:55,417 --> 05:32:59,895
Maybe you'll be able to do it where you're shaping the bench,

5337
05:32:59,896 --> 05:33:03,003
you're in the same field. I think there's a good form of type for

5338
05:33:03,004 --> 05:33:06,888
that. So, if it's not split out of shape with the bench,

5339
05:33:06,889 --> 05:33:09,553
it's separate. But, ah,

5340
05:33:09,711 --> 05:33:12,270
I guess you're really not in fine shape. In the story,

5341
05:33:12,271 --> 05:33:15,400
she gave me my heart, so. No, I mean, those would be fine down

5342
05:33:15,401 --> 05:33:17,671
to just, yeah.

5343
05:33:17,672 --> 05:33:19,897
Umm, you know, struggle. Umm, or, ah. So,

5344
05:33:21,500 --> 05:33:25,189
that's, that's pretty much it that you can use in the other fields that

5345
05:33:25,190 --> 05:33:27,576
you want to, like you want in chemicals.

5346
05:33:27,577 --> 05:33:30,120
But that, so,

5347
05:33:30,121 --> 05:33:35,611
I wouldn't make a mistake.

5348
05:33:35,612 --> 05:33:40,266
I have seen the spirit, the drawing and main board piece mark

5349
05:33:40,552 --> 05:33:43,875
will be decided. And the strut will be- you know,

5350
05:33:43,876 --> 05:33:45,966
I'm going to go and see what it is.

5351
05:33:46,358 --> 05:33:50,678
And then your rides will be going down the main board to be the

5352
05:33:50,679 --> 05:33:54,234
safest strut. Bye! It's not a case mark of the R1's,

5353
05:33:54,235 --> 05:33:56,622
you know, you can bridge it somehow.

5354
05:33:56,623 --> 05:33:59,736
It's hard one to actually hear what you want to do with it.

5355
05:33:59,737 --> 05:34:02,221
And, ah,

5356
05:34:02,222 --> 05:34:04,474
shit, a lot of me. I mean, we can go off here and get

5357
05:34:04,499 --> 05:34:06,523
here and just, in,

5358
05:34:06,524 --> 05:34:08,887
or in, and see what happens. If that works,

5359
05:34:08,894 --> 05:34:12,708
it will go for good. Yeah. Take that.

5360
05:34:12,709 --> 05:34:19,809
. . If

5361
05:34:19,810 --> 05:34:22,312
you have, uh, an export, then you know,

5362
05:34:23,022 --> 05:34:27,507
get me You want to just pick one line on top of that?

5363
05:34:28,042 --> 05:34:33,277
Draw them in the middle of the line? Good. Yeah,

5364
05:34:33,278 --> 05:34:35,559
like that. P1, c1, uu,

5365
05:34:35,560 --> 05:34:36,145
uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh.

5366
05:34:48,571 --> 05:34:52,772
Coming up with, and this might be too much work,

5367
05:34:52,773 --> 05:34:56,099
but it was something I was just thinking about. It I think,

5368
05:34:56,100 --> 05:35:01,016
possibly. I agree. I don't should say within some

5369
05:35:01,017 --> 05:35:04,596
structure I could create a kiss out that would be defined as me.

5370
05:35:04,597 --> 05:35:09,176
One of those assemblies, and then create that as

5371
05:35:09,177 --> 05:35:12,487
a body and figure out just some way of manipulating my own kiss.

5372
05:35:12,488 --> 05:35:16,035
It's fine. Well, essentially with the links and then just using that as just

5373
05:35:16,036 --> 05:35:18,949
a single import. Oh, and, uh,

5374
05:35:18,959 --> 05:35:21,181
I wasn't worried too much about trying to- Of course,

5375
05:35:21,182 --> 05:35:24,289
you get a kiss file. Really, in my mind,

5376
05:35:24,290 --> 05:35:27,291
you get a kiss file, and that's it. There's none.

5377
05:35:28,342 --> 05:35:31,890
Bye So, if the exhale makes it each year,

5378
05:35:31,891 --> 05:35:34,261
then I'll just use the exhale.

5379
05:35:34,366 --> 05:35:37,914
Cause once, I think, what's nice to do is- 1 Then we get that

5380
05:35:37,915 --> 05:35:41,453
situation where building some sort of a field change,

5381
05:35:41,472 --> 05:35:43,844
right? And then we have a, uhm, like, a sort of, uhm,

5382
05:35:44,616 --> 05:35:47,554
the blank ordering system, we lift the guys and then spill out,

5383
05:35:47,555 --> 05:35:50,401
you know, length, width, height, whatever, and then just send it in to A.

5384
05:35:50,402 --> 05:35:52,645
I, you know, Jimmy's script.

5385
05:35:52,646 --> 05:35:55,179
. of the design, so I need 30 of these water,

5386
05:35:55,503 --> 05:35:58,708
right? And then we can just let it back in here,

5387
05:35:58,709 --> 05:36:01,701
and we can type in and export. Squirt. Yeah.

5388
05:36:05,242 --> 05:36:09,696
Alright, you're looking to,

5389
05:36:09,697 --> 05:36:12,226
Do estimates for this sit here as well?

5390
05:36:12,227 --> 05:36:15,624
Um, at this point,

5391
05:36:16,915 --> 05:36:19,279
probably no. So the way that,

5392
05:36:20,058 --> 05:36:22,976
the way that election was estimated, uhm,

5393
05:36:22,987 --> 05:36:24,676
they actually have a pretty,

5394
05:36:33,691 --> 05:36:37,510
The field is the kind of way there is main software works.

5395
05:36:37,734 --> 05:36:40,445
They just put it on parameters that we can support over 60,

5396
05:36:40,446 --> 05:36:47,509
and draw a conduit run. So, but in what would actually

5397
05:36:47,551 --> 05:36:49,711
be the long term.

5398
05:36:49,712 --> 05:36:53,903
Some of it would be nice, would be from a project management standpoint.

5399
05:36:53,967 --> 05:36:57,691
We'd be able to actually, to be able to come up with real estate.

5400
05:37:00,855 --> 05:37:04,526
Yeah, so you're not going to blow the load of them.

5401
05:37:04,527 --> 05:37:16,287
Yeah, kind of. Maybe not. Bye. So,

5402
05:37:16,288 --> 05:37:21,287
uh.

5403
05:37:22,651 --> 05:37:24,739
I'm not a man, I'm not a person. So,

5404
05:37:25,105 --> 05:37:28,290
if we look at them to create the cut of this,

5405
05:37:29,434 --> 05:37:30,691
and what not, we- You

5406
05:37:38,676 --> 05:37:41,075
Yeah, almost 100% of the time.

5407
05:37:41,076 --> 05:37:43,566
I don't like throwing up with that.

5408
05:37:43,713 --> 05:37:48,325
It would be um. So, we'll see you I can believe my look out

5409
05:37:48,326 --> 05:37:52,144
of the options. I'm talking about for licensing.

5410
05:37:52,145 --> 05:37:54,233
Umm, you can really have one,

5411
05:37:54,234 --> 05:37:57,452
sorry. All right. I'm going to go inside,

5412
05:37:58,082 --> 05:38:00,454
cover, or share with her.

5413
05:38:00,455 --> 05:38:05,373
Yeah, I shouldn't cover I'm going to call it Fortanities in

5414
05:38:05,374 --> 05:38:09,581
the airport. Umm,

5415
05:38:09,592 --> 05:38:12,277
so I'm going to get to you. I'm leave them on the other edge

5416
05:38:12,278 --> 05:38:16,408
side. They're probably a little separate.

5417
05:38:16,573 --> 05:38:18,696
Yeah, I'll go separate some now. Yeah. Yeah.

5418
05:38:18,552 --> 05:38:23,410
Yeah. But I believe they're,

5419
05:38:24,720 --> 05:38:29,362
they're almost safe. They're operating. All right. I don't think

5420
05:38:29,363 --> 05:38:34,420
they would actually know.

5421
05:38:33,485 --> 05:38:37,478
No. But if you want two different databases,

5422
05:38:37,573 --> 05:38:40,869
then, um, currently get a new,

5423
05:38:41,422 --> 05:38:43,848
you're getting signed up there. . . . . this your with radiation can

5424
05:38:43,869 --> 05:38:47,077
only point to one of the databases, it can't really be heard or warned.

5425
05:38:47,078 --> 05:38:49,649
. . And the dynamics are just another integral that I'm at this standpoint.

5426
05:38:49,650 --> 05:38:51,768
. . Um- . . Yeah,

5427
05:38:51,769 --> 05:38:53,876
like, I mean, if we want to sit right,

5428
05:38:53,877 --> 05:38:56,963
sit right back in all three shots, right? And you want your own leg.

5429
05:38:56,964 --> 05:39:00,331
Here's all my job, very good. And that's going to be a totally different

5430
05:39:00,332 --> 05:39:02,367
day. I switched to what we were trying to do.

5431
05:39:02,377 --> 05:39:04,466
I opened up a lot. And I,

5432
05:39:04,816 --> 05:39:07,869
I mean. Thank you. I would say,

5433
05:39:09,159 --> 05:39:11,726
I mean, I can't really be feeling the same. You know,

5434
05:39:11,727 --> 05:39:15,418
they're all question coordinators, but it would be just- You know,

5435
05:39:15,658 --> 05:39:20,552
would be easy to have an electric coordinator operating the same

5436
05:39:21,034 --> 05:39:23,282
zone as them, or the same as- 7 and then,

5437
05:39:23,283 --> 05:39:27,115
uhh, it's no reason it should be modding either.

5438
05:39:27,429 --> 05:39:30,751
Or if we can just send it to these guys.

5439
05:39:30,752 --> 05:39:33,226
And then they can produce the cutlets.

5440
05:39:33,276 --> 05:39:35,871
And then it just gets, it gets routed to,

5441
05:39:36,048 --> 05:39:39,185
you know, they like it with you. Right? And then, uhh, uhh, We kind

5442
05:39:39,186 --> 05:39:42,621
of executed her later. Yeah,

5443
05:39:42,622 --> 05:39:44,816
it's an essential need to develop all of you to the same server server.

5444
05:39:44,817 --> 05:39:48,822
I'm not one of those guys. That's what we're doing in the issues.

5445
05:39:49,486 --> 05:39:52,369
I'm nothing. But there's no reason,

5446
05:39:52,370 --> 05:39:56,851
especially if the size is defined. spine. We have to create college for all

5447
05:39:56,852 --> 05:40:01,319
the jobs and their enemies to find more help from everything.

5448
05:40:01,716 --> 05:40:03,925
And. and And then,

5449
05:40:03,926 --> 05:40:06,173
you can't be able to more, you can't go less than that.

5450
05:40:06,174 --> 05:40:09,583
You can use it over there to access the compost to see if it's

5451
05:40:09,584 --> 05:40:13,292
even here. Yeah. Yeah. Just go do it. I can see it here,

5452
05:40:13,293 --> 05:40:18,533
but I think it hurts. It is,

5453
05:40:18,534 --> 05:40:22,465
it is okay. It's like, but, yeah. It'll come with its own kick up,

5454
05:40:22,466 --> 05:40:25,880
so I'm sure. Yeah. But, I mean, I don't know whether it's hurting.

5455
05:40:25,881 --> 05:40:28,790
All right. With our current workflow and everything like that,

5456
05:40:28,791 --> 05:40:33,607
I would see this. I don't need maybe one towel over it that was

5457
05:40:33,740 --> 05:40:38,448
for, and in just, We'll you in me. Yeah, my opponent just have control

5458
05:40:38,449 --> 05:40:41,511
over it and he was being dug into the back.

5459
05:40:41,512 --> 05:40:44,229
God is his. Teams. As he goes into an outcome team.

5460
05:40:44,230 --> 05:40:49,294
Now you want to do umm,

5461
05:40:49,305 --> 05:40:54,875
like, ehm. You want to try

5462
05:40:54,876 --> 05:40:58,345
other things within the system after cutting your,

5463
05:40:58,346 --> 05:41:01,939
uhh, try- I have to shake me a little bit of my heart there.

5464
05:41:02,434 --> 05:41:05,934
Ideally, yeah, we'd, we would have to,

5465
05:41:06,174 --> 05:41:08,942
you know, cause we're going to break me. We'll see We're going to break

5466
05:41:08,943 --> 05:41:11,256
things down into, like, separate work packages,

5467
05:41:11,257 --> 05:41:14,816
so you'll have, you know, this, you won't even spread out across,

5468
05:41:14,894 --> 05:41:18,875
you know, and settle. And so the guys working,

5469
05:41:18,876 --> 05:41:21,840
you know, in area one.

5470
05:41:22,396 --> 05:41:26,698
Bye It'll be shipped out as an area of one back.

5471
05:41:26,699 --> 05:41:31,711
It'll check for it. I'm trying to keep it bundled to where it,

5472
05:41:31,712 --> 05:41:34,600
,directly goes to site and stage to that area. It won't have to shake

5473
05:41:34,601 --> 05:41:37,096
everything out. It'll be in a secret,

5474
05:41:37,097 --> 05:41:39,751
so it's fast, but it'll be in the end.

5475
05:41:39,752 --> 05:41:44,300
And that's kind of how we're setting up.

5476
05:41:44,301 --> 05:41:47,731
That's how we're kind of setting up a plane need any way.

5477
05:41:47,732 --> 05:41:52,641
We have that work package so, so correlating them backwards from

5478
05:41:52,642 --> 05:41:55,771
our, our take-off. Uh-oh. Go.

5479
05:41:54,928 --> 05:41:59,756
Go. Cause we're obviously just been learning like what you're doing within

5480
05:42:00,010 --> 05:42:02,339
structures and as far as like that. Once it goes,

5481
05:42:02,340 --> 05:42:04,607
it gets claimed and kind of builds it. All right,

5482
05:42:04,931 --> 05:42:08,144
so we're using that same, they call it acid track,

5483
05:42:08,145 --> 05:42:10,941
but it's the same concept that I did. And,

5484
05:42:11,543 --> 05:42:14,165
it was. Wouldn't be that when the muscle work back is great and it'll

5485
05:42:14,190 --> 05:42:16,604
automatically create something you want to make some of this.

5486
05:42:16,704 --> 05:42:19,201
Yeah, we bring, we could bring them in as separate lots.

5487
05:42:19,202 --> 05:42:21,529
Bye, guys. And combine them as lots.

5488
05:42:21,530 --> 05:42:24,341
Yeah. And then still get the efficiency out,

5489
05:42:24,342 --> 05:42:27,042
so it'll be able to track it separately.

5490
05:42:27,043 --> 05:42:32,235
Perfectly. So

5491
05:42:32,236 --> 05:42:34,826
do you just try to get them in like, uh,

5492
05:42:34,827 --> 05:42:46,308
uh, like, ehm, well. you I

5493
05:42:46,309 --> 05:42:49,602
keep 20 out of there and went typical that I've been getting in.

5494
05:42:50,857 --> 05:42:55,424
Now I'm over to pasta. Thank you. So we gotta set that up in

5495
05:42:55,662 --> 05:43:00,219
the, yeah, first of the maintenance and all

5496
05:43:00,220 --> 05:43:02,618
of that. We have get the lights in there.

5497
05:43:05,976 --> 05:43:09,975
You don't have any bits. The fast ones we have are in order,

5498
05:43:09,976 --> 05:43:11,270
yeah. That's Yeah. No.

5499
05:43:18,511 --> 05:43:20,743
It's a great,

5500
05:43:20,757 --> 05:43:23,085
it's not a good area. Or is that great to use? use.

5501
05:43:26,551 --> 05:43:29,805
We've got a number of grades in there.

5502
05:43:30,708 --> 05:43:33,210
You get to have down with the bottom of the middle of the middle

5503
05:43:33,211 --> 05:43:37,918
of the grade, too. You If you leave that

5504
05:43:37,919 --> 05:43:40,487
blank, you're bringing all the grades that are set up.

5505
05:43:40,488 --> 05:44:14,410
Sure. Good job. .

5506
05:44:14,411 --> 05:44:19,008
I'm I'm going to do. Thank you.

5507
05:44:19,009 --> 05:44:25,020
Thank you That's This

5508
05:44:25,021 --> 05:44:31,141
actually will work really well. And then

5509
05:44:31,142 --> 05:44:35,791
so essentially, everything. There it is. I really wouldn't be predesigned out or

5510
05:44:35,792 --> 05:44:38,690
our families weekend.

5511
05:44:39,455 --> 05:44:45,023
I can further. and get

5512
05:44:45,024 --> 05:44:47,676
it where we're going to get it to wash it once. Yeah. Yeah.

5513
05:44:47,677 --> 05:44:54,458
Yeah. So it's

5514
05:44:54,459 --> 05:44:57,672
all, you know, what, what, what happens when we,

5515
05:44:57,673 --> 05:45:02,892
So, once, what,

5516
05:45:02,893 --> 05:45:05,707
the urban urban urban community.

5517
05:45:05,708 --> 05:45:05,883
Thank you.

5518
05:46:35,491 --> 05:46:38,965
I don't think we had a 40-foot you can comment on it right now.

5519
05:46:40,045 --> 05:46:43,744
But it's a 40-foot piece and a 1-8th grand market and- Okay,

5520
05:46:43,745 --> 05:46:46,203
someone back up here.

5521
05:46:48,098 --> 05:46:50,414
You know, yeah, it's the one thought of the church.

5522
05:46:50,415 --> 05:46:55,169
Yeah. Yeah. It's just a small one about who we're bringing

5523
05:46:55,170 --> 05:46:59,547
back. Okay, a couple more.

5524
05:47:07,651 --> 05:47:11,276
I want to come with you guys and like it to Thank you.

5525
05:47:23,851 --> 05:47:28,431
No.

5526
05:47:28,432 --> 05:47:35,649
No. No. No. Okay.

5527
05:47:36,504 --> 05:47:40,731
Now I'm ready to listen. So I can continue.

5528
05:47:40,732 --> 05:47:43,394
You You, you, you said you can write,

5529
05:47:43,395 --> 05:47:46,922
uh, uhm, the graphics and you'll get out of this format.

5530
05:47:47,421 --> 05:47:56,923
Yeah, the only thing I'm not gonna- Yeah,

5531
05:47:56,924 --> 05:48:00,817
and and the worst worst case any end come up with the,

5532
05:48:00,818 --> 05:48:04,183
the way the massage the data become.

5533
05:48:04,184 --> 05:48:07,269
Well, we'll see from around the next port.

5534
05:48:07,270 --> 05:48:10,542
You can just do some pretty basic itself up and then,

5535
05:48:10,543 --> 05:48:13,480
yeah, get it into this one now. Yeah,

5536
05:48:13,481 --> 05:48:17,119
I'm moving. You can just sort of excuse where you take it.

5537
05:48:17,120 --> 05:48:19,415
Uh, you know, AI,

5538
05:48:19,416 --> 05:48:21,871
you know, kennel. Or one kennel.

5539
05:48:21,872 --> 05:48:26,749
Append those splashing images of the drawing.

5540
05:48:26,750 --> 05:48:30,871
Okay, it's.

5541
05:48:30,872 --> 05:48:33,624
Yeah, that's, that's probably the,

5542
05:48:34,825 --> 05:48:37,186
the easiest of the day. They have this.

5543
05:48:38,493 --> 05:48:43,009
But yeah, because- I'm really pleased to know

5544
05:48:43,010 --> 05:48:45,862
that. Be in what you want.

5545
05:48:47,243 --> 05:48:50,171
Very helpful. I think I'm gonna get the final note,

5546
05:48:50,172 --> 05:48:53,871
because that wasn't gonna happen.

5547
05:48:53,872 --> 05:48:56,191
Yeah, I'm gonna be great with the differentiate.

5548
05:48:56,192 --> 05:48:59,946
So, you know, the same as a hot kit,

5549
05:49:00,272 --> 05:49:03,511
you know, the same as your old hands.

5550
05:49:03,512 --> 05:49:08,037
That means, So, and I'm sure your simple implicates in the

5551
05:49:08,038 --> 05:49:12,276
area. Wait, honestly, I-I feel you don't want to have the touch.

5552
05:49:12,277 --> 05:49:14,358
What it comes out of. Yeah,

5553
05:49:14,374 --> 05:49:19,404
and I'm gonna have pizza bowl that is, but you can-some

5554
05:49:19,405 --> 05:49:23,968
have a five-ringer. . What's the game gonna have

5555
05:49:23,969 --> 05:49:26,810
to do that so I don't want it to, yeah.

5556
05:49:26,811 --> 05:49:29,689
But, that's it. It's. I don't see that scene.

5557
05:49:29,690 --> 05:49:31,944
It should be more easily set up.

5558
05:49:31,945 --> 05:49:36,391
I know. Yeah, okay. I don't see.

5559
05:49:36,392 --> 05:49:37,858
. I think we didn't listen at all. All

5560
05:49:52,471 --> 05:49:56,113
It's really not the only thing you need to try.

5561
05:49:56,250 --> 05:49:58,470
I thought it was the pattern of it. And,

5562
05:49:59,641 --> 05:50:01,951
shit, you got Well, I would say,

5563
05:50:02,206 --> 05:50:04,595
you have the purchase and the first thing you see,

5564
05:50:04,596 --> 05:50:06,717
uhm, and then,

5565
05:50:06,718 --> 05:50:09,809
yes, cutting. Thank joining me. Cutting,

5566
05:50:09,810 --> 05:50:12,086
you know, probably have the same sort of,

5567
05:50:12,234 --> 05:50:14,592
you know, uh, QCE.

5568
05:50:15,039 --> 05:50:17,434
Yeah, we're having a coating on it. And then,

5569
05:50:17,507 --> 05:50:20,814
you know, shipping, you to be one of them.

5570
05:50:21,036 --> 05:50:23,555
That receiving field of past arrival,

5571
05:50:23,595 --> 05:50:25,862
are some of these? Made here, or there,

5572
05:50:25,863 --> 05:50:28,320
or in the field. The assemblage would be made,

5573
05:50:28,321 --> 05:50:30,357
uh, at, here, at,

5574
05:50:30,358 --> 05:50:32,671
uh, depth and fat shop. With some of those.

5575
05:50:32,672 --> 05:50:36,296
I saw you have bean clams for that.

5576
05:50:36,297 --> 05:50:38,685
So, the bean clams,

5577
05:50:40,711 --> 05:50:43,942
I probably just take this further down.

5578
05:50:43,943 --> 05:50:48,756
Um, the way that they do their ordering is,

5579
05:50:48,757 --> 05:50:51,225
They just do a vulgar word, sensitive,

5580
05:50:51,226 --> 05:50:54,759
beginning, but then the vendor does a min-max kind of thing,

5581
05:50:54,760 --> 05:50:56,919
so I would just say, uh, like that. I'm to go ahead that,

5582
05:50:56,920 --> 05:51:01,015
uh, as your assembler is pulling all their stuff,

5583
05:51:01,331 --> 05:51:03,545
they just know that they're gearing up for this assembly, starting to go. Oh,

5584
05:51:03,546 --> 05:51:05,587
no. Well, that's I'm to have a little bit, you know,

5585
05:51:05,621 --> 05:51:08,519
I know, I mean, 100 days, I'm gonna pull 400 nuts,

5586
05:51:08,777 --> 05:51:13,863
kinda thing, based off of what. But that is so- You I

5587
05:51:14,065 --> 05:51:16,379
think you could love it a further. I just don't know if,

5588
05:51:17,200 --> 05:51:19,546
yeah, that might be taking a load.

5589
05:51:20,164 --> 05:51:24,774
Two. All right. Do you

5590
05:51:24,775 --> 05:51:27,236
want, uhh, do you want to try?

5591
05:51:27,237 --> 05:51:31,842
All right. How

5592
05:51:31,843 --> 05:51:33,224
did he have got a symbol of how did he have not, or just

5593
05:51:33,733 --> 05:51:36,294
felt that, yeah, I'm really distracting.

5594
05:51:36,295 --> 05:51:41,216
and caring for you. Because we're going to be breaking

5595
05:51:41,217 --> 05:51:44,269
the work packages, I think we would want to be tracking told as long

5596
05:51:44,270 --> 05:51:46,754
as it's being. Thank you. Don't look at the net spread across.

5597
05:51:47,412 --> 05:51:50,288
So you do want to be able to track completion based off of,

5598
05:51:50,289 --> 05:51:53,071
uh, air in the lab convention. Thank you very much.

5599
05:51:53,072 --> 05:51:55,385
So,

5600
05:51:55,386 --> 05:51:59,714
probably right off the page. Yeah,

5601
05:51:59,715 --> 05:52:01,809
one more simple company. See you later. Some work.

5602
05:52:01,810 --> 05:52:04,231
Yeah. Uhm. And then,

5603
05:52:04,271 --> 05:52:07,983
you know, for the walk of the track, the completion of the assembly,

5604
05:52:07,984 --> 05:52:11,736
is that a QC? See You know, if you have a station in there,

5605
05:52:11,737 --> 05:52:14,514
or a 78, and then you have an inspection,

5606
05:52:14,898 --> 05:52:17,191
and then you fill out the inspection, you'll work with it.

5607
05:52:17,089 --> 05:52:19,302
It is going to be a, uh,

5608
05:52:19,313 --> 05:52:23,135
more efficient job. Yeah, I'm going to just do it in the first article

5609
05:52:23,136 --> 05:52:25,236
on the section, and then I'll like, uh, uh, very good.

5610
05:52:25,237 --> 05:52:27,832
So, kind of thing, but, uh,

5611
05:52:27,843 --> 05:52:31,439
but, and then it's going to globally go through that.

5612
05:52:32,287 --> 05:52:34,305
See, uh, yeah, yeah. I'm the, I'm gonna just send a prayer to a

5613
05:52:34,306 --> 05:52:37,131
lot like we did for, for cold hands,

5614
05:52:37,132 --> 05:52:39,191
cause I'm gonna keep going in the peace track here.

5615
05:52:39,517 --> 05:52:42,935
And it's gonna randomly add, complete em. And move back to the weather.

5616
05:52:43,184 --> 05:52:45,643
And it's, it's gonna be,

5617
05:52:45,957 --> 05:52:50,118
yes, uhm. See I got a good stuff.

5618
05:52:51,057 --> 05:52:54,405
That's, that's a good issue, you know. I can say it should be a

5619
05:52:54,406 --> 05:52:58,377
yes. Umm, yeah. So, yeah. I'm going a little it's just going to be

5620
05:52:58,378 --> 05:53:01,156
getting an impact than the format of getting an impact.

5621
05:53:02,028 --> 05:53:03,020
It's only the hardest thing. See you

5622
05:53:13,471 --> 05:53:17,185
We, could we create a wrap and we'll just say like,

5623
05:53:18,884 --> 05:53:21,516
we just call it electrical assembly or we'll just leave it falling.

5624
05:53:21,517 --> 05:53:26,538
I mean, we need to create a wrap and you can have some electrical

5625
05:53:26,539 --> 05:53:29,300
stuff. Or we'll just, we'll just, we'll just make more sense just to kind

5626
05:53:29,301 --> 05:53:31,483
of create. Thank you. I mean, I mean,

5627
05:53:31,484 --> 05:53:35,341
why don't we just fit up and,

5628
05:53:35,342 --> 05:53:37,991
yeah. You it's,

5629
05:53:37,992 --> 05:53:42,101
we have, these are all of our routes that we have here.

5630
05:53:42,102 --> 05:53:45,508
Uh, uhm, uhm, these are all uhm.

5631
05:53:45,636 --> 05:53:49,168
I've got, uhm, a bit of a little bit on me,

5632
05:53:49,504 --> 05:53:53,345
so, uhm, so we can just tailor one of these.

5633
05:53:53,346 --> 05:53:57,339
is a great new one for electrical engineering,

5634
05:53:57,340 --> 05:53:59,599
uhm, okay. Okay.

5635
05:53:59,600 --> 05:54:04,599
Does

5636
05:54:15,344 --> 05:54:18,991
the costing have people all up in a specific way or can you just-

5637
05:54:18,992 --> 05:54:23,997
control a lot under company 40 through 700

5638
05:54:23,998 --> 05:54:26,114
here at this stage? Uh,

5639
05:54:26,124 --> 05:54:30,733
we win. you So, I think you would treat this the

5640
05:54:30,734 --> 05:54:34,249
same way that we're kind of doing now is that.

5641
05:54:34,250 --> 05:54:38,795
Yeah. We, we would actually do combining and that would

5642
05:54:39,121 --> 05:54:42,673
take the electrical repair and then they would just tell us the,

5643
05:54:42,786 --> 05:54:46,307
You know that they cut out for that and then it would be out

5644
05:54:46,308 --> 05:54:49,446
of the system here in case of it.

5645
05:54:50,334 --> 05:54:53,202
I don't know. So at least the way it currently set up is,

5646
05:54:53,334 --> 05:54:56,075
is they have an item. I mean,

5647
05:54:56,076 --> 05:54:58,400
because it's still, it's all under 40.

5648
05:54:58,323 --> 05:55:00,573
Sorry. Um, but it's still,

5649
05:55:00,574 --> 05:55:02,791
it's two different divisions. It's kind of a thing.

5650
05:55:02,792 --> 05:55:05,361
It just did. And,

5651
05:55:05,362 --> 05:55:08,628
even Marvin kissed the caronist ride. Sometimes you probably need to use this.

5652
05:55:10,960 --> 05:55:13,113
But then all you have to do is just say, hey, here's the peel

5653
05:55:13,114 --> 05:55:16,923
number and it's like the date. I think it's free. And back in that

5654
05:55:16,924 --> 05:55:19,749
way. But ideally,

5655
05:55:19,750 --> 05:55:22,122
we could get it to where, uh,

5656
05:55:22,133 --> 05:55:26,573
I see. As well. Bye All of us.

5657
05:55:27,342 --> 05:55:30,018
Unless they have an electrical coordinator in here,

5658
05:55:30,019 --> 05:55:32,668
not that they, who and where the purchase from,

5659
05:55:32,669 --> 05:55:35,929
but. How about we see this,

5660
05:55:35,930 --> 05:55:43,725
this is a map to you at the time. Bye Here,

5661
05:55:43,726 --> 05:55:46,316
seven months later. Basically,

5662
05:55:46,317 --> 05:55:49,915
cats are on the inside of the beach. We'll be-

5663
05:55:58,056 --> 05:56:02,717
But, um, if we want to solve our fit

5664
05:56:02,718 --> 05:56:04,859
up triggers the QC inspection,

5665
05:56:04,860 --> 05:56:06,031
um, just to-

5666
05:56:14,076 --> 05:56:17,523
Well, I guess you can, can do that.

5667
05:56:17,524 --> 05:56:20,229
Like, if you haven't taken an inspection, you can still mark it off in

5668
05:56:20,230 --> 05:56:23,057
peace track and within the building. Only one,

5669
05:56:23,058 --> 05:56:25,249
every ten, so.

5670
05:56:26,065 --> 05:56:28,704
Yeah, anything that's in the route here.

5671
05:56:28,705 --> 05:56:33,075
You're welcome. They're expected you are another percent of the Right.

5672
05:56:33,342 --> 05:56:35,762
So, if you see what,

5673
05:56:35,763 --> 05:56:38,076
you know, ten percent of it, then- Thanks.

5674
05:56:41,597 --> 05:56:42,657
Right. I mean, he can go through and check out a temper done, right?

5675
05:56:42,658 --> 05:56:46,056
And then he still has his own special.

5676
05:56:46,057 --> 05:56:48,406
. . . Yeah, and, or, you know,

5677
05:56:48,824 --> 05:56:52,693
he can do it this way. He's saying the whole batch has been assembled

5678
05:56:53,121 --> 05:56:55,582
and better be Just, you see, basically,

5679
05:56:55,583 --> 05:56:58,301
you know, like a whole world-type thing, you can fill up.

5680
05:56:58,596 --> 05:57:02,071
There's you can still, just fill out from all the attention.

5681
05:57:02,072 --> 05:57:04,322
You can have those records, you know,

5682
05:57:04,369 --> 05:57:09,523
that the whole plot. We're talking about the next thing is- There

5683
05:57:09,524 --> 05:57:12,346
we There's way of a package of the rest of the parties.

5684
05:57:12,347 --> 05:57:26,080
eyes. Search.

5685
05:57:26,081 --> 05:57:28,362
Thank much. And, uh,

5686
05:57:28,373 --> 05:57:30,577
that's it. Umm, takin' the stock professionally.

5687
05:57:30,807 --> 05:57:32,931
Kinda when they cut out the cut, that's the takin' stock,

5688
05:57:32,932 --> 05:57:34,531
get more down. So let's proceed. I your Have great evening. Okay, see you

5689
05:57:34,532 --> 05:57:36,791
Thank you. I you. The categories will get down. That's the code. See the

5690
05:57:36,792 --> 05:57:40,198
code. And then the assembly portion will be straight.

5691
05:57:40,199 --> 05:57:43,100
Alright, we'll see you in the end.

5692
05:57:44,185 --> 05:57:48,361
That's what we did. Cause there's a few things here where you guys are

5693
05:57:48,362 --> 05:57:50,707
going to make packaging.

5694
05:57:50,708 --> 05:57:53,505
You make it easier to move them.

5695
05:57:54,264 --> 05:57:58,528
They have for, for the long set up that we had.

5696
05:57:58,529 --> 05:58:03,288
Bye. And so they're

5697
05:58:03,289 --> 05:58:06,936
ideally you load up, um, a card, and that card would have all the-

5698
05:58:06,937 --> 05:58:11,638
sater traps, whatever need it, and then that would be more labeled with that

5699
05:58:11,639 --> 05:58:14,027
word hack, or something, but with that one, that one,

5700
05:58:14,028 --> 05:58:16,730
so. No. No. Umm.

5701
05:58:16,741 --> 05:58:19,015
So, you know, that need those parts here, too, is to,

5702
05:58:19,542 --> 05:58:22,012
to the imagine those, go to the field, and be able to ask.

5703
05:58:22,560 --> 05:58:25,242
Whatever. Yeah, so maybe we'll let them in.

5704
05:58:25,243 --> 05:58:28,226
. .

5705
05:58:28,227 --> 05:58:31,111
.

5706
05:58:31,112 --> 05:58:35,802
I think

5707
05:58:35,803 --> 05:58:39,001
we'll need to know that we'll grow down. At least we'll know what's about

5708
05:58:39,002 --> 05:58:42,035
it. . I don't know how many parts you need,

5709
05:58:42,036 --> 05:58:44,807
but let's say, I mean, this looks like a huge quantity to be.

5710
05:58:44,808 --> 05:58:47,191
No. No.

5711
05:58:47,192 --> 05:58:51,879
I mean, is it like three carts on

5712
05:58:51,880 --> 05:58:54,457
a job? Or is it like fifty carts on a job?

5713
05:58:54,458 --> 05:58:58,263
We'd probably- have, uhm,

5714
05:58:58,274 --> 05:59:02,220
hope not that we have one e to 30 in rotation,

5715
05:59:02,314 --> 05:59:06,953
and then total. the wall. is. I over time break everything like one week

5716
05:59:06,954 --> 05:59:11,517
work packages, so if we're the week ahead of the We weeks in

5717
05:59:11,518 --> 05:59:13,667
the field and a week's coming back,

5718
05:59:13,857 --> 05:59:16,001
yeah, and I always would give you 10, you know,

5719
05:59:16,002 --> 05:59:18,880
in the field at the time. Umm, that's here locally.

5720
05:59:18,881 --> 05:59:21,061
Okay. What happens if they go to the higher?

5721
05:59:22,255 --> 05:59:25,982
That's the highest problem. Okay. Now we are just asking what we've done,

5722
05:59:25,983 --> 05:59:28,375
so between the Iowa. Bye bye. And Texas,

5723
05:59:28,547 --> 05:59:30,626
they have their own fabshops there,

5724
05:59:30,627 --> 05:59:33,547
and so that's their own rotation. So don't worry about that.

5725
05:59:34,326 --> 05:59:37,568
We started doing, pre-fap or down seer until they got there,

5726
05:59:37,939 --> 05:59:40,222
their pre-fap shot up in there. And then now,

5727
05:59:40,223 --> 05:59:43,411
cause that's what we, what we did on that one is,

5728
05:59:43,412 --> 05:59:46,937
the pre-fap parts, and we did the first hit-minute while they were getting started,

5729
05:59:47,050 --> 05:59:49,659
and then that was their first set of parts that you used to ship

5730
05:59:49,660 --> 05:59:53,327
out of the job scene. But, I think the farthest one that we're gonna

5731
05:59:53,328 --> 05:59:56,087
have to figure out is New Mexico.

5732
05:59:56,582 --> 05:59:59,080
It's probably gonna be the next one where we're gonna have to come up

5733
05:59:59,081 --> 06:00:01,543
with some s- sort of plan to be able to ship.

5734
06:00:01,586 --> 06:00:04,054
And then ideally not,

5735
06:00:04,055 --> 06:00:06,187
uh, we just need a ballot on the power.

5736
06:00:06,188 --> 06:00:08,357
Now we're going to get it back and,

5737
06:00:08,358 --> 06:00:11,375
in fact, talk about ways of looking at it.

5738
06:00:11,376 --> 06:00:14,040
You know, so you just have enough and rotation depending on what you have

5739
06:00:14,713 --> 06:00:19,215
on your back. Yeah, and you actually look right on the end of it.

5740
06:00:19,721 --> 06:00:22,275
Like, do you, like,

5741
06:00:22,280 --> 06:00:24,970
get something back? It goes. Okay folks. The arts, or like,

5742
06:00:24,971 --> 06:00:28,169
just do single trips, and then maybe,

5743
06:00:28,170 --> 06:00:32,450
really guys, come back, you know, maybe we'd be so- some sort of class,

5744
06:00:32,451 --> 06:00:34,997
you know, when the guys come back for, you know,

5745
06:00:35,459 --> 06:00:37,622
their family stuff, and they're a couple of meetings,

5746
06:00:37,623 --> 06:00:39,696
so we just, you know, have them go right.

5747
06:00:39,697 --> 06:00:42,879
And we all, umm,

5748
06:00:42,890 --> 06:00:45,950
but in exactly those, it's, as assembly's in your eye,

5749
06:00:45,951 --> 06:00:48,952
we have to ship, and then we have to- . I'm ship on soon

5750
06:00:48,953 --> 06:00:51,784
thinking better, right. We should feel that they will use a little more.

5751
06:00:52,517 --> 06:00:55,776
I don't know. You just leave it with it.

5752
06:00:55,777 --> 06:00:59,721
Ehm. It just can get interesting when two shops have any bunch of cars.

5753
06:00:59,722 --> 06:01:02,974
It's like a, your chasing those things,

5754
06:01:02,975 --> 06:01:05,709
right. Okay. I just care pretty quickly,

5755
06:01:05,710 --> 06:01:07,969
too. Uhm.

5756
06:01:07,980 --> 06:01:10,070
I'm really kind of long to track this.

5757
06:01:10,071 --> 06:01:14,719
Uhm. Chocolate. you like that about a pack of different things.

5758
06:01:14,720 --> 06:01:17,108
There's not really a mechanism in which you can do one of them.

5759
06:01:17,843 --> 06:01:20,477
And then you can put them along the truck. Well, let's do basically,

5760
06:01:20,478 --> 06:01:23,772
uhm,

5761
06:01:23,783 --> 06:01:26,246
but that you have to receive them in the field,

5762
06:01:26,247 --> 06:01:28,181
right, or else they can constantly show them. I'll never. I'll never. I guess

5763
06:01:28,182 --> 06:01:31,971
you could do. I appreciate you doing that.

5764
06:01:31,972 --> 06:01:36,806
I'm ahead and do the next step

5765
06:01:37,151 --> 06:01:39,868
in the show, return or something like that,

5766
06:01:39,869 --> 06:01:42,630
where those incentives, the cost of the show is not returning,

5767
06:01:42,631 --> 06:01:45,392
and then once they do get- ... return and check back in,

5768
06:01:45,999 --> 06:01:49,662
then you can go to an ownership of the fact that it's just saving

5769
06:01:49,663 --> 06:01:52,056
a lot. Okay, yeah. Yeah.

5770
06:01:52,057 --> 06:01:54,633
And all of those, you know, those are mine.

5771
06:01:55,045 --> 06:01:57,500
Okay, we're just talking. Okay.

5772
06:01:57,501 --> 06:01:59,570
Yeah. Just cart of this.

5773
06:02:00,091 --> 06:02:03,407
I have to start with these things. Yeah. Well,

5774
06:02:03,408 --> 06:02:05,554
I was wondering if we were just,

5775
06:02:05,675 --> 06:02:08,141
but then suddenly again, I told you.

5776
06:02:08,142 --> 06:02:11,703
Umm, but not really because I'm,

5777
06:02:11,704 --> 06:02:14,754
uh, a track disaster that goes back and forth.

5778
06:02:15,092 --> 06:02:18,405
But I'm wondering what you're- The only thing here in some of this fashion

5779
06:02:18,406 --> 06:02:20,418
is in here is pretty much a long building.

5780
06:02:20,518 --> 06:02:25,938
Right. Okay. And I

5781
06:02:25,939 --> 06:02:30,705
need to try, I need you to work in as fashion as to,

5782
06:02:30,706 --> 06:02:33,951
You Try not to check out,

5783
06:02:33,952 --> 06:02:36,908
like, grinders and, ok, I'm gonna do it again.

5784
06:02:38,416 --> 06:02:43,943
And when they check, they're not using us. . And

5785
06:02:43,944 --> 06:02:47,718
then when they check back here and leave, you know how we were doing

5786
06:02:47,719 --> 06:02:50,968
that. We didn't up on the snuck. We didn't follow up on that.

5787
06:02:51,623 --> 06:02:53,751
Closest that I have to, you know what I'm saying. So,

5788
06:02:54,587 --> 06:02:59,149
that might be a way to get into the way. And

5789
06:02:59,150 --> 06:03:01,468
that's something we could probably, uh,

5790
06:03:01,478 --> 06:03:04,411
we can leverage them, and I said one or the other.

5791
06:03:04,412 --> 06:03:06,629
Or is it the thing that you're adhered,

5792
06:03:06,630 --> 06:03:08,140
or something like that? Yeah. Okay.

5793
06:03:12,456 --> 06:03:14,791
Or just manage it, like, you know, like,

5794
06:03:14,792 --> 06:03:17,080
I have a true asset, right? It might be interesting.

5795
06:03:18,794 --> 06:03:22,522
I would build it to be more of a, I'm a innovative person or

5796
06:03:22,523 --> 06:03:25,630
a very good candidate. But part of that was,

5797
06:03:25,631 --> 06:03:28,536
uh, like the filters we kinda brash and,

5798
06:03:28,537 --> 06:03:32,161
. . In the disappear me gone, we never really forgot back about it.

5799
06:03:32,162 --> 06:03:34,593
Alright, so we had to do that, because we had to do but they

5800
06:03:34,594 --> 06:03:38,234
did this job site. And we got back on the estate and here's what

5801
06:03:38,235 --> 06:03:40,694
we did that took it. So if we never saw it come back,

5802
06:03:40,850 --> 06:03:43,603
you know, I got that. You grab it so we can get a very

5803
06:03:43,604 --> 06:03:47,774
easy lift. Yeah. So I wonder if all the markets just track those cars.

5804
06:03:48,570 --> 06:03:51,520
And the what? The tool was going down. Yeah. duration 3rd.

5805
06:03:51,521 --> 06:03:56,730
Now, I've got I at the All right! All right. Yeah. I don't

5806
06:03:56,731 --> 06:04:00,691
see really.

5807
06:04:00,692 --> 06:04:03,655
So we're getting back to getting one to water. That's great.

5808
06:04:03,656 --> 06:04:08,171
I wonder if between them and we take

5809
06:04:08,172 --> 06:04:11,898
the light. Bye. But, uhm,

5810
06:04:11,908 --> 06:04:14,639
the little material that you are, that you're just looking at,

5811
06:04:14,786 --> 06:04:17,821
get the whole thing and work. I'm sorry. You could get it to be

5812
06:04:17,822 --> 06:04:20,209
important. And then, kind of,

5813
06:04:20,583 --> 06:04:24,278
okay, here's a release. Let's walk all the way through and say.

5814
06:04:24,279 --> 06:04:28,129
Bye bye. So, one, I can just go ahead and do the next thing.

5815
06:04:28,445 --> 06:04:30,601
Forward, or, get on and have this,

5816
06:04:30,602 --> 06:04:32,851
and just kind of walk all the way through. I'm going to pick up.

5817
06:04:32,852 --> 06:04:35,197
And, and I'll say I'm just going to do it,

5818
06:04:35,271 --> 06:04:39,915
then uh, uhm, we're on across

5819
06:04:39,916 --> 06:04:43,166
the issues. Thanks. So,

5820
06:04:43,167 --> 06:04:45,529
I'm not going to be good if we get that out. Is there a

5821
06:04:45,530 --> 06:04:47,971
way to get that electronically relevant to you yet?

5822
06:04:47,972 --> 06:04:51,480
Thank much. And that's what, let me see if I can get,

5823
06:04:51,481 --> 06:04:56,140
uhm,

5824
06:04:56,151 --> 06:04:58,429
about layers. Cheers. I can get,

5825
06:04:58,978 --> 06:05:01,905
like, so, one can just release,

5826
06:05:01,906 --> 06:05:04,766
uhm, all the way project PDF.

5827
06:05:04,767 --> 06:05:07,408
Have a good day. I don't have to, uh, check it with me,

5828
06:05:07,409 --> 06:05:09,859
but it really makes no more sense to me.

5829
06:05:09,860 --> 06:05:12,576
But it's infeasible,

5830
06:05:12,577 --> 06:05:16,062
so I'm not worried. I'm sorry. I don't have to think I did really

5831
06:05:16,063 --> 06:05:20,573
kinda underrated, but I used check to do the nesting

5832
06:05:20,574 --> 06:05:24,415
on the wire. And, It's utilization down to like,

5833
06:05:24,416 --> 06:05:28,197
uhm, I think we got like 15% drop,

5834
06:05:28,198 --> 06:05:31,378
uhm, and then, they're ready. And I really would like,

5835
06:05:31,933 --> 06:05:35,553
like, uhm, percent if that, and if they would point zero for me,

5836
06:05:35,554 --> 06:05:37,776
uhm, that was the way we got it,

5837
06:05:37,883 --> 06:05:41,801
you know. No. Really, we're just about how we're gonna take off.

5838
06:05:42,005 --> 06:05:42,244
Yeah. Yeah.

5839
06:05:46,291 --> 06:05:51,291
And,

5840
06:05:52,710 --> 06:05:56,574
uh, what do you know about this, uhm, week? We'll guys in just export

5841
06:05:56,575 --> 06:05:59,094
out, sure. And export out the,

5842
06:05:59,095 --> 06:06:02,253
uhm. I'm curious how you put it here.

5843
06:06:02,254 --> 06:06:04,875
Thank you. Seriously,

5844
06:06:04,876 --> 06:06:07,760
did I ask them to or did you just copy them?

5845
06:06:07,761 --> 06:06:11,193
Uhh, I would say if that's a bit of an instance and it has

5846
06:06:11,194 --> 06:06:13,784
a, I would say to save all the other sizes.

5847
06:06:14,026 --> 06:06:17,767
Yeah. And then it'll just be catered to what we have and we can

5848
06:06:17,768 --> 06:06:19,786
clear out it as we don't need it. Yeah.

5849
06:06:19,787 --> 06:06:24,894
And if it's not, then we can take that export and

5850
06:06:24,895 --> 06:06:27,336
push it through. Cause yeah.

5851
06:06:27,337 --> 06:06:31,907
Like I guess, considering how many times on the back and forth about the

5852
06:06:31,908 --> 06:06:34,942
youngness. Yeah. They have to eat it decent.

5853
06:06:34,986 --> 06:06:37,374
Yeah. You have seen instance in a circuit port.

5854
06:06:37,875 --> 06:06:40,232
So, if you can say phone and service,

5855
06:06:40,233 --> 06:06:42,434
they all have a button, a selected,

5856
06:06:42,435 --> 06:06:44,811
they'll just read that. Yeah. Yeah,

5857
06:06:44,812 --> 06:06:49,136
let's run this and consider it a matter of fact.

5858
06:06:49,137 --> 06:06:51,331
Can you hear it? Um. Come on.

5859
06:06:51,332 --> 06:06:54,279
I mean, what's going on with it? Because this is,

5860
06:06:54,280 --> 06:06:56,582
and it is incredibly small.

5861
06:06:56,583 --> 06:07:01,493
Whoa. You

5862
06:07:01,494 --> 06:07:04,370
must keep babies at common. Yes.

5863
06:07:05,581 --> 06:07:09,636
Especially that. Okay. I'm on the.

5864
06:07:09,637 --> 06:07:11,946
I can't believe this. All the time.

5865
06:07:12,924 --> 06:07:19,497
Take care of. Yeah.

5866
06:07:19,917 --> 06:07:22,171
Thank you, uhm. You know what,

5867
06:07:22,172 --> 06:07:24,207
isn't a can't hold in here with the regular stuff,

5868
06:07:24,208 --> 06:07:26,969
but that would also keep itself- So, So, we get,

5869
06:07:26,970 --> 06:07:29,443
uhm,

5870
06:07:29,453 --> 06:07:33,751
I'll go, I'll go.

5871
06:07:33,752 --> 06:07:37,205
I'm a copy of the point that it's,

5872
06:07:37,366 --> 06:07:40,340
so, I mean I'm playing with that box that it makes,

5873
06:07:40,341 --> 06:07:42,533
uh, if all the- I just wanna say,

5874
06:07:42,552 --> 06:07:45,128
I don't wanna have to take the um, do through and wipe out everything

5875
06:07:45,129 --> 06:07:48,642
you got in there. Do you wanna get plenty of weakness or slower?

5876
06:07:48,643 --> 06:07:50,710
Well, with that there- Yeah,

5877
06:07:51,180 --> 06:07:53,208
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

5878
06:07:53,209 --> 06:07:56,388
yeah. It hurts. Switch it back out to I.T.E.A.L.S.

5879
06:07:56,389 --> 06:08:00,286
and assist me. Yeah. It's not too hard usually.

5880
06:08:00,287 --> 06:08:03,799
I mean, it'll be a big ask if I'm sure it'll be interesting when

5881
06:08:03,800 --> 06:08:05,911
you know for a lot. Yeah, I'm willing. All in.

5882
06:08:05,912 --> 06:08:09,184
All of our jobs. And disabled boy,

5883
06:08:09,185 --> 06:08:12,306
all right. I'm going to make you know the signs that I don't need

5884
06:08:13,079 --> 06:08:15,274
help that. So. Thank I'm sorry. It's your shoulder bit.

5885
06:08:17,958 --> 06:08:20,882
Yeah. So. I think that goes out and that is our red.

5886
06:08:20,883 --> 06:08:23,742
So. Thank you. That's, you know, a project that you do.

5887
06:08:24,569 --> 06:08:26,717
Yeah. Yeah. But that's all I can do.

5888
06:08:27,075 --> 06:08:29,354
No. And then, and then,

5889
06:08:29,355 --> 06:08:32,339
bye-bye. Welcome. Once it's in line of the trailer and the files bring in

5890
06:08:32,340 --> 06:08:34,344
load, it's the one I didn't click.

5891
06:08:34,345 --> 06:08:39,430
Okay. Bruce,

5892
06:08:39,431 --> 06:08:44,223
you just dropped it in a

5893
06:08:44,224 --> 06:08:46,899
quarter. So, I'm- I was like,

5894
06:08:47,369 --> 06:08:52,071
I was like, how much did you take it and I just

5895
06:08:52,072 --> 06:08:56,038
like, did I really not grab- I had that one of my favorite customers,

5896
06:08:56,412 --> 06:08:58,507
so. You should put a little bit of praise in my eye.

5897
06:08:58,508 --> 06:09:02,080
Listen, I want to be out of the realm of my- I to do

5898
06:09:02,081 --> 06:09:03,604
Sometimes I'm I want I the ability for me to look at that and

5899
06:09:03,605 --> 06:09:06,162
go, I don't mean to. And you get it.

5900
06:09:06,206 --> 06:09:10,231
I do. I need it done. So. I'm just kidding.

5901
06:09:10,232 --> 06:09:14,768
I don't know. That's the camera just sitting there going through

5902
06:09:14,769 --> 06:09:18,271
each drawing. All the way along.

5903
06:09:18,272 --> 06:09:21,019
It'll be a lot faster for the important action,

5904
06:09:21,029 --> 06:09:21,254
please. Yeah. Thank you.

5905
06:09:34,471 --> 06:09:37,799
Ah, you mean you have an older subscriber than those?

5906
06:09:38,590 --> 06:09:41,166
Thank you. Umm, why is it on the other screen?

5907
06:09:41,265 --> 06:09:43,411
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

5908
06:09:43,412 --> 06:09:45,901
Well, pretty sure it's a big deal,

5909
06:09:46,876 --> 06:09:49,063
but I wish you could. I don't know if it's in the action work,

5910
06:09:49,064 --> 06:09:51,108
but it's a blast. Oh! More of it.

5911
06:09:51,109 --> 06:09:53,446
You don't want to be dead.

5912
06:09:53,768 --> 06:09:57,358
I want to be dead.

5913
06:09:57,359 --> 06:09:59,960
And That's it.

5914
06:09:59,961 --> 06:10:02,404
I'm going to ahead and I'll see you Yeah, that's it. All right.

5915
06:10:02,405 --> 06:10:05,160
Thank you.

5916
06:10:05,161 --> 06:10:07,080
All right.

5917
06:10:24,391 --> 06:10:28,877
Hey,

5918
06:10:28,878 --> 06:10:31,402
uhh, uhh, uhh,

5919
06:10:31,403 --> 06:10:36,642
uhh, uhh, uhh, we're making cold water cold, so you can, ehm,

5920
06:10:36,643 --> 06:10:38,982
ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm,

5921
06:10:38,983 --> 06:10:42,730
ehm. See you. Bye. Bye. And if you're — but you guys you did

5922
06:10:42,835 --> 06:10:45,824
you actually regret it? I'm glad I did. You used to do it and

5923
06:10:45,825 --> 06:10:48,424
everything quite easily. You should have checked now,

5924
06:10:48,425 --> 06:10:50,780
or something. I think it's hard to Okay.

5925
06:10:50,781 --> 06:10:53,997
Good. You're on your journey.

5926
06:10:54,109 --> 06:10:57,391
See you. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Good morning.

5927

5986
06:16:18,526 --> 06:16:22,840
going back, so what if you pull in the- the chart over again?

5987
06:16:22,841 --> 06:16:28,662

we'll go back to Oh So,

5991
06:16:53,561 --> 06:16:56,556
we have a full label is needed.

5992
06:16:56,557 --> 06:17:00,906
It needs to be something exact to order, right? If it's on the store,

5993
06:17:00,929 --> 06:17:03,220
I can just free math it.

5994
06:17:03,221 --> 06:17:06,099
That's It's not just a, We'll call and we'll look at it for what

5995
06:17:06,100 --> 06:17:09,655
to have. Okay, so, flip drawing.

5996
06:17:10,883 --> 06:17:15,529
We have hound. Alright. With the count,

5997
06:17:15,530 --> 06:17:21,068
it's only really applying to, I

5998
06:17:21,182 --> 06:17:25,584
think it's the overall assembly that is going to be a piece marked with

5999
06:17:25,585 --> 06:17:31,627
low stride. Alright. Bad.

6000
06:17:31,628 --> 06:17:31,110
Bye.

6001
06:17:36,751 --> 06:17:38,979
You know, I'm not this side,

6002
06:17:38,980 --> 06:17:42,334
but it's right. It's not everyone. It's not everyone.

6003
06:17:42,470 --> 06:17:44,796
And then, I think.

6004
06:17:44,797 --> 06:17:48,619
I'm creating this key.

6005
06:17:48,981 --> 06:17:52,234
We're not assigning grades and they're all as far as,

6006
06:17:52,235 --> 06:17:54,347
um. All This on the stride while it was,

6007
06:17:58,053 --> 06:18:00,828
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do something pretty back in.

6008
06:18:08,911 --> 06:18:13,581
I'm not sure. So if I wanted

6009
06:18:13,582 --> 06:18:16,951
to reach all of us, essentially if I wanted to read a word.

6010
06:18:16,952 --> 06:18:20,594
. . I would like this to where, you see how our label,

6011
06:18:21,294 --> 06:18:23,846
and then our labels can be described.

6012
06:18:24,120 --> 06:18:29,045
And then And I would want another line,

6013
06:18:30,042 --> 06:18:32,127
after that, toward the label,

6014
06:18:32,559 --> 06:18:35,307
to be The label would read,

6015
06:18:35,308 --> 06:18:39,751
like, R1, and then the last three digits of the label.

6016
06:18:39,752 --> 06:18:44,363
I'm cool. Okay. Just so I can produce a part for

6017
06:18:44,458 --> 06:18:45,289
the Roblins. Thanks.

6018
06:18:49,711 --> 06:18:52,519
He's running there. Yeah, so I don't even want it.

6019
06:18:54,020 --> 06:18:56,151
So essentially we have all this list of cover.

6020
06:18:56,152 --> 06:18:59,420
I heard it. So I don't want the leather.

6021
06:19:01,111 --> 06:19:03,742
Another lace, and then a belayable.

6022

6023

06:23:33,166 --> 06:23:36,226
like, actual files, you're doing the same Excel import,

6084
06:23:36,312 --> 06:23:38,551
or how are we doing that? Yeah.

6085
06:23:38,552 --> 06:23:40,566
I don't know, I'm gonna get it. Yeah,

6086
06:23:40,567 --> 06:23:44,789
most of the coding's customers have been supplying case files.

6087
06:23:44,790 --> 06:23:46,825
house. The,

6088
06:23:46,996 --> 06:23:49,192
without, without the case file,

6089
06:23:49,193 --> 06:23:52,450
uhm, it can't, it's the need to change the order,

6090
06:23:52,451 --> 06:23:55,038
man, it can't. and on the that,

6091
06:23:55,076 --> 06:23:57,277
that would be probably the only other way,

6092
06:23:57,667 --> 06:24:01,674
could be manual imports and in Excel,

6093
06:24:01,675 --> 06:24:04,036
into what's we can do. 4 3 So the brush shot,

6094
06:24:04,037 --> 06:24:06,282
you've been getting better, like, at the moment.

6095
06:24:06,619 --> 06:24:08,674
As far as? Yeah. Yeah,

6096
06:24:08,675 --> 06:24:11,398
especially with the one that's coming up for t- that's very,

6097
06:24:11,399 --> 06:24:16,154
very good to be w And then we're going

6098
06:24:16,239 --> 06:24:18,756
to stop that they're going to get them working.

6099
06:24:18,757 --> 06:24:22,174
That's called an important,

6100
06:24:22,175 --> 06:24:24,268
pretty easily in here. So,

6101
06:24:24,408 --> 06:24:26,760
I have all that. that. Go .

6102
06:24:26,791 --> 06:24:31,077
You know, it doesn't need from the cradle stuff in order to prevent getting

6103
06:24:31,078 --> 06:24:33,892
a lot of blood getting just lost.

6104
06:24:34,308 --> 06:24:39,784
So. I'm sorry. Are you trying to get PFS

6105
06:24:39,785 --> 06:24:42,705
emails on your jumps while you kiss us?

6106
06:24:42,706 --> 06:24:46,830
and Because his files aren't going to go the way it's not.

6107
06:24:46,831 --> 06:24:48,863
Yeah, very good job, sir.

6108
06:24:49,327 --> 06:24:52,079
Yeah, and with them. and uhm,

6109
06:24:52,089 --> 06:24:54,604
but then you can do the kids as well as they export out of

6110
06:24:54,605 --> 06:24:58,493
their service and then give us their own sex.

6111
06:24:58,494 --> 06:25:00,598
Thanks. Umm, but,

6112
06:25:01,132 --> 06:25:04,410
yeah, they've been doing kiss calls and then we'll be giving IFCs,

6113
06:25:04,411 --> 06:25:07,001
umm, yeah, yeah, and then with birthdays that they're right.

6114
06:25:07,002 --> 06:25:11,682
Umm, but I know these seven IFCs that I can upload to me the

6115
06:25:11,811 --> 06:25:15,522
trouble from is the day they- like,

6116
06:25:15,638 --> 06:25:18,875
we can make updates on it so we can enjoy the IFC every single

6117
06:25:18,876 --> 06:25:21,461
week with revisions. Alright,

6118
06:25:21,462 --> 06:25:23,988
we're using, uhm, opinions that- uh, all in store.

6119
06:25:23,989 --> 06:25:27,784
Uh, nothing for codeings of the documents and stuff,

6120
06:25:27,785 --> 06:25:30,002
but, uh,

6121
06:25:30,012 --> 06:25:34,054
for files that you- I'm requesting that I'm actually giving IFCs,

6122
06:25:34,055 --> 06:25:38,402
uhm, kiss files. They have not supported AFXD file.

6123
06:25:38,610 --> 06:25:40,743
Well. And then yeah. So.

6124
06:25:41,354 --> 06:25:44,098
But. We don't know how to show it.

6125
06:25:44,099 --> 06:25:46,247
It works like part of what we know. So,

6126
06:25:46,248 --> 06:25:48,572
there's just gonna be a- Just, yeah, a few next to you,

6127
06:25:48,573 --> 06:25:50,974
probably, as you can be, tat it up,

6128
06:25:51,788 --> 06:25:56,361
tah, tah, I'm going to detail Detailer

6129
06:25:56,362 --> 06:25:58,584
with the end of the mountain. SDS,

6130
06:25:58,585 --> 06:26:00,585
you're going to tell me which part of it is.

6131
06:26:01,094 --> 06:26:03,276
Thank you again, yeah, a lot of this. All let's do this.

6132
06:26:03,277 --> 06:26:05,462
Probably, probably.

6133
06:26:05,463 --> 06:26:08,821
Yeah, sometimes it takes a little longer than me.

6134
06:26:08,822 --> 06:26:11,316
Yeah, I'm forward to the eye of this off.

6135
06:26:11,317 --> 06:26:13,603
. I'll set up in here. I just see that at all the volume

6136
06:26:13,604 --> 06:26:16,536
that we added. Uhm, a complex paper.

6137
06:26:16,537 --> 06:26:18,540
Uhm, s-uhm, m-m, m-m, m-m.

6138
06:26:18,541 --> 06:26:21,003
Thank Uhm,

6139
06:26:21,014 --> 06:26:23,051
well, it's adding to this component. Uh,

6140
06:26:23,061 --> 06:26:27,385
we've seen- Thank you.

6141
06:26:27,386 --> 06:26:29,741
I've seen what we broke out yesterday.

6142
06:26:30,222 --> 06:26:34,306
So now, now that we have the ability to track their prep intermediate your

6143
06:26:34,307 --> 06:26:36,822
quote, prime and finish. So, for the complex.

6144
06:26:37,249 --> 06:26:39,312
And, uhm,

6145
06:26:39,323 --> 06:26:42,580
and all the leaves can be marked up in EP and go.

6146
06:26:42,847 --> 06:26:46,926
And then we'll- also create an inspection and work more for them for their

6147
06:26:46,927 --> 06:26:50,562
service prep in our inspection area.

6148
06:26:50,563 --> 06:26:52,982
Period. So that they can do,

6149
06:26:52,983 --> 06:26:55,701
uh, and, uh,

6150
06:26:55,712 --> 06:26:57,989
more so that they can get away from side dogs.

6151
06:26:57,990 --> 06:27:01,801
But. I'm glad to see you. Most of all of his reports can be

6152
06:27:01,802 --> 06:27:05,151
read on in here. And then you can go.

6153
06:27:05,552 --> 06:27:07,591
So I'm assuming in the future. I'm going show you.

6154
06:27:07,592 --> 06:27:10,475
Once we actually get to the website,

6155
06:27:10,476 --> 06:27:13,391
that's the link. If you do, umm,

6156
06:27:13,402 --> 06:27:17,070
all of that stuff can be transferred in. Thank So,

6157
06:27:17,071 --> 06:27:19,277
hm,

6158
06:27:19,278 --> 06:27:21,511
hm,

6159
06:27:21,512 --> 06:27:26,301
hm, hm, hm. So, between three, You We added three different coating types,

6160
06:27:26,510 --> 06:27:29,297
so we got the high solids, the steel spark,

6161
06:27:29,560 --> 06:27:31,711
and uhm,

6162
06:27:31,712 --> 06:27:33,555
Acropoxy. See

6163
06:27:39,751 --> 06:27:44,501
So we added

6164
06:27:44,502 --> 06:27:47,231
all these in configurably container sizes.

6165
06:27:47,232 --> 06:27:50,063
We'll see For what their purchasable units are,

6166
06:27:50,402 --> 06:27:54,755
and the cost per gallon, which might be updated if that test changed,

6167
06:27:55,019 --> 06:27:59,641
and then their co- average. So estimates when we plug one in

6168
06:28:00,455 --> 06:28:03,871
should be pretty up point with exactly what they're looking for.

6169
06:28:03,872 --> 06:28:08,624
. . Umm, and for what our estimates will show over

6170
06:28:08,625 --> 06:28:10,926
how many gallons they need over the price and the summary.

6171
06:28:10,927 --> 06:28:14,137
We'll see in the square footage you suggest.

6172
06:28:14,677 --> 06:28:18,886
Does that, does that description carry through a travel interval?

6173
06:28:19,003 --> 06:28:21,044
Bye No, it doesn't,

6174
06:28:21,045 --> 06:28:23,307
uh, it doesn't best for a travel interval.

6175
06:28:24,098 --> 06:28:27,558
So, I did. We did.

6176
06:28:27,677 --> 06:28:30,443
You ended up adding into production,

6177
06:28:30,444 --> 06:28:33,897
uhm, additional finishes in here.

6178
06:28:34,390 --> 06:28:38,461
So, we do have complex. That's it guys. B2 and sp3 and sp6,

6179
06:28:38,462 --> 06:28:42,076
as well as simple as a 1-2-6.

6180
06:28:42,077 --> 06:28:45,793
So, we'll at least have a prep. right there. We'll have follow up with

6181
06:28:45,794 --> 06:28:47,877
the finish and that will show up on the challenge.

6182
06:28:47,878 --> 06:28:51,961
Umm, but you can kinda adjust the finishes however we want,

6183
06:28:51,962 --> 06:28:57,144
so. So, If we wanted to add the hate spec and the surface prospect

6184
06:28:57,145 --> 06:29:00,151
in there, we could. It's just gonna make this again come along.

6185
06:29:00,152 --> 06:29:04,677
No, I'm actually not. We have already planted the peach

6186
06:29:04,678 --> 06:29:07,370
oil on board with bricks. Spectral,

6187
06:29:07,371 --> 06:29:12,684
y'know, out of the sh want to make sure to be

6188
06:29:13,315 --> 06:29:17,790
the I also want to make sure we're not.

6189
06:29:18,169 --> 06:29:20,584
Possibly. And flitting down.

6190
06:29:21,005 --> 06:29:23,226
Yeah. No,

6191
06:29:23,227 --> 06:29:25,586
we should be good there. Thank you. Umm, none of that.

6192
06:29:26,047 --> 06:29:27,971
All those, I don't know if we were just looking at it or just

6193
06:29:27,972 --> 06:29:30,001
on the estimate side. So,

6194
06:29:30,376 --> 06:29:34,818
those are the options you can pick. When you're starting a new job,

6195
06:29:35,252 --> 06:29:39,919
if you're in here, you can go into your paid system and go

6196
06:29:39,920 --> 06:29:44,787
in here. You can move over multiple codes and do custom systems and

6197
06:29:44,788 --> 06:29:48,396
then clean systems as well. If you're doing them as people.

6198
06:29:48,397 --> 06:29:50,616
If you move them into sp6,

6199
06:29:50,617 --> 06:29:55,514
then you can account for the layer for multiple systems for senior systems

6200
06:29:55,515 --> 06:29:58,073
and your estimates. So. Hello.

6201
06:30:04,476 --> 06:30:06,893
We got that pretty bad with the new spray.

6202
06:30:07,582 --> 06:30:12,511
And, and adjusted the labor in there so that it's matching with mose-

6203
06:30:12,512 --> 06:30:16,376
and concur leading out for one man or her new spirit foot and one

6204
06:30:16,377 --> 06:30:19,031
man or her new spirit foot for prep and prep.

6205
06:30:19,032 --> 06:30:21,665
So. So. That's,

6206
06:30:21,666 --> 06:30:25,381
that's it.

6207
06:30:26,604 --> 06:30:28,961
Today we've come in and messing with. All right.

6208
06:30:28,962 --> 06:30:32,328
Umm, adjusting labor.

6209
06:30:32,329 --> 06:30:35,865
So we adjusted a couple of the well-done position rates in the air because

6210
06:30:35,866 --> 06:30:38,568
they were- so the amount of the box rates.

6211
06:30:39,089 --> 06:30:43,409
So we increased some because the rates were really small in there.

6212
06:30:43,771 --> 06:30:47,389
So we dialed up. you the, uh,

6213
06:30:47,400 --> 06:30:50,234
in these seats a per minute,

6214
06:30:50,235 --> 06:30:52,956
per feet per hour. In here for. Thank you for your attention.

6215
06:30:52,957 --> 06:30:55,101
I'm going a range of 5,

6216
06:30:55,102 --> 06:30:58,019
16, 3, 8s on those basic moments.

6217
06:30:58,492 --> 06:31:00,991
And then I'll also learn in the minutes. Thank you very much.

6218
06:31:00,992 --> 06:31:03,061
Umm, increase our fit time a little bit.

6219
06:31:03,512 --> 06:31:06,259
So our well time, I'm down a little. Bit time,

6220
06:31:06,260 --> 06:31:08,422
increase a little. Which is usually,

6221
06:31:08,423 --> 06:31:11,450
you know, is So our adjustments on our projects is,

6222
06:31:12,159 --> 06:31:15,944
it needs a little bit more involvement as you show it a little over

6223
06:31:15,945 --> 06:31:20,859
stuff. So. And we're working to continue

6224
06:31:20,860 --> 06:31:24,335
to find that, uhm, looking at historical projects.

6225
06:31:24,336 --> 06:31:28,259
Okay, bye. Having gotten to a point where he would have been able to

6226
06:31:28,260 --> 06:31:32,317
identify specifically where issues are coming in with play.

6227
06:31:32,656 --> 06:31:35,643
So. So, It's been kind of my new adjustments at this point,

6228
06:31:35,644 --> 06:31:40,154
uhm, but finally continuing to look at existing

6229
06:31:40,155 --> 06:31:43,784
projects and just to- and breakouts, and then the estimates,

6230
06:31:44,206 --> 06:31:47,895
and then you can compare the actual versions of the estimated versus supplied.

6231
06:31:47,896 --> 06:31:50,336
Alright, we'll see you in the next time we can get our numbers to

6232
06:31:50,337 --> 06:31:53,744
all jive, up across the board. Sign here.

6233
06:31:54,231 --> 06:31:56,627
So, so the outcome I clean the actual back in.

6234
06:31:56,669 --> 06:32:01,262
Okay. Okay. Right. The. One

6235
06:32:01,263 --> 06:32:05,823
of the issues that's always been with what's your actual- We'll

6236
06:32:05,824 --> 06:32:10,378
see you next It's possible, right? What's your actual linear for what was done,

6237
06:32:10,379 --> 06:32:13,515
or what- What you've got to estimate.

6238
06:32:13,516 --> 06:32:16,243
Thank you. And so, it's hard to,

6239
06:32:16,244 --> 06:32:20,515
you know, if you wait the hours done to when you estimate it,

6240
06:32:20,516 --> 06:32:23,846
then it was actually- You don't know me.

6241
06:32:23,847 --> 06:32:28,101
And so, we'll get a camera. But wait.

6242
06:32:28,102 --> 06:32:33,477
Unless- Once we dig into everything and spend a lot of time processing

6243
06:32:33,680 --> 06:32:36,673
the PMST or whatever the import is on it,

6244
06:32:36,983 --> 06:32:39,274
we're not gonna come up with that. It's an actual screw.

6245
06:32:40,543 --> 06:32:42,740
What was the detail of what was done, right?

6246
06:32:44,243 --> 06:32:46,429
You talk about it like I did with my head. It's not a hundred

6247
06:32:46,430 --> 06:32:48,863
hours on the basement, but what they want,

6248
06:32:48,864 --> 06:32:52,130
that black shirt, should be $600.

6249
06:32:52,131 --> 06:32:56,694
I'm saying 78 feet. A well that was estimated based

6250
06:32:56,695 --> 06:32:59,523
on all the clips and everything, but in reality,

6251
06:32:59,524 --> 06:33:02,011
we did 87 feet of the welding.

6252
06:33:02,012 --> 06:33:06,109
Because I was deep down a bit of front floor,

6253
06:33:06,113 --> 06:33:08,124
and I just wanted to paint it off right here. Yeah,

6254
06:33:08,128 --> 06:33:10,504
it's any one of the estimated versus versus versus,

6255
06:33:10,505 --> 06:33:13,030
right? Like. Bye bye. So it's, it's too, I mean,

6256
06:33:13,031 --> 06:33:15,854
it's estimated versus, you know, what was assumed,

6257
06:33:16,001 --> 06:33:18,666
right? And then, you know, let's say it took about 10 months for that

6258
06:33:18,667 --> 06:33:20,670
shirt. It's something like that,

6259
06:33:20,671 --> 06:33:23,650
right? Or whatever. Whatever athletic detail that we didn't mean,

6260
06:33:23,651 --> 06:33:25,767
it was meant to actually do things or something like that, alright?

6261
06:33:25,768 --> 06:33:30,429
So, change. So, that's kind of so special to me.

6262
06:33:30,430 --> 06:33:34,558
Well, I mean, I think go on cuts or at least me because those

6263
06:33:34,559 --> 06:33:37,397
are- pretty close to all of me and actually,

6264
06:33:37,398 --> 06:33:40,668
but, uh, the welts have always been kind of,

6265
06:33:40,669 --> 06:33:45,182
uh, ehm, ehm, you don't want to divide it back into what was

6266
06:33:45,183 --> 06:33:47,841
estimated. It's a good excuse to have that,

6267
06:33:47,897 --> 06:33:50,220
right? Yeah. Um, so,

6268
06:33:50,221 --> 06:33:52,535
one more idea. You ehm,

6269
06:33:52,536 --> 06:33:55,610
I count for some time in here. It's not an exciting silence.

6270
06:33:56,264 --> 06:33:59,728
But when you leave the professional control down back to the estimate,

6271
06:34:00,490 --> 06:34:04,811
it can bring those hours over and apply some material that's in production control,

6272
06:34:04,812 --> 06:34:09,624
right? Now, what it does is it does- it's not on a hour-supercom

6273
06:34:09,625 --> 06:34:12,127
basis, so if it's,

6274
06:34:12,128 --> 06:34:15,995
like, okay, they- You You know,

6275
06:34:15,996 --> 06:34:18,610
my, uh, base plate sizes have deep roots,

6276
06:34:18,803 --> 06:34:21,205
my AMA, yeah. Like we said,

6277
06:34:21,206 --> 06:34:23,480
a bunch of pork chicken, right? Mm-hmm. Well. But they,

6278
06:34:23,481 --> 06:34:26,321
you get my sideovers and they're because they're having it.

6279
06:34:26,684 --> 06:34:31,056
But it's not moving at every age of oil because he doesn't.

6280
06:34:31,057 --> 06:34:33,237
The men are there with the reaching control side.

6281
06:34:33,488 --> 06:34:35,749
It does look nice and clean so that, right. But,

6282
06:34:35,750 --> 06:34:39,036
uhm, that, that helps a lot.

6283
06:34:39,037 --> 06:34:42,512
My shots are the same point as boys. They're on the street because they're

6284
06:34:42,513 --> 06:34:47,071
like, always put over on haters because you're judging me based on-

6285
06:34:47,072 --> 06:34:51,844
the estimated hours and things changed and there's a lot

6286
06:34:51,845 --> 06:34:55,051
more work plus all these changes in their young period.

6287
06:34:55,052 --> 06:34:57,610
Well, what's that?

6288
06:34:57,611 --> 06:34:59,955
What's this production control? It capital is ours.

6289
06:35:00,414 --> 06:35:02,893
So, they can't account for some of that,

6290
06:35:02,894 --> 06:35:05,202
so. Okay. I don't know the exact size of that. So that,

6291
06:35:05,369 --> 06:35:07,374
so once it gets brought up in the production control,

6292
06:35:07,375 --> 06:35:11,071
we're essentially re-establishing our labor budget space all of this.

6293
06:35:15,316 --> 06:35:17,953
That's actually what the base hours are in that project. is that's how it's

6294
06:35:17,954 --> 06:35:22,863
going to go. And what

6295
06:35:22,864 --> 06:35:24,926
that does is, it's estimated that I was in the schedule as well.

6296
06:35:25,460 --> 06:35:29,211
And it compares to this. Thank you. It's estimated to the base hours.

6297
06:35:29,212 --> 06:35:31,822
Let's say we had 500 hours for one,

6298
06:35:32,236 --> 06:35:34,948
for one sequence in the estimated hours.

6299
06:35:34,949 --> 06:35:39,546
those. . . And the base hours was 575.

6300
06:35:39,547 --> 06:35:42,988
It was used for 575 instead of the vibe.

6301
06:35:42,989 --> 06:35:46,027
I you. Because it said, yeah, when you say 500 out,

6302
06:35:46,033 --> 06:35:48,518
I don't know if on this, but he really got thought they're saving a

6303
06:35:48,519 --> 06:35:50,297
lot of money to work. That's what we're using for that. That's what we're

6304
06:35:50,298 --> 06:35:52,774
using because base hours aren't doing.

6305
06:35:52,775 --> 06:35:55,944
So were you thinking that just the adjustments,

6306
06:35:56,135 --> 06:35:58,687
incorrect, that we'll not do it that way,

6307
06:35:58,688 --> 06:36:01,422
but whatever. If you're using the estimated hours,

6308
06:36:01,423 --> 06:36:03,746
then the adjustment column. But right now,

6309
06:36:03,747 --> 06:36:06,721
I don't care what you're saying, adjustment has estimated.

6310
06:36:06,722 --> 06:36:09,753
Okay. That's, that's why I see your desire for it.

6311
06:36:09,754 --> 06:36:11,788
Umm,

6312
06:36:11,799 --> 06:36:15,096
the adjustment is essentially- last week.

6313
06:36:15,097 --> 06:36:19,372
We put the adjustment in base and whatever the base hours are showing to

6314
06:36:19,373 --> 06:36:22,709
get it to match what we have released tools.

6315
06:36:22,710 --> 06:36:25,108
We'll see. So analyze it with the,

6316
06:36:25,109 --> 06:36:28,671
and our base hours show that it's, um,

6317
06:36:28,672 --> 06:36:31,292
39 and we'll put the difference in the- uhh,

6318
06:36:31,303 --> 06:36:34,294
so that our- uhh, this is the source of base hours.

6319
06:36:34,295 --> 06:36:37,651
Base hours. Base is based upon production.

6320
06:36:38,134 --> 06:36:42,784
Okay, so let's- . . . So, your- your constantly changing the

6321
06:36:42,785 --> 06:36:46,276
adjustment again to the how to keep it at the hours you want.

6322
06:36:46,277 --> 06:36:48,413
5 8 9 right, you know. So,

6323
06:36:48,416 --> 06:36:51,510
if you would put the estimate and estimate card,

6324
06:36:51,511 --> 06:36:54,605
you would have to do that. Because it's so light on.

6325
06:36:54,606 --> 06:36:58,844
Bye bye. Let's see, the one line that has base out of a 16,

6326
06:36:58,845 --> 06:37:02,810
14 to the adjustment. So you got a total plan hours of 30.

6327
06:37:02,857 --> 06:37:04,909
Alrighty. See that one right there?

6328
06:37:04,910 --> 06:37:07,769
Yeah. Umm, so that one,

6329
06:37:07,770 --> 06:37:10,124
if you have 30 hours of estimated.

6330
06:37:10,125 --> 06:37:12,821
I'm leaving. With 16 in base,

6331
06:37:12,822 --> 06:37:15,396
you enter through the stuff, 14, you're coming,

6332
06:37:15,652 --> 06:37:17,827
and you're, and you're playing hours,

6333
06:37:17,828 --> 06:37:20,039
you're going to be invited. up. And it's, it's, it's,

6334
06:37:20,040 --> 06:37:22,473
it's coming out of the actual time work and how much they've done so

6335
06:37:22,485 --> 06:37:26,393
far. It's, it's coming from, it's it's coming it's coming from,

6336
06:37:26,406 --> 06:37:29,295
it's coming from, it's . It's, uh, how much for the time is,

6337
06:37:29,314 --> 06:37:32,648
you know, more positive than I have seen the piece since I read production

6338
06:37:32,649 --> 06:37:34,652
control to get, to get them.

6339
06:37:34,653 --> 06:37:36,890
in a second. I appreciate it and complete them. Okay.

6340
06:37:36,911 --> 06:37:39,031
Tell me that. I appreciate it. Well, it's, yeah. Yeah,

6341
06:37:39,032 --> 06:37:41,913
you're not definitely in that, I think, because we want to do it,

6342
06:37:41,914 --> 06:37:43,964
because we have to. Thank you. Yeah, well,

6343
06:37:43,965 --> 06:37:46,479
so that doesn't mean we'll meet you. We're not. We're not,

6344
06:37:46,480 --> 06:37:49,126
yeah. We're not manipulating the data because we want to.

6345
06:37:49,127 --> 06:37:51,151
We're manipulating the data because we have to.

6346
06:37:51,152 --> 06:37:55,411
We're not pulling anything over from the original estimate.

6347
06:37:55,412 --> 06:37:59,191
Well, why not say this to me? You're doing it because you want that.

6348
06:37:59,192 --> 06:38:02,178
. . Yeah,

6349
06:38:02,179 --> 06:38:04,983
so if you put the 30 hours of original estimate,

6350
06:38:04,984 --> 06:38:06,995
can you, can you add as much as that's got me?

6351
06:38:06,996 --> 06:38:09,543
So you can't. You can You,

6352
06:38:09,544 --> 06:38:12,081
you can add the hours of original estimate, yeah. Put it in there,

6353
06:38:12,082 --> 06:38:14,348
right there, and then get rid of your adjustment.

6354
06:38:14,858 --> 06:38:18,103
So- You So the summarize, so the original estimate would be,

6355
06:38:18,104 --> 06:38:20,367
so from the PC forum, right? So we'd say,

6356
06:38:20,368 --> 06:38:22,972
Hey guys, this is what we budgeted, you know.

6357
06:38:22,973 --> 06:38:25,739
Thank you. So it just doesn't even need to be there.

6358
06:38:25,757 --> 06:38:29,084
If we'll just throw in the original estimated out of it or the original,

6359
06:38:29,283 --> 06:38:31,762
into the estimated out of it. It's all good. It doesn't.

6360
06:38:31,795 --> 06:38:36,508
And then it'll take whatever the base out is for and figure out where

6361
06:38:36,509 --> 06:38:39,216
to find where it should be. Now, once you're leaving the watch.

6362
06:38:39,217 --> 06:38:44,239
The for them is, let's say that that was 100%

6363
06:38:44,240 --> 06:38:47,196
that, that particular lot was 100% that.

6364
06:38:47,197 --> 06:38:51,098
At least. And you had this situation where original art 30,

6365
06:38:51,099 --> 06:38:52,144
but the base, it's, it's, it's, you really only has it, you know, it'll

6366
06:38:52,145 --> 06:38:54,940
work. I'm sorry.

6367
06:38:54,941 --> 06:38:55,908
But going to But always okay. It's just like, I've done a Hey, that's

6368
06:38:55,909 --> 06:39:00,658
all it's good, right? Well, it's never playing 30 here because it

6369
06:39:00,659 --> 06:39:05,792
thinks more is coming. So it keeps sh- the 100% released to 100%

6370
06:39:05,793 --> 06:39:08,922
that it would use the base hours of 16.

6371
06:39:08,923 --> 06:39:11,305
If I were to send and that's what it was.

6372
06:39:11,306 --> 06:39:15,066
We want to, we want to be managing to the actuals of what the

6373
06:39:15,067 --> 06:39:17,331
work that we're safe and having,

6374
06:39:18,405 --> 06:39:23,057
and using. in. essentially, the knowledge of the original being at 30 to know

6375
06:39:23,058 --> 06:39:25,365
that you've got 14 hours of contingency. and say, okay,

6376
06:39:25,820 --> 06:39:29,264
I'm on the next one. So, good. So, I show that it's 100% realistic

6377
06:39:29,265 --> 06:39:31,802
we put a lightning dang. Yeah,

6378
06:39:31,803 --> 06:39:35,640
put anything in the light up there in here. Get right up here. I'm

6379
06:39:35,641 --> 06:39:38,545
here. Okay, let's move on.

6380
06:39:38,546 --> 06:39:39,920
Let's move on to the base. Thank so much.

6381
06:39:44,071 --> 06:39:46,223
See,

6382
06:39:46,237 --> 06:39:49,114
it's using the web. It still thinks it works kind of,

6383
06:39:49,115 --> 06:39:51,327
but if you change it, you'll see it released through a hundred.

6384
06:39:51,328 --> 06:39:55,909
Thank The reason is, it calculates the percent release based off of the

6385
06:39:55,910 --> 06:40:00,091
average. So, it changes to that because 54 more times.

6386
06:40:00,092 --> 06:40:05,506
But if you change the percent release to 100,

6387
06:40:05,507 --> 06:40:07,703
it would put your land hours back.

6388
06:40:07,704 --> 06:40:08,739
Thanks. That's

6389
06:40:13,351 --> 06:40:16,518
It seems like it's adjusting it for whatever will be put in your original

6390
06:40:16,519 --> 06:40:20,576
videos, right? I didn't do 100 in the panel of Jess.

6391
06:40:23,070 --> 06:40:27,096
Who's the source of original estimate? We got a guy with a,

6392
06:40:27,000 --> 06:40:29,630
a dartboard in Dilbert.

6393
06:40:30,107 --> 06:40:32,339
Right, that's the figure. Right, right.

6394
06:40:34,031 --> 06:40:36,254
Okay, so yeah. So, I would,

6395
06:40:36,255 --> 06:40:40,841
I mean, I guess it's probably an art

6396
06:40:40,842 --> 06:40:44,391
decision, but to leverage this- correct me,

6397
06:40:44,478 --> 06:40:49,238
I would say you would want to- to take whatever your base hours came

6398
06:40:49,239 --> 06:40:54,111
out to be, you would- you would want to that into your original estimate

6399
06:40:54,112 --> 06:40:58,547
number so that you could manage your percent,

6400
06:40:58,548 --> 06:41:02,215
at least, based on- of your base hours that you're updated,

6401
06:41:02,216 --> 06:41:05,078
we have zero, so yeah. Can we check our percent,

6402
06:41:05,079 --> 06:41:07,771
utilize the comfort? Just, like, look at this. So. So,

6403
06:41:07,772 --> 06:41:10,708
We're showing 16 hours, and now I'm showing that I'm in over,

6404
06:41:10,709 --> 06:41:13,360
but in reality on this line, I don't think I should've done.

6405
06:41:13,932 --> 06:41:16,888
Well, that's what I'm saying. So, the base hours, the original estimate I should

6406
06:41:16,889 --> 06:41:21,608
match, and then March should just know that it is actually released.

6407
06:41:22,062 --> 06:41:24,864
So, indeed, that's when we have a, I think the rest of the production

6408
06:41:24,865 --> 06:41:29,214
needs, and he brings us out. He's gonna have a separate column of bows,

6409
06:41:29,215 --> 06:41:31,896
actually. That's gonna be done with this stuff. That's,

6410
06:41:31,897 --> 06:41:35,471
showing that category. You're saying base hours need to line up.

6411
06:41:35,486 --> 06:41:38,049
Yes. I think so. Do we need to adjust all of it across the

6412
06:41:38,050 --> 06:41:41,216
board of men? I would see you. But. We'll in the base hours changes,

6413
06:41:41,217 --> 06:41:45,028
don't it? Base hours will change based off,

6414
06:41:45,029 --> 06:41:47,976
uh, based off of, uhm.

6415
06:41:47,977 --> 06:41:51,681
Important more piece of piece. Base hours will- So if they bring in more

6416
06:41:51,682 --> 06:41:54,390
pieces, then it's going to change that piece. But then the estimate is,

6417
06:41:54,880 --> 06:41:58,463
they're- I mean. But if we leave- if we- if we bring in more

6418
06:41:58,464 --> 06:42:01,430
pieces, but we sequence a lot into a separate sequence,

6419
06:42:01,979 --> 06:42:06,578
well, it's just that same sequence. Thanks. So

6420
06:42:06,579 --> 06:42:09,484
we bring in more pieces, right? We do another thing for this board.

6421
06:42:09,485 --> 06:42:12,091
Now for a step.

6422
06:42:12,092 --> 06:42:16,809
Okay.

6423
06:42:16,810 --> 06:42:18,835
So if we change it across the board, yeah. Yeah. So design. Base out.

6424
06:42:19,728 --> 06:42:23,911
Bye I'm not sure they'll estimate that your percent release here,

6425
06:42:23,912 --> 06:42:26,376
percent. Please are all going to flow through well.

6426
06:42:26,649 --> 06:42:28,992
So as long as, as long as. The, the,

6427
06:42:28,993 --> 06:42:33,092
the PDs that are releasing this stuff are giving you guys the hours before

6428
06:42:33,093 --> 06:42:35,385
that sequence in a lot. Then,

6429
06:42:35,597 --> 06:42:38,001
and you guys are not. Some of that, then, that this works.

6430
06:42:38,002 --> 06:42:40,241
But in a situation where it's like,

6431
06:42:40,927 --> 06:42:43,163
you know, hey, this is one out of three canopies.

6432
06:42:43,164 --> 06:42:46,601
Here's where I go overall. Oh, but. But then we'll just have to,

6433
06:42:46,602 --> 06:42:50,637
uh, we'll just have to make sure that if we pull the accountable and

6434
06:42:50,638 --> 06:42:54,612
then, and then march. We'll just need to know what that is.

6435
06:42:54,613 --> 06:42:58,814
Well, one more reestimates. So let's say markets.

6436
06:42:58,880 --> 06:43:01,206
Okay, so. Something from Gilbert.

6437
06:43:01,742 --> 06:43:04,981
He's like, well, yeah, it's not this. He said it's really this.

6438
06:43:05,261 --> 06:43:07,690
He says that. Where does that come from?

6439
06:43:07,884 --> 06:43:10,472
It's what it is. I'm so alone. It's a s-se-se-se.

6440
06:43:10,962 --> 06:43:14,755
Technically, what your base hour of energy is a s-se-se-se-se.

6441
06:43:14,756 --> 06:43:17,639
Could I work with me? Thank you. It is being re-estinated,

6442
06:43:17,861 --> 06:43:22,000
and that's at your base hours. And so, so the idea was that I'm

6443
06:43:22,947 --> 06:43:25,846
quite doing it this way. When we started a job,

6444
06:43:25,945 --> 06:43:29,204
we weren't even touchless. We could have a discussion of,

6445
06:43:29,205 --> 06:43:31,361
uhm, we're planning to pay for it,

6446
06:43:31,362 --> 06:43:34,102
but I didn't get it. We can at least go into that same thing.

6447
06:43:34,629 --> 06:43:36,965
What change, can we get a change of work?

6448
06:43:36,966 --> 06:43:39,219
I can adjust something, or does it do something like that?

6449
06:43:39,220 --> 06:43:41,644
The more dreams, the better. We just need a little treat that says,

6450
06:43:41,645 --> 06:43:43,761
oh, this has to be good stuff. It's good stuff, it's stuff,

6451
06:43:43,909 --> 06:43:46,762
it's good. So, like, every chance would be perfect,

6452
06:43:46,763 --> 06:43:48,755
and then we'll be able to try to go out to the, because we

6453
06:43:48,756 --> 06:43:50,769
can get done in four hours, and that's,

6454
06:43:50,770 --> 06:43:52,911
that's, uhm, the same. So, uh, you know,

6455
06:43:52,912 --> 06:43:56,256
we can get you all soon to think about that.

6456
06:43:56,257 --> 06:43:58,382
And in mind that I was actually married to,

6457
06:43:58,406 --> 06:44:00,493
I think it's a hard night, but it was just the fun and the

6458
06:44:00,496 --> 06:44:02,508
subjective stuff, but you know, you know, right?

6459
06:44:02,970 --> 06:44:05,878
But I can know that, y-y-y-y-y stuff, and that's what we're coming in with,

6460
06:44:05,879 --> 06:44:08,062
based on what we're saying, the whole world's around.

6461
06:44:08,063 --> 06:44:10,364
Uhh, we're just being popular, you know,

6462
06:44:10,365 --> 06:44:13,716
we're going to list that, uhh, we're going to be like. I'm hearing two

6463
06:44:13,717 --> 06:44:16,440
conversations, I don't have to work down,

6464
06:44:16,465 --> 06:44:21,232
keep it track. Bye. I

6465
06:44:21,233 --> 06:44:24,783
think it's really important that we agree on what this is because we're having

6466
06:44:24,784 --> 06:44:27,339
two summer, he and I are having a discussion,

6467
06:44:27,600 --> 06:44:29,886
and you guys are having a discussion. But I think it's,

6468
06:44:29,991 --> 06:44:33,111
what is the real answer about do this because,

6469
06:44:33,112 --> 06:44:35,595
um,

6470
06:44:35,606 --> 06:44:40,255
Alan is right here. See here. That, that 175 and being calculated between

6471
06:44:41,182 --> 06:44:44,280
two numbers and you're trying to avoid that from habit.

6472
06:44:44,281 --> 06:44:47,000
Good. Good. But, you know, what's your,

6473
06:44:47,009 --> 06:44:50,395
what's your gossip? So now, somehow we really need to do that right in

6474
06:44:50,396 --> 06:44:52,720
mind, yes, it's just change the 16 to 30.

6475
06:44:52,811 --> 06:44:52,896
is

6476
06:44:57,055 --> 06:44:59,749
in the plan, based on anything. In our base. Right?

6477
06:45:00,097 --> 06:45:03,389
Well. you It's great if the estimator actually estimated 30,

6478
06:45:03,390 --> 06:45:06,545
but we've seen some jobs where the estimator estimated right,

6479
06:45:06,546 --> 06:45:08,971
right, right, it won't change. But it will change.

6480
06:45:08,972 --> 06:45:12,767
We're giving, right, if we're only given 14 hours,

6481
06:45:12,768 --> 06:45:15,587
that's where we're adding these original estimated hours,

6482
06:45:15,588 --> 06:45:16,915
right? That's what-

6483
06:45:25,051 --> 06:45:29,705
So on one side, if base hours are coming in less than

6484
06:45:29,706 --> 06:45:32,202
original, right? That's great, right?

6485
06:45:32,219 --> 06:45:35,465
But you want more. You don't plan its production accordingly,

6486
06:45:35,963 --> 06:45:38,300
then we're talking bigger dollars, right? But you don't want to,

6487
06:45:38,301 --> 06:45:42,959
to still, umm, uhh, much of its hours

6488
06:45:43,066 --> 06:45:47,550
based off of, you know, having 10 guys busy versus the base hours saying

6489
06:45:47,551 --> 06:45:49,944
you're only going to keep 3 guys busy. Alright, I think we need to

6490
06:45:49,945 --> 06:45:55,451
show them the community you've collected for the huge jobs and show estimated

6491
06:45:55,452 --> 06:45:59,791
base. Show what's really happening. And then everybody kind of looks at what's really

6492
06:45:59,792 --> 06:46:02,509
going on, uh, and then have that discussion.

6493
06:46:02,746 --> 06:46:05,155
And it's, you know, we make it like, the end of it more like

6494
06:46:05,156 --> 06:46:08,616
day. We've been pulling data just to kind of look at it.

6495
06:46:08,800 --> 06:46:11,526
So, and, but I guess the base hours that aren't,

6496
06:46:11,527 --> 06:46:13,943
uh, you're talking, aren't pulling in. . Well,

6497
06:46:14,223 --> 06:46:17,054
it's, it depends on how you do it.

6498
06:46:17,718 --> 06:46:21,216
So, feel ready. Better.

6499
06:46:21,217 --> 06:46:23,959
Originalist made it. Originalist made it.

6500
06:46:23,986 --> 06:46:27,499
That's what we had a blessing, right? Base hours is saying,

6501
06:46:27,526 --> 06:46:29,769
this is what you have to do. Actually,

6502
06:46:29,830 --> 06:46:32,198
are going to be working for what's,

6503
06:46:32,323 --> 06:46:34,652
for what's out here. So,

6504
06:46:34,653 --> 06:46:37,231
in base hours is accurate. little bit.

6505
06:46:37,232 --> 06:46:41,379
I want that utilization to show you that I'm where,

6506
06:46:41,380 --> 06:46:46,102
umm, because if I literally d- n f 16

6507
06:46:46,103 --> 06:46:49,869
hours of work in thi 30,

6508
06:46:49,870 --> 06:46:52,894
then I want it to be 16. That's w I would be judged on

6509
06:46:52,895 --> 06:46:55,301
this decision. 16 not 30.

6510
06:46:55,302 --> 06:46:57,548
Now, it's good information that it's like,

6511
06:46:57,549 --> 06:47:00,980
okay, cool. Yeah, I believe that I might be a 28.

6512
06:47:01,013 --> 06:47:05,110
Yeah. That's awesome.

6513
06:47:05,111 --> 06:47:09,095
That's great work under, but it didn't actually be bad because it was really

6514
06:47:09,096 --> 06:47:11,277
sick. . I think there was a work that took 28 hours, right?

6515
06:47:11,686 --> 06:47:14,217
So, if the base hours are correct,

6516
06:47:14,754 --> 06:47:19,440
then I wanted to show that. Good. You know,

6517
06:47:19,442 --> 06:47:22,340
son of a, Right. So then it's a constant tweak to get the base

6518
06:47:22,342 --> 06:47:25,651
hours as books to web hours that were actually pretty,

6519
06:47:25,652 --> 06:47:29,116
Producing it correctly. Yeah. It might be not that because,

6520
06:47:29,117 --> 06:47:33,691
let's say, on the estimate, there were 40 gallons,

6521
06:47:33,692 --> 06:47:35,929
there, and now I've only got one column.

6522
06:47:36,123 --> 06:47:38,169
I don't want the base centers to be purchased.

6523
06:47:38,426 --> 06:47:41,048
No, no, no, no, no. What I'm saying is, is what I want is

6524
06:47:41,049 --> 06:47:44,332
the base to be with what you're actually going to produce today.

6525
06:47:44,344 --> 06:47:46,908
Yeah, yeah. So if it says 16 hours, we should be producing it at

6526
06:47:46,909 --> 06:47:49,771
16 hours, right? No. That's what we're shooting for.

6527
06:47:49,772 --> 06:47:52,979
Because regardless of the estimate, they gave us 30 hours to ask food,

6528
06:47:53,301 --> 06:47:55,389
but we should only need 16. Yeah,

6529
06:47:55,391 --> 06:47:58,664
and that's what you should manage for, which is what? And I'll be in

6530
06:47:58,665 --> 06:48:02,364
the day, I think, but then the most things may occur that we're getting

6531
06:48:02,365 --> 06:48:05,254
good data back. Right, and the way we've been utilizing this is.

6532
06:48:05,255 --> 06:48:10,617
is. It's wrong, right? Because what it's going to look at now is

6533
06:48:10,618 --> 06:48:12,904
the hours that we're planning, right?

6534
06:48:12,905 --> 06:48:15,933
you do it.

6535
06:48:15,934 --> 06:48:18,245
So the base hour of the plan is hard to get it.

6536
06:48:18,504 --> 06:48:21,931
You gotta give the shot before they don't get the rest.

6537
06:48:21,932 --> 06:48:25,624
Uhh, well, originally it was the adjustment,

6538
06:48:25,733 --> 06:48:27,864
which is to juggle the hours to fit,

6539
06:48:27,951 --> 06:48:29,971
and then that would bring the plan course over.

6540
06:48:29,972 --> 06:48:32,983
Right, so if it was 16 hours, we'd have 30,

6541
06:48:32,984 --> 06:48:36,912
we would add 2 to that 16 to get the 30 in the plan

6542
06:48:36,913 --> 06:48:41,514
hours. But based on- hours, assuming a 100% release of a base hour

6543
06:48:41,515 --> 06:48:46,051
fitment frame. If- if it's all- All of it.

6544
06:48:46,052 --> 06:48:49,170
Yeah, so if he changes base hours right now,

6545
06:48:49,171 --> 06:48:51,638
since it says a 100%, like,

6546
06:48:51,639 --> 06:48:54,096
change, uhh.

6547
06:48:54,097 --> 06:48:57,817
. ? Right, but if, uh, finally I guess they've done it.

6548
06:48:57,818 --> 06:49:00,009
If you change it to 31, see if you change it, but it should

6549
06:49:00,010 --> 06:49:02,131
change it to quiet. Yeah. Yeah.

6550
06:49:02,132 --> 06:49:04,460
Now, here's,

6551
06:49:04,482 --> 06:49:06,678
here's the game there. What,

6552
06:49:06,807 --> 06:49:09,701
if you do nothing but just connect the two.

6553
06:49:09,702 --> 06:49:14,546
You let's say that hours per ton of the estimate was non-hours of COVID,

6554
06:49:14,547 --> 06:49:18,276
right? I got a non-hours of That's where it's going to apply.

6555
06:49:18,277 --> 06:49:23,282
Well, let's say that this release had some

6556
06:49:23,283 --> 06:49:26,280
stuff that was 25...

6557
06:49:26,311 --> 06:49:30,204
I have hours of time in reality because it's higher,

6558
06:49:30,302 --> 06:49:32,325
let's say it's rails.

6559
06:49:32,326 --> 06:49:35,634
They're gonna be higher hours of the time, right? And some of the stuff

6560
06:49:35,635 --> 06:49:39,811
in the release was four hours a ton because they're just spiller beeps,

6561
06:49:40,073 --> 06:49:42,123
and they're just getting hollows. So.

6562
06:49:42,124 --> 06:49:47,025
Sooo That. Face hours may be whacked

6563
06:49:47,158 --> 06:49:50,371
out because I'm applying done when I should be applying to.

6564
06:49:50,372 --> 06:49:55,015
So there isn't

6565
06:49:55,016 --> 06:49:59,895
a way to do it while this way is going to- Because

6566
06:49:59,896 --> 06:50:02,153
the estimates gonna have to use,

6567
06:50:02,154 --> 06:50:06,451
predict what's called production case, which I'll just call this a production case.

6568
06:50:06,452 --> 06:50:10,895
And so now, pieces in the estimate.

6569
06:50:10,896 --> 06:50:14,496
Let's do it.

6570
06:50:14,497 --> 06:50:19,249
Are going to have to be designated as part of rails or prima beans,

6571
06:50:19,564 --> 06:50:22,525
and the pieces in production control are going to be designated.

6572
06:50:22,526 --> 06:50:27,089
It's rails or prima beans in order to apply these separately instead

6573
06:50:27,090 --> 06:50:29,201
of just the overall average of none.

6574
06:50:29,733 --> 06:50:32,215
So, wait a second. Thanks. Ain't nobody's building that way.

6575
06:50:33,053 --> 06:50:37,240
A lot of companies go this route because of this logic here.

6576
06:50:37,241 --> 06:50:42,145
What? Bye Most of them end up coming back here because

6577
06:50:42,146 --> 06:50:45,974
this is, that's a constant fight.

6578
06:50:45,975 --> 06:50:51,001
I'm back. But

6579
06:50:51,002 --> 06:50:53,923
your releases are very somewhat true.

6580
06:50:53,924 --> 06:50:57,069
Like your releases are columns or you mix work like that. Good. Good. Rails

6581
06:50:57,070 --> 06:50:59,831
of the babies, you know, the stairs will be with rails,

6582
06:50:59,968 --> 06:51:03,144
but that's, I mean, you know, all columns will be with- ehm,

6583
06:51:03,564 --> 06:51:07,687
but it's not. But you're still talking about an overall one,

6584
06:51:07,755 --> 06:51:10,595
okay, you're not talking about several releases.

6585
06:51:10,596 --> 06:51:15,043
See you But it doesn't put it, it is talking about specific releases though.

6586
06:51:15,328 --> 06:51:17,488
For now, it's a little bit later to me get down. Oh, yeah.

6587
06:51:17,489 --> 06:51:21,071
We detail. If we. We just make sure we decill everything out based off

6588
06:51:21,072 --> 06:51:23,151
of a full rail package.

6589
06:51:23,152 --> 06:51:25,470
Yeah, we don't. We don't miss. We don't need to.

6590
06:51:25,471 --> 06:51:28,063
We don't need to. It's changing.

6591
06:51:28,773 --> 06:51:31,159
But if we're, if we're doing rails and it beats,

6592
06:51:31,160 --> 06:51:34,891
then we need to understand that. So technically we need to detail up separately.

6593
06:51:34,892 --> 06:51:38,308
You guys can just assign them to different sequence of laws when they're in

6594
06:51:38,309 --> 06:51:42,616
the board. And then you can bypass having to keep them separated.

6595
06:51:42,617 --> 06:51:47,377
rated. So you guys are just organizing those eight that you actually would produce

6596
06:51:47,378 --> 06:51:49,472
them in the shop, right? So you say, okay,

6597
06:51:49,473 --> 06:51:54,132
like, I want to mark. Bye When you go to actually fan power level

6598
06:51:54,133 --> 06:51:56,164
of the project and say,

6599
06:51:56,165 --> 06:51:58,691
okay, we need to call them all out first,

6600
06:51:58,692 --> 06:52:01,165
right? So you can break that column and see if it's mine,

6601
06:52:01,166 --> 06:52:03,186
and then if he's gonna be it, it's only unique,

6602
06:52:03,803 --> 06:52:06,395
and out for time, or that set of columns,

6603
06:52:06,396 --> 06:52:08,826
right? And then you can, You know, of where things are there,

6604
06:52:08,827 --> 06:52:11,183
but where that's gonna be hard to manage into the overall function of it.

6605
06:52:11,184 --> 06:52:16,045
Okay. Get out of that. Uh, uhh, uhh, uhh, the Shilos

6606
06:52:16,046 --> 06:52:20,705
that last week, they weren't gonna try to find that panel to

6607
06:52:20,706 --> 06:52:23,131
the spruity, uh, or to the button.

6608
06:52:23,132 --> 06:52:26,175
I do think what they didn't do, what they didn't do,

6609
06:52:26,250 --> 06:52:29,308
didn't do was start happening. It's structural versus miscellaneous.

6610
06:52:30,474 --> 06:52:33,223
At the end of the day. Yeah, because if it was which would be

6611
06:52:33,224 --> 06:52:35,623
at least go to the integrity. I mean, it's not pretty open.

6612
06:52:37,968 --> 06:52:38,000
All All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

6613
06:52:38,001 --> 06:52:41,461
right. One package to the mechanics.

6614
06:52:42,889 --> 06:52:44,931
They've already separated. I mean,

6615
06:52:44,932 --> 06:52:48,919
it's not. It's the answer. It's the two for a 0-7-5-8.

6616
06:52:48,920 --> 06:52:51,766
We have a meeting. There was good mentees. There was massive plates.

6617
06:52:51,767 --> 06:52:54,515
There was annual And then there were study comments.

6618
06:52:54,883 --> 06:52:56,932
What do you want? . So, uhm, the meeting of the upstairs.

6619
06:52:56,933 --> 06:52:59,405
What if you grill? If we give it as a sequence,

6620
06:52:59,406 --> 06:53:01,526
uh, and then lock that out, uh,

6621
06:53:01,536 --> 06:53:05,309
as far as, like, okay, cool a bit. Good. The WK's are on live,

6622
06:53:05,649 --> 06:53:07,748
but it's still a heavy-same sequence with the fitness,

6623
06:53:07,749 --> 06:53:10,050
you know, all the correct hours are deep for time.

6624
06:53:10,369 --> 06:53:12,693
But the way that we- . If you don't use production pairs,

6625
06:53:12,694 --> 06:53:17,401
it's the same number I like. But it would do a per-sequence

6626
06:53:17,402 --> 06:53:19,411
analog. Mm-hmm.

6627
06:53:19,412 --> 06:53:22,466
But based off of the way that we estimated on G's,

6628
06:53:22,467 --> 06:53:26,510
we estimated the pace off of it, meaning a stressful job,

6629
06:53:26,557 --> 06:53:29,335
right? So, like, we're not, So,

6630
06:53:29,336 --> 06:53:31,689
that's the reason for it. Yeah,

6631
06:53:31,690 --> 06:53:33,767
we're, I mean, they're going to go check.

6632
06:53:33,898 --> 06:53:36,831
You're may not return overall. Okay. Well,

6633
06:53:36,832 --> 06:53:39,684
the way proms really kind of mistake me at all,

6634
06:53:39,785 --> 06:53:42,544
as in some of the pieces, but you're not going to mean it separately

6635
06:53:42,545 --> 06:53:45,488
separately. We'll see if you're different, how or something like that.

6636
06:53:45,881 --> 06:53:50,462
I would say this would be more, like, blue sittin' to where it's over

6637
06:53:50,463 --> 06:53:53,500
on this. This would be best. I think it's the better.

6638
06:53:53,672 --> 06:53:56,902
You keep structural and this smells like you're saying separate,

6639
06:53:57,351 --> 06:53:59,611
and then we could separate out this smell.

6640
06:53:59,612 --> 06:54:01,915
That smells based on, like, rails,

6641
06:54:02,542 --> 06:54:05,251
stairs, and strangers. Okay, we're about to see,

6642
06:54:05,252 --> 06:54:07,651
you know, this one by nine, I'm gonna tell you because,

6643
06:54:07,652 --> 06:54:10,018
It may not be less of a material,

6644
06:54:10,561 --> 06:54:14,337
but it, or for that disparity like I was talking about,

6645
06:54:14,517 --> 06:54:18,298
but it couldn't be that. And the estimate just didn't have the right stuff

6646
06:54:18,299 --> 06:54:21,510
in it, right? Because maybe it wasn't leaving it out properly,

6647
06:54:21,516 --> 06:54:26,173
or something like that, so. So. Most apps that get into the overall apps

6648
06:54:26,174 --> 06:54:30,702
are intended in most cases for structural and general treatment centers.

6649
06:54:31,229 --> 06:54:33,781
Yeah, we do. I don't how to get started,

6650
06:54:33,782 --> 06:54:36,553
you know. It's, uh, it can be, it can be used in base hours

6651
06:54:36,554 --> 06:54:39,560
since they have adjusted actually. That's what we need to be putting in this

6652
06:54:39,561 --> 06:54:43,055
straight. More than putting them under adjusted health adjustment,

6653
06:54:43,433 --> 06:54:46,158
right? Yeah, please put them underneath.

6654
06:54:46,462 --> 06:54:51,039
So, I didn't have- I learned this column activated so originally it was gas

6655
06:54:51,040 --> 06:54:55,533
power adjustment, and then it should be a digital and base power.

6656
06:54:55,534 --> 06:54:59,649
Thanks. Yeah, what would the existing use for the long run then?

6657
06:54:59,650 --> 06:55:02,726
It would just use original and base. So,

6658
06:55:02,727 --> 06:55:06,223
we use base hours. dollars. And the adjustment in the work that the violin

6659
06:55:06,224 --> 06:55:11,288
is in. So our PC form will add these total

6660
06:55:11,289 --> 06:55:16,266
quantities of- I mean, this is our utilization with- So our utilization is

6661
06:55:16,877 --> 06:55:19,071
coming so close.

6662
06:55:19,404 --> 06:55:23,952
And then- That will give a new flavor

6663
06:55:23,953 --> 06:55:28,051
to the utilization for sure.

6664
06:55:28,052 --> 06:55:32,917
But, it'll also help you on the opposite scenario

6665
06:55:32,973 --> 06:55:36,091
where the hours are packed, the base hours actually come out.

6666
06:55:36,092 --> 06:55:38,783
. . More than their visualness made. Well,

6667
06:55:38,784 --> 06:55:40,841
that's gonna make you look better because it's like,

6668
06:55:40,842 --> 06:55:43,288
I can't, well, we should, uh,

6669
06:55:43,299 --> 06:55:44,131
you know, those issues.

6670
06:55:49,473 --> 06:55:51,035
It just makes it look bad when I notice that's- when you gotta get

6671
06:55:51,036 --> 06:55:53,738
it begun. We'll see guys in the Okay, so the numbers will go somewhere.

6672
06:55:53,739 --> 06:55:57,017
Umm, that'd probably be the most question to you,

6673
06:55:57,018 --> 06:56:01,810
Mike. It's very very So this is definitely

6674
06:56:01,811 --> 06:56:04,955
for LG, or in general. So,

6675
06:56:06,577 --> 06:56:09,424
I would say the- up. Uh, it's just the,

6676
06:56:09,425 --> 06:56:14,136
uh, it's the common fight of estimate versus production,

6677
06:56:14,202 --> 06:56:16,296
right? The estimate or job is funded.

6678
06:56:16,297 --> 06:56:21,526
So it's, uh, it's making sure that we're on the same page

6679
06:56:21,527 --> 06:56:24,331
to me on. Bye!

6680
06:56:24,332 --> 06:56:26,860
When you look back, it's kicked off so that we know,

6681
06:56:27,901 --> 06:56:30,617
do we need to really be interested in this and come up with a

6682
06:56:30,618 --> 06:56:32,669
way to make this into a, uuh,

6683
06:56:32,680 --> 06:56:35,815
as often as job as we can, or do we miss something,

6684
06:56:35,816 --> 06:56:39,561
at least establish what our vegetables It's your man,

6685
06:56:39,640 --> 06:56:42,519
it's his angle. His angle, his angle,

6686
06:56:42,930 --> 06:56:45,924
to make sure the Gilbert guys are getting the Gilbert estimates,

6687
06:56:45,925 --> 06:56:47,965
or anything that numbers really well.

6688
06:56:47,966 --> 06:56:50,425
All over the world. But your goal that far fixes it,

6689
06:56:50,709 --> 06:56:53,489
it marks no pressure really good. I think the,

6690
06:56:53,490 --> 06:56:56,283
the, the main goal here to make a lot is.

6691
06:56:56,284 --> 06:56:58,431
Cheers. Yeah, it's okay, well, I get that.

6692
06:56:58,706 --> 06:57:03,790
The main goal is to, if everyone's using the estimate

6693
06:57:04,054 --> 06:57:08,170
in- right, so all the numbers are based off of the unit rates and

6694
06:57:08,523 --> 06:57:10,730
the math that's divided into this,

6695
06:57:10,731 --> 06:57:12,127
right? So, it- You

6696
06:57:20,491 --> 06:57:23,900
Is it, uh, or is it a unit rating of something that we need

6697
06:57:23,901 --> 06:57:27,453
to fix, right? And I think that's where large we need to come in.

6698
06:57:27,454 --> 06:57:31,968
It's- and It's a

6699
06:57:31,969 --> 06:57:34,261
take off thing. I that's a simple thing to say, okay? It's clearly just

6700
06:57:34,262 --> 06:57:36,516
four columns and, you know, you only add two.

6701
06:57:36,517 --> 06:57:40,298
Right? But if we're trending constantly that I saw,

6702
06:57:40,309 --> 06:57:44,491
it is producing at half the rate that we're actually estimating to.

6703
06:57:44,492 --> 06:57:47,258
That's a global thing that makes you do a dress with,

6704
06:57:47,865 --> 06:57:50,382
you know, women, and it's, and you know, it's actually,

6705
06:57:50,446 --> 06:57:52,536
you know, it's a very sophisticated job.

6706
06:57:52,537 --> 06:57:55,508
And you go, you know what the original husband is,

6707
06:57:55,850 --> 06:57:59,173
before you put it in the shot, somebody looks at it and says,

6708
06:57:59,525 --> 06:58:02,141
no, this husband. It's been, over a year, it's 12 hours,

6709
06:58:02,142 --> 06:58:04,980
it's supposed to be 60, and they do the next five-hour balance.

6710
06:58:04,981 --> 06:58:08,075
It's supposed to be 16, and we're just drilling on it.

6711
06:58:08,076 --> 06:58:12,740
Thank you, Steve. And that's what the base column should be used for,

6712
06:58:12,741 --> 06:58:15,416
correct? No,

6713
06:58:15,417 --> 06:58:18,681
t***. You basically,

6714
06:58:18,682 --> 06:58:21,634
uhh,

6715
06:58:21,635 --> 06:58:22,385
it basically does. If nobody has to go get it and do it, they

6716
06:58:22,386 --> 06:58:24,516
calculate, oh man. Please don't- Love it.

6717
06:58:24,517 --> 06:58:28,941
It's time to get me a set up injury or one of them you

6718
06:58:28,942 --> 06:58:32,551
gotta ignore. It does, but it takes the adage from the estimate.

6719
06:58:32,552 --> 06:58:34,703
The next, uh, yeah, that's, uh, countable.

6720
06:58:34,704 --> 06:58:36,856
I wish I could have you go to a place where I can't.

6721
06:58:37,163 --> 06:58:40,264
The tournament, yeah, that's all you gotta do. But it matters to worry about,

6722
06:58:40,265 --> 06:58:43,058
too. So you have to be willing to enter and make me the best.

6723
06:58:43,059 --> 06:58:45,408
Uh, that's, can you try and get it all ready? All right.

6724
06:58:45,474 --> 06:58:48,244
All right. If you enter something, it really has to be.

6725
06:58:48,343 --> 06:58:52,854
Right? So I was saying, to give it another perspective of what we're talking

6726
06:58:52,855 --> 06:58:55,409
about is, this is going to kill us.

6727
06:58:55,690 --> 06:58:57,765
Let's just say it to. You're doing% work,

6728
06:58:57,766 --> 06:59:01,783
right? And within that estimate, you're doing frame versus structural.

6729
06:59:01,866 --> 06:59:03,978
And this base values here,

6730
06:59:03,986 --> 06:59:07,591
it's good. Good. Look at it and generalize it as if it's the same

6731
06:59:07,592 --> 06:59:10,331
main hours per time as the structure level. But you know it's a more

6732
06:59:10,332 --> 06:59:12,571
complex frame system that's going to need more.

6733
06:59:12,572 --> 06:59:15,985
So mark from the essence and say, I think we need to put a

6734
06:59:15,986 --> 06:59:19,768
fabric on top of that. Let's just add another 20 band on which is

6735
06:59:19,769 --> 06:59:22,633
a little bit, right? And I think that's it.

6736
06:59:23,277 --> 06:59:27,572
I think that's where you would add that back in the adjustment because the

6737
06:59:27,573 --> 06:59:31,782
original estimate, Even though he comes around with barks of action saying that even

6738
06:59:31,783 --> 06:59:35,640
though the bass hits really important in as the low range.

6739
06:59:36,159 --> 06:59:38,709
He still- back out. That's what we can do,

6740
06:59:38,710 --> 06:59:44,551
please. I think that's the end of this event.

6741
06:59:44,552 --> 06:59:46,971
The program, uhm, from the early last minute of the base hours,

6742
06:59:46,972 --> 06:59:50,463
and then if we think there's a necessity to put in the adjustment,

6743
06:59:50,464 --> 06:59:52,585
that's where the arm can put in the edge.

6744
06:59:52,586 --> 06:59:55,409
Just, just like, you know, rates in a, a main hour look,

6745
06:59:55,410 --> 06:59:57,762
right? It's, it's, it's saying that, you know,

6746
06:59:58,382 --> 07:00:00,571
you're at an 80% efficiency, but,

6747
07:00:00,572 --> 07:00:03,599
you have an, you know, okay, I know the pipe's looking air.

6748
07:00:03,600 --> 07:00:06,984
I'm going to need this this next year to bring the guys back down.

6749
07:00:07,518 --> 07:00:10,305
And I think that's, kind of what we're talking about, the adjustment is to

6750
07:00:10,306 --> 07:00:14,232
adjust our mean hours per time based on the complexity of the system that

6751
07:00:14,240 --> 07:00:16,591
it's going to take place and it's gonna,

6752
07:00:16,592 --> 07:00:20,595
I think we've used that adjustment for kind of similar to what you're talking

6753
07:00:20,596 --> 07:00:24,631
about or it's, we had some,

6754
07:00:24,632 --> 07:00:26,809
not having a report or something, but that on there.

6755
07:00:26,810 --> 07:00:30,350
Or that's a change order and there's more happening.

6756
07:00:30,588 --> 07:00:32,611
Usually the adjustment is the excuse.

6757
07:00:32,612 --> 07:00:35,829
And it's, if there's any adjustment,

6758
07:00:35,881 --> 07:00:38,071
there's always a question of what I am assuming.

6759
07:00:38,072 --> 07:00:40,080
What is my mind if there's a change order? Good you.

6760
07:00:40,081 --> 07:00:44,030
Good your turn. Good for the original estimate is going to be updated as

6761
07:00:44,031 --> 07:00:48,636
well. Because you've estimated the change order and your everything.

6762
07:00:48,637 --> 07:00:51,624
Based on correctly as increased, umm.

6763
07:00:51,635 --> 07:00:54,118
Some people want to keep in that area and let's make it fewer,

6764
07:00:54,119 --> 07:00:56,611
but that's why they put it in the south area. Other than that.

6765
07:00:56,612 --> 07:00:59,868
I get it, I call it change order one,

6766
07:00:59,869 --> 07:01:02,746
change order two, but they're still nice together.

6767
07:01:03,549 --> 07:01:08,561
But I think, The factors that we were messing with in

6768
07:01:08,562 --> 07:01:13,388
the local system, were trying to make the numbers and- Mostly math,

6769
07:01:13,389 --> 07:01:15,747
what production was doing remains.

6770
07:01:15,987 --> 07:01:19,436
The problem I've seen is, across three or four jobs,

6771
07:01:19,837 --> 07:01:21,907
it wasn't- . uhh,

6772
07:01:21,917 --> 07:01:23,946
what's the right word? Linear.

6773
07:01:24,640 --> 07:01:27,579
Right? So, you'd think that it would be this factor.

6774
07:01:27,837 --> 07:01:30,192
Well, that matters. And this stuff is not that job.

6775
07:01:30,593 --> 07:01:32,912
So, there's more going on here that meets the eye.

6776
07:01:32,913 --> 07:01:36,572
We probably need a bigger sample set. Got to really figure out.

6777
07:01:36,573 --> 07:01:41,520
No. But a 40-hour or a 150-hour job is

6778
07:01:41,521 --> 07:01:43,747
very different than a 4,000 job.

6779
07:01:43,750 --> 07:01:46,770
There's some things that- I think your, uh,

6780
07:01:46,780 --> 07:01:50,131
getting the global factors closer will only help everybody.

6781
07:01:50,132 --> 07:01:52,540
Yeah. good. Alright, Peter. That one is...

6782
07:01:52,541 --> 07:01:57,145
starting next. That's great. Obviously, at this point, you've got to really take a

6783
07:01:57,146 --> 07:02:00,056
look at what the actual is in order to adjust.

6784
07:02:00,131 --> 07:02:04,942
Yes. Yes. The rest was in there. We're trying to compare to what we

6785
07:02:04,943 --> 07:02:08,223
said the logic was, but I don't know whether that's based on anything.

6786
07:02:08,224 --> 07:02:11,059
See you then. Uhh,

6787
07:02:11,081 --> 07:02:13,736
that is more gut-driven,

6788
07:02:13,737 --> 07:02:16,711
which might be,

6789
07:02:16,712 --> 07:02:20,088
a lot, but, uhm,

6790
07:02:20,099 --> 07:02:22,821
I could not go on a whole day of check time,

6791
07:02:22,822 --> 07:02:32,671
and that's where the- . really

6792
07:02:32,672 --> 07:02:35,910
like you're saying, Sam will send it to the larger Trump.

6793
07:02:36,373 --> 07:02:38,690
There's that aspect or just going on a few timestamps,

6794
07:02:38,691 --> 07:02:40,716
right, actually. Thanks in the next video.

6795
07:02:40,717 --> 07:02:45,782
Just messingly saying, but then we have to be cognizant about the timestony

6796
07:02:45,783 --> 07:02:49,560
sample that we're doing based off of the rules that we're- to create on

6797
07:02:49,561 --> 07:02:53,692
how that, you know. So the way I- the way I perceive it before

6798
07:02:53,693 --> 07:02:58,600
is that we know that- for- for example,

6799
07:02:58,601 --> 07:03:02,324
it's- we should get the same cut time for everything from,

6800
07:03:02,325 --> 07:03:05,168
uh, you know, a W-A that's- you know,

6801
07:03:05,169 --> 07:03:07,312
13 pounds into 14 pounds.

6802
07:03:07,313 --> 07:03:09,525
So, to do a screw time sample,

6803
07:03:09,526 --> 07:03:13,012
we make sure we, uh, take a cut list and buy an- all those,

6804
07:03:13,013 --> 07:03:15,374
like, sizes that match the rule that we have,

6805
07:03:15,753 --> 07:03:19,220
and then apply that time study to that specific chunk,

6806
07:03:19,322 --> 07:03:23,916
and then you validating back. So what that version has many compared to the

6807
07:03:23,917 --> 07:03:26,110
next step up of, you know,

6808
07:03:26,208 --> 07:03:28,716
everything from a 40 pounder and up.

6809
07:03:28,717 --> 07:03:31,111
Now apply it and check that section of it.

6810
07:03:31,578 --> 07:03:35,839
But I don't, it's hard because I don't think you can get true data

6811
07:03:35,840 --> 07:03:39,308
that you want to manipulate. Like, a rule set based off of just even

6812
07:03:39,309 --> 07:03:43,769
large symbols because it's your averaging across angles.

6813
07:03:43,785 --> 07:03:46,096
Where are those at? You don't know what's wrong. It's just some things we

6814
07:03:46,097 --> 07:03:50,809
were told yet the day before. It's something that's basically fudging the hours

6815
07:03:50,810 --> 07:03:54,294
to stay well together. I got everyone to keep in the shot,

6816
07:03:54,295 --> 07:03:56,975
but I'm one of them off. We finished this job,

6817
07:03:57,143 --> 07:03:59,253
the estimated hours from the 100th.

6818
07:03:59,254 --> 07:04:02,857
We only used 60. And now we keep this guy out here working for

6819
07:04:02,858 --> 07:04:05,155
the other 40 hours, and we post the hands that go out.

6820
07:04:05,156 --> 07:04:08,242
So we already know the isn't reading what you're saying,

6821
07:04:08,518 --> 07:04:12,940
all the- the experience is bullshit because we didn't really get back on it.

6822
07:04:12,941 --> 07:04:16,984
And that's where- that's where I think evaluating our rules based on the- through

6823
07:04:16,985 --> 07:04:20,004
times to agree with you. And then- and then you got out of factors

6824
07:04:20,005 --> 07:04:23,083
and everyone agrees saying, okay, like, we did it,

6825
07:04:23,084 --> 07:04:26,483
the guy was- he was- you you know,

6826
07:04:26,484 --> 07:04:29,746
and then we'd back it up and say, well, the 80% back here is

6827
07:04:29,747 --> 07:04:32,657
100% of the- of the- of the impact of the ball.

6828
07:04:32,658 --> 07:04:37,343
yeah yeah when you extrapolate data across white flanges Thank you

6829
07:04:37,344 --> 07:04:39,640
for watching this. Mm hmm.

6830
07:04:39,641 --> 07:04:44,317
Well. you It goes in both directions or just on

6831
07:04:45,659 --> 07:04:48,294
what more you need, right? So let's say I need to send it back

6832
07:04:48,295 --> 07:04:50,855
to your friends. and W85 whatever.

6833
07:04:51,880 --> 07:04:55,300
Because it goes all the way out through to W44.

6834
07:04:55,301 --> 07:04:57,676
Yeah, it was processional. We'll be able to get a piece.

6835
07:04:58,496 --> 07:05:01,280
If I'm looking at the cut. So if I'm looking at the cut,

6836
07:05:01,450 --> 07:05:03,642
it's only the process and when you're the other you're going to be similar

6837
07:05:03,643 --> 07:05:07,478
size and then you're going very short. Well, let's say my numbers work kind

6838
07:05:07,479 --> 07:05:12,225
of typically saying, for this range, now when I get to that

6839
07:05:12,226 --> 07:05:14,585
range. . Yeah. When numbers jerk it down,

6840
07:05:14,586 --> 07:05:18,711
that's the end of the side, and at w24,

6841
07:05:18,712 --> 07:05:20,796
I put a new factor as a go. Okay.

6842
07:05:20,797 --> 07:05:24,616
That direction, too. You can tell at which point you want to get it.

6843
07:05:24,792 --> 07:05:27,055
So, when, when I get it, I,

6844
07:05:27,056 --> 07:05:30,426
I took one, uhhh, one piece.

6845
07:05:31,103 --> 07:05:35,303
Here's what we cut inside and how long until I put it all in

6846
07:05:35,304 --> 07:05:37,761
our passenger thing. You I thought that.

6847
07:05:38,164 --> 07:05:42,803
Yeah, and what I found was that it was,

6848
07:05:42,804 --> 07:05:44,851
it was generally. You know.

6849
07:05:44,852 --> 07:05:48,111
You know, it came within our range, and then I had to get a

6850
07:05:48,112 --> 07:05:51,148
new range going, like you said later. And then it was like,

6851
07:05:51,242 --> 07:05:52,831
eep. Thank you very much.

6852
07:05:57,133 --> 07:06:01,499
But I I knew,

6853
07:06:01,627 --> 07:06:04,866
I knew what that I'd like to. And it's probably one of the people

6854
07:06:04,867 --> 07:06:07,833
on your machinery, too, or, uh, how you're sure that it counts.

6855
07:06:07,834 --> 07:06:09,826
As long as you don't have to teach . You throw it all in,

6856
07:06:09,827 --> 07:06:12,265
but you know that it's range-driven. Yeah.

6857
07:06:12,266 --> 07:06:15,147
I mean, you can paint the range. Wait,

6858
07:06:15,148 --> 07:06:17,657
you're gonna have to create- We're going to create a move. You have in

6859
07:06:17,658 --> 07:06:20,219
your process that say these are our ranges,

6860
07:06:20,683 --> 07:06:23,802
and then on your equipment changes, you have to realize you have to go

6861
07:06:24,148 --> 07:06:26,447
next to that. I, I,

6862
07:06:26,448 --> 07:06:31,114
I've been got, I've got multiple different samples from

6863
07:06:31,115 --> 07:06:32,797
different sizes and all the-

6864
07:06:40,891 --> 07:06:43,746
That's the end of that arm measure. And it was like,

6865
07:06:43,747 --> 07:06:46,330
how close am I later? Okay, that's working really close,

6866
07:06:46,331 --> 07:06:48,871
but I'm good enough. But then the next one didn't get us.

6867
07:06:48,872 --> 07:06:50,699
So I'm going to use that running a bit of a lot to the

6868
07:06:50,700 --> 07:06:52,889
next one. So, yeah, you, you,

6869
07:06:53,425 --> 07:06:56,266
you, you can, you can take part of a range if you want. Now,

6870
07:06:56,267 --> 07:06:59,734
that. That was good. And then you got to understand if it's been a

6871
07:06:59,735 --> 07:07:02,270
check, it's based off with length or,

6872
07:07:02,271 --> 07:07:04,768
uh, weighing back at the entire leader.

6873
07:07:04,769 --> 07:07:07,205
Thank you. I'm sorry, but just fine.

6874
07:07:07,206 --> 07:07:09,718
I'm sorry. You said it. Let me have a rain if you want.

6875
07:07:09,725 --> 07:07:12,117
So, bad question. Wizarding.

6876
07:07:12,166 --> 07:07:14,614
So, good. . . He's got this rain. It was so bad.

6877
07:07:14,615 --> 07:07:17,182
It so bad. mean,

6878
07:07:17,183 --> 07:07:20,081
so whatever. Your channel. Whatever we're cutting on here.

6879
07:07:20,516 --> 07:07:22,722
Hey guys! How long is this? How long is this?

6880
07:07:23,062 --> 07:07:26,473
I think, right. You're signing off. If they don't start shopping,

6881
07:07:26,589 --> 07:07:28,800
I'm gonna, I'm gonna cap this again.

6882
07:07:28,801 --> 07:07:30,975
Good. So, if we were going to be having to do it next time.

6883
07:07:30,976 --> 07:07:35,768
Right, right. But as we were, would it escape that data and apply

6884
07:07:35,769 --> 07:07:38,145
it to, uhm, uhh, ehm,

6885
07:07:38,146 --> 07:07:40,287
the data, ehm,

6886
07:07:40,288 --> 07:07:43,243
if I'm sharing with you guys, and if I didn't sort of stop on

6887
07:07:43,244 --> 07:07:45,252
the, or any of the rules that I'm tracking, Thank having me. And both

6888
07:07:45,253 --> 07:07:48,867
of those would hit your share. So you might do the data on the

6889
07:07:48,868 --> 07:07:51,794
energy. But it's not necessarily because of that.

6890
07:07:51,795 --> 07:07:55,236
We're still going to have to. Someone's going to have to actually interpret and

6891
07:07:55,237 --> 07:07:57,304
manipulate that data into this.

6892
07:07:57,728 --> 07:08:00,931
And, yeah, to me, I was talking about it not a big change of.

6893
07:08:00,932 --> 07:08:03,543
I not going to look at the next job, you know,

6894
07:08:03,544 --> 07:08:06,357
uhm, uhm, uhm, eh. Helping us. No, I'm not going to say that.

6895
07:08:07,533 --> 07:08:09,658
No, but, you don't want it. it. 7 You want it one, you want

6896
07:08:09,659 --> 07:08:13,722
it that for it. Yeah, and you would want to trend the hater consistently,

6897
07:08:13,723 --> 07:08:16,466
uh, in this size, consistently not hitting ours.

6898
07:08:16,467 --> 07:08:18,671
Thanks having us. Let's figure out why,

6899
07:08:18,973 --> 07:08:22,021
and then it's. Yeah, it was way better. I'm gonna buy him 60s.

6900
07:08:22,022 --> 07:08:24,027
Another guy buy him 20s,

6901
07:08:24,028 --> 07:08:26,149
and he's out in the load. Yeah.

6902
07:08:26,150 --> 07:08:32,060
And make sure you know what to make sure, too, because. videos.

6903
07:08:32,061 --> 07:08:35,501
Thanks for we need, if you say, tell me how long it takes to

6904
07:08:35,502 --> 07:08:38,108
get this, well, are we talking just later,

6905
07:08:38,115 --> 07:08:40,610
late running time, or are we talking about,

6906
07:08:40,611 --> 07:08:42,817
okay. I've got a, uhm,

6907
07:08:42,827 --> 07:08:45,323
it's going to be, uh,

6908
07:08:45,333 --> 07:08:47,353
roll it up, ahead of the set,

6909
07:08:47,622 --> 07:08:50,369
now cut it and go. I mean, that's good.

6910
07:08:50,393 --> 07:08:52,692
Well, yeah. Make sure that you have what you're looking for.

6911
07:08:52,928 --> 07:08:55,121
I mean, my brain is, you know, my brain is,

6912
07:08:55,358 --> 07:08:59,233
here's a cut, yes. There. There's 23 pieces on it.

6913
07:08:59,709 --> 07:09:02,315
Yeah. Start, stop. How many cuts can I get?

6914
07:09:02,449 --> 07:09:05,011
That picks all that up. Yeah. Bye.

6915
07:09:05,012 --> 07:09:09,315
It means that that start stop means to correlate to how the move is

6916
07:09:09,316 --> 07:09:12,991
actually written, right? So it's because technically,

6917
07:09:12,992 --> 07:09:17,784
I believe the way that we assumed it originally was that the starting

6918
07:09:17,785 --> 07:09:20,464
is when he gets there and the whole start is pointy,

6919
07:09:20,702 --> 07:09:22,983
right? The cross does check,

6920
07:09:23,340 --> 07:09:25,487
gets it bit up, gets the clamps in,

6921
07:09:25,620 --> 07:09:28,374
and starts, because the right thing gets better on it,

6922
07:09:28,528 --> 07:09:32,125
and it's, indexing it over. That's your start to stop,

6923
07:09:32,263 --> 07:09:34,406
but one cup of meat. Okay?

6924
07:09:34,790 --> 07:09:37,051
And one of the things we have along,

6925
07:09:37,052 --> 07:09:41,083
a long time ago was, we just had it our basic ASL spreadsheet that

6926
07:09:41,084 --> 07:09:43,283
just showed what the process was,

6927
07:09:43,859 --> 07:09:47,273
what the rule was. And then it's had a narrative of kind of where

6928
07:09:47,274 --> 07:09:50,414
we assumed that that number kind of was coming from,

6929
07:09:50,504 --> 07:09:52,531
right? And then so, uh,

6930
07:09:52,542 --> 07:09:52,957
scoot it for no-

6931
07:10:01,051 --> 07:10:03,480
They would go hand is,

6932
07:10:03,533 --> 07:10:06,122
so then there's a lot of overlap that I think is,

6933
07:10:06,282 --> 07:10:08,977
right? It could be a problem, but there's a lot of overlap.

6934
07:10:17,076 --> 07:10:19,669
Me not, we're handling to go to the next,

6935
07:10:20,087 --> 07:10:23,357
to the next station. And does every, I don't know,

6936
07:10:23,358 --> 07:10:27,785
it started last week. Because everybody in the shop,

6937
07:10:27,936 --> 07:10:30,856
I'm sure there's some trying to be there. Does everybody know those rules?

6938
07:10:31,380 --> 07:10:34,556
And that's where I think, right? Thank you for getting asked for years,

6939
07:10:34,557 --> 07:10:38,017
understanding exactly what the numbers really mean.

6940
07:10:38,925 --> 07:10:43,564
Getting them on board without any- or actually going so you can look for

6941
07:10:43,565 --> 07:10:46,920
the whole eyes of it. Okay, yeah. So we're assuming it's this,

6942
07:10:46,921 --> 07:10:49,020
but I'm actually making something that's 80s.

6943
07:10:49,021 --> 07:10:51,972
So the guy's gonna, I'm gonna have to give him some extra turning,

6944
07:10:51,973 --> 07:10:54,697
this is gonna have to walk all the way over there, you know,

6945
07:10:54,698 --> 07:10:57,091
walk all the way back, kind of thing, but understanding.

6946
07:10:57,092 --> 07:10:59,861
Where those, your parameters live,

6947
07:10:59,862 --> 07:11:04,405
or 100% efficiency, and where you should manipulate something going into the next.

6948
07:11:04,406 --> 07:11:07,547
Thanks. So, you should think of it as another big one.

6949
07:11:07,861 --> 07:11:10,221
Wherever job alignment, uh,

6950
07:11:10,232 --> 07:11:12,924
fitting a standard stiffer and a beam work.

6951
07:11:12,925 --> 07:11:17,777
I'm going to be basically versus a frame section or a buff bridge

6952
07:11:17,778 --> 07:11:20,947
basically. Kind of understanding that that's the main side of the What are you

6953
07:11:20,948 --> 07:11:25,932
doing? Well, we're talking about base hours and where do you actually are

6954
07:11:25,933 --> 07:11:28,688
tri-ethmated and really adjust your hours.

6955
07:11:28,689 --> 07:11:34,271
Thank you very much. And maybe you can

6956
07:11:34,272 --> 07:11:36,024
be that with just the overall efficiency, I'm not sure, so that, uh, beginning

6957
07:11:36,025 --> 07:11:40,448
estimate part. Perfect. Do you want to globally do that across an entire 1,000

6958
07:11:40,449 --> 07:11:44,013
ton project, where you just do it on a couple of parts,

6959
07:11:44,295 --> 07:11:46,552
right? I know, I'm sorry. It's a of that domain,

6960
07:11:46,553 --> 07:11:50,472
and those rules, uhh,

6961
07:11:50,473 --> 07:11:52,707

out It, it, it,

7014
07:14:52,114 --> 07:14:54,704
not the pulls it in the original, this one. You, yep. That's what you

7015
07:14:54,705 --> 07:14:58,441
look for. It's a manual, you know. Yeah, because. I'll see you next You

7016
07:14:58,442 --> 07:15:02,989
should have an estimate. You'll know what a sequence is or what a lot

7017
07:15:02,990 --> 07:15:05,911
is. You go a little great now. So you can't interpolate.

7018
07:15:05,912 --> 07:15:07,926
So yeah,

7019
07:15:07,927 --> 07:15:10,826
put that in. Believe that was our,

7020
07:15:10,827 --> 07:15:13,743
uhm, if you did start a stop on the stage.

7021
07:15:13,744 --> 07:15:16,179
Thank you very much. If you you're a linear candidate, uhm,

7022
07:15:16,190 --> 07:15:19,698
that would be that actual hours coming back in from that start stop on

7023
07:15:19,699 --> 07:15:21,991
the stage. So.

7024
07:15:21,992 --> 07:15:24,302
That, that's what I was going to say before,

7025
07:15:24,318 --> 07:15:27,216
if you were going to do time studies with the start stop on the

7026
07:15:27,217 --> 07:15:30,036
stations, that would be the awesome way to do it.

7027
07:15:30,037 --> 07:15:32,680
You just gotta watch on your schedule, because then you might want to build

7028
07:15:32,681 --> 07:15:35,626
a lot, and you gotta slow the start stop on time jacking,

7029
07:15:36,154 --> 07:15:39,723
and then you'll be on the start stop on time. A station is lance,

7030
07:15:39,724 --> 07:15:44,122
and it can double up hours. But kind of going back to your sample

7031
07:15:44,123 --> 07:15:46,788
approach of how you do it is. . . . You don't worry about

7032
07:15:46,789 --> 07:15:49,064
there again. Time study is just one cut,

7033
07:15:49,065 --> 07:15:52,320
right? But if we can group them based off of the rule,

7034
07:15:52,985 --> 07:15:55,100
and you say, okay, here's your cut. You know,

7035
07:15:55,101 --> 07:15:57,584
I'm gonna say two hours with the cutting, right?

7036
07:15:57,585 --> 07:16:00,245
We can now backtrack that into, well,

7037
07:16:00,246 --> 07:16:02,406
okay, he actually took two hours to- like,

7038
07:16:02,540 --> 07:16:05,658
birding cuts, and then you can back down into the bathroom,

7039
07:16:05,803 --> 07:16:09,495
based off of the bathroom. Someone's gonna be- he's gonna hit it the first

7040
07:16:09,496 --> 07:16:12,657
time, someone- he's gonna have to double check,

7041
07:16:12,658 --> 07:16:14,901
because, you know, he burned an inch, forgot about it,

7042
07:16:14,902 --> 07:16:19,273
or whatever he's right, so he- he just created- a big enough sample,

7043
07:16:19,274 --> 07:16:22,878
but that sample has to match a rule, or else it- it blends.

7044
07:16:23,164 --> 07:16:26,934
And so I think we need to really establish what the- rules are,

7045
07:16:26,935 --> 07:16:29,296
and then we can spot check.

7046
07:16:29,297 --> 07:16:33,412
And what we've done on the floor, too, is we get into bigger packages.

7047
07:16:33,413 --> 07:16:35,641
this. We can then take those rules,

7048
07:16:36,003 --> 07:16:39,682
and we want to get competitive. We can go do a couple of sets

7049
07:16:39,853 --> 07:16:41,916
and say, okay, we know that we're going to be running a bunch of

7050
07:16:41,917 --> 07:16:45,280
40 times. Alright, so let's go take one,

7051
07:16:45,281 --> 07:16:47,786
let's just run it through, and then,

7052
07:16:47,787 --> 07:16:50,361
okay, we can actually fine tune that a little.

7053
07:16:50,362 --> 07:16:52,409
you get it and get it and get get it and get it from

7054
07:16:52,410 --> 07:16:55,485
somebody. That's where you can use that efficiency back to the set.

7055
07:16:55,486 --> 07:16:58,471
I think we are going to be getting that efficiency on your own.

7056
07:16:58,472 --> 07:17:01,774
Like the,

7057
07:17:03,306 --> 07:17:06,516
the market disappeared with me, but the banish is right. We, we,

7058
07:17:06,517 --> 07:17:10,413
sure ran that, that higher efficiency than the market,

7059
07:17:10,414 --> 07:17:12,855
or the standard 75% is in there,

7060
07:17:12,856 --> 07:17:16,081
because they're 12 I didn't. Yeah. That's right.

7061
07:17:16,082 --> 07:17:18,240
That it's, so you should be able to fix your up, and that's a

7062
07:17:18,241 --> 07:17:20,611
problem. We've yeah, they're framing,

7063
07:17:20,923 --> 07:17:24,003
but we should have, we should have get more efficient as we do.

7064
07:17:24,218 --> 07:17:27,116
Because it's well or similar. That's what that is,

7065
07:17:27,171 --> 07:17:30,631
right? On user's argument that if you're doing about a thousand,

7066
07:17:30,632 --> 07:17:33,915
Different means that you have to treat each one as you mean.

7067
07:17:33,916 --> 07:17:36,699
Think you're not good enough. Because they're all different,

7068
07:17:36,707 --> 07:17:39,502
right? There's no cheap setup. There's no cheap exactly.

7069
07:17:39,503 --> 07:17:42,128
So in terms of quality efficiency,

7070
07:17:42,219 --> 07:17:46,148
you should actually bring your own us down based on what your base is

7071
07:17:46,154 --> 07:17:49,483
and not that. You haven't touched it in terms of quality.

7072
07:17:49,484 --> 07:17:53,738
But, you gotta kind of get base samples based on rules to know where

7073
07:17:53,739 --> 07:17:56,718
it actually . . That's what the rules look like.

7074
07:17:58,605 --> 07:18:02,114
Oh, there's a sin that's getting right. I think that's where all the rules

7075
07:18:02,115 --> 07:18:06,029
are applying. But there's some, there is somebody's head or somebody's paper.

7076
07:18:06,470 --> 07:18:10,225
That's what we need to get out of the system. So it needs to

7077
07:18:10,226 --> 07:18:12,288
go on. And it's a maintenance,

7078
07:18:12,289 --> 07:18:16,825
right? It's where we have it established. It's

7079
07:18:16,826 --> 07:18:18,931
been, it's been a while, is it? Yes.

7080
07:18:18,932 --> 07:18:21,626
You're just playing in standards.

7081
07:18:21,627 --> 07:18:24,711
Uh, we've been speaking to these doctors.

7082
07:18:24,712 --> 07:18:28,748
Here. You have to play anything.

7083
07:18:29,264 --> 07:18:31,638
So if there were more rules, figure out how to do it.

7084
07:18:33,049 --> 07:18:36,175
Yeah, I mean, I need the justice. business. ... I don't know.

7085
07:18:37,181 --> 07:18:39,317
I don't know.

7086
07:18:39,318 --> 07:18:42,991
I don't know. I don't know.

7087
07:18:42,992 --> 07:18:47,655
I don't know what you're saying.

7088
07:18:47,880 --> 07:18:51,031
Just, just click on Beings. Don't fit here on that.

7089
07:18:51,032 --> 07:18:55,744
Like that. And then sort by Khu. I don't know if this is what

7090
07:18:55,745 --> 07:18:57,855
your phone came with. Up at the top,

7091
07:18:57,856 --> 07:19:01,260
you have another. More. So, this,

7092
07:19:01,317 --> 07:19:03,692
I don't know if this is what you're going to have. There's another load,

7093
07:19:04,047 --> 07:19:07,111
which is gettin' off the truck. Let it down in the off.

7094
07:19:07,112 --> 07:19:10,518
There's a get piece which will get out of the door and take it

7095
07:19:10,519 --> 07:19:14,426
to your machine. I think you should talk about the yesterday that's gonna end

7096
07:19:14,427 --> 07:19:17,196
up with end d- Yeah, so very directly by way,

7097
07:19:17,242 --> 07:19:21,931
right? So where do we really, where do we really vary by way

7098
07:19:21,998 --> 07:19:24,358
on the section, right? Great. But no,

7099
07:19:24,359 --> 07:19:26,702
actually, it depends, right? Like, if it's,

7100
07:19:27,367 --> 07:19:30,914
if it's this way, then, if it's this way to this way,

7101
07:19:31,003 --> 07:19:34,318
then- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, where can you do the language factor for our

7102
07:19:34,319 --> 07:19:36,680
body? Uh,

7103
07:19:36,690 --> 07:19:38,931
honey, honey, we messed with both of them.

7104
07:19:39,195 --> 07:19:42,302
So, okay. I mean, right there, right there, you're going to cross section.

7105
07:19:42,303 --> 07:19:45,728
I know, but we're in the satellite. We were deeper in it than that.

7106
07:19:45,962 --> 07:19:48,834
On air than the satellites? Yeah. Good. Not the maintenance,

7107
07:19:48,835 --> 07:19:51,932
that's the way you're going to be with some language that it never stands.

7108
07:19:51,933 --> 07:19:55,126
. Right,

7109
07:19:55,127 --> 07:19:59,845
so, riding here,

7110
07:20:02,744 --> 07:20:04,771
we looked at something. Thank you.

7111
07:20:04,772 --> 07:20:10,151
The other job is, and we made an adjustment to these minutes

7112
07:20:11,365 --> 07:20:14,621
and then ran the job. you I'll see if it could match the job.

7113
07:20:15,540 --> 07:20:18,023
On job A, it's like, yep, we're great.

7114
07:20:18,419 --> 07:20:20,796
On job B, not so much. Thank much.

7115
07:20:20,797 --> 07:20:22,828
On job C, it was a little closer.

7116
07:20:23,665 --> 07:20:26,589
So, we were messing with it right here.

7117
07:20:27,575 --> 07:20:32,303
So, my question is. Thank you. Is, are there actually rules currently

7118
07:20:32,873 --> 07:20:35,203
for these times? So, that, that,

7119
07:20:35,923 --> 07:20:38,031
one minute thing. So, yeah. And second. So,

7120
07:20:38,032 --> 07:20:41,966
we're happy by five. It's based off of the cross section layer,

7121
07:20:42,224 --> 07:20:44,791
right? But then it's, Alright.

7122
07:20:44,792 --> 07:20:47,677
It's really the unload. See how that's just engineered?

7123
07:20:47,811 --> 07:20:51,972
Well, minutes. Can't tell me that that 3x5 is gonna actually take.

7124
07:20:51,973 --> 07:20:55,888
See ya. 12 minutes, right? But what defines,

7125
07:20:55,889 --> 07:20:58,095
uhh, 3x5,

7126
07:20:58,096 --> 07:21:01,647
what defines 12 minutes? And what I remember is- anything,

7127
07:21:01,648 --> 07:21:06,740
any number from 0 pounds to 30 pounds is 12

7128
07:21:06,741 --> 07:21:08,791
minutes. So, I think it's 14 feet, it takes 12 minutes.

7129
07:21:08,792 --> 07:21:11,680
That's right, and yeah, so that's a, so the 40 foot mark,

7130
07:21:11,681 --> 07:21:15,013
but it's, and that's where it, the easiest way I could ever look at

7131
07:21:15,014 --> 07:21:19,718
it was, it's all, it's all spread. And you kind of start rooting all

7132
07:21:19,719 --> 07:21:23,789
of it, then statements together, and you start defining table,

7133
07:21:24,149 --> 07:21:27,146
why is it- uuh, 14 powder takes,

7134
07:21:27,370 --> 07:21:32,163
or a 40 footer takes, 15 minutes versus a 39

7135
07:21:32,164 --> 07:21:35,259
footer takes. Thanks. Like, whatever, why is that language,

7136
07:21:35,260 --> 07:21:38,641
right? And then you start justifying it from there.

7137
07:21:38,642 --> 07:21:41,204
Cause if you just had a sheer load of three mic- I was at

7138
07:21:41,205 --> 07:21:44,998
her, like, so you had the exact same length on three web eyes,

7139
07:21:45,055 --> 07:21:48,440
funnel, right? And you're gonna funnel cut. And.ming.

7140
07:21:48,441 --> 07:21:50,675
at All right. right. Good. One of your love together.

7141
07:21:50,955 --> 07:21:53,148
You don't want to put it, you know,

7142
07:21:53,149 --> 07:21:55,295
it's a big label. Exactly.

7143
07:21:55,296 --> 07:21:59,546
And that's where. Under. numbers. Seeing me really where these times would really kind

7144
07:21:59,547 --> 07:22:02,726
of compile from a, just a global image that's saying,

7145
07:22:02,727 --> 07:22:04,831
well, that's the main standpoint, everything like that.

7146
07:22:04,832 --> 07:22:07,555
That's where you want to be able to,

7147
07:22:07,556 --> 07:22:11,175
I think, you want to pull a picture, go into where it's going to

7148
07:22:11,176 --> 07:22:13,654
be, you know, hours. All right. Welcome, Mr. Michael. And really don't want from

7149
07:22:13,655 --> 07:22:17,420
a base hour standpoint, knowing that there's no way where it's going to actually

7150
07:22:17,421 --> 07:22:20,419
take us to follow out hours and adjust again from there.

7151
07:22:20,420 --> 07:22:23,660
Thank But you have to have a knowledge with an hour from coming soon

7152
07:22:23,661 --> 07:22:26,376
to be able to think that it's a film. And that's how good we

7153
07:22:26,650 --> 07:22:31,000
go to interview one-on-one and- either and say,

7154
07:22:31,001 --> 07:22:33,456
well, how long to move?

7155
07:22:33,457 --> 07:22:35,580
How long to do both of the clips, and like,

7156
07:22:36,041 --> 07:22:40,706
you'll do it yourself. Thank That's because there's all of these extraneous

7157
07:22:40,707 --> 07:22:43,103
factors on the exceptions as well,

7158
07:22:43,104 --> 07:22:46,653
right? So, okay. Yep. I'm getting sure to measure that.

7159
07:22:46,654 --> 07:22:49,180
That's easy, that's a beautiful, and that's just pretty,

7160
07:22:49,181 --> 07:22:51,397
it more de-ins, right? Don't get that.

7161
07:22:52,124 --> 07:22:55,740
Fun long thing. I'm getting lean, and I'm getting out of the stuff.

7162
07:22:55,987 --> 07:23:00,109
I'm probably going to look at it on the Mac for your job to

7163
07:23:00,110 --> 07:23:03,190
get out of places. And I let me get into all of it up

7164
07:23:03,191 --> 07:23:07,328
or down, cause otherwise, I'll just be down already.

7165
07:23:07,615 --> 07:23:10,622
You know what I'm trying to say? Let's try it. One dot one gear.

7166
07:23:10,789 --> 07:23:13,886
So I've done worse. Let's go see that,

7167
07:23:13,887 --> 07:23:18,470
balta dot fillet and boron- I've changed that one a lot of the time.

7168
07:23:18,969 --> 07:23:22,595
Well, I think I need it, but it's gonna be a little better.

7169
07:23:22,596 --> 07:23:25,170
And I think that's knowing where the- Like,

7170
07:23:25,171 --> 07:23:29,576
roomings go. I think it's gonna help define how to break those signals and

7171
07:23:29,577 --> 07:23:33,305
lots down. So that you can actually come up with a good s- sample

7172
07:23:33,306 --> 07:23:36,399
size that doesn't have a lot of other factors into it,

7173
07:23:36,422 --> 07:23:38,838
looping to get yourself good and pe with that all time.

7174
07:23:39,747 --> 07:23:43,039
If you're kidding, you're, You're an average 25 man on the floor.

7175
07:23:43,040 --> 07:23:47,515
But, uhm, but it's understanding kind of where you're given to you for,

7176
07:23:47,516 --> 07:23:49,916
I'm if you in the middle section,

7177
07:23:50,002 --> 07:23:52,707
I think it's really where you're getting good data.

7178
07:23:53,134 --> 07:23:55,781
So at the end of the day, that's, I think, I mean,

7179
07:23:55,782 --> 07:24:00,350
take the afternoon, y'all. If you have a good set of data in here

7180
07:24:00,351 --> 07:24:04,487
that we really trust, we really know where we can push and where we

7181
07:24:04,488 --> 07:24:07,235
can get it. Everything else is just a take off,

7182
07:24:07,439 --> 07:24:11,401
right? It's just, you just have your funds to take offs good,

7183
07:24:12,063 --> 07:24:14,242
you can really like. I don't understand, but,

7184
07:24:14,243 --> 07:24:17,031
uh, if we don't know where we can, we can't provide the staff,

7185
07:24:17,032 --> 07:24:19,947
it's, I might as well go back to the dark and think,

7186
07:24:19,948 --> 07:24:22,718
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it's gotta be,

7187
07:24:22,719 --> 07:24:27,560
uhm, you gotta get really good actual

7188
07:24:27,561 --> 07:24:32,195
downback. back. I don't think anybody here really kind

7189
07:24:32,196 --> 07:24:34,954
of trusted the actual numbers that we're looking at.

7190
07:24:34,955 --> 07:24:39,463
So, eh, it's really gotta be. You gotta make sure there's

7191
07:24:39,464 --> 07:24:41,980
hours on the jet motor and leaving this unit.

7192
07:24:41,981 --> 07:24:45,178
Alright. And I'll have to make it there. We'll you in You more of

7193
07:24:45,179 --> 07:24:48,673
the jet. I don't know what extent perfect that I'm this lot.

7194
07:24:49,099 --> 07:24:53,385
I didn't trust him. But, yeah. Trust me. We'll see you very good.

7195
07:24:53,476 --> 07:24:55,560
Really good. Last big one.

7196
07:24:56,355 --> 07:24:58,538
Well, I think that's the goal. I think that's the thing we're trying to

7197
07:24:58,539 --> 07:25:00,678
show. But, yeah, we're really good. Wait. I mean, uh. I'm going go ahead

7198
07:25:00,679 --> 07:25:02,910
and in the day, I mean,

7199
07:25:02,911 --> 07:25:05,475
let's just take the maintenance from the problem,

7200
07:25:05,476 --> 07:25:08,716
really, side of the building. We want good data.

7201
07:25:08,717 --> 07:25:12,091
Have a good one. To start getting this accurate,

7202
07:25:12,092 --> 07:25:14,341
where we can trust it and condemn it. Thank you.

7203
07:25:14,586 --> 07:25:16,623
There's still sales side of it.

7204
07:25:16,686 --> 07:25:19,000
No one. . When you can get more money,

7205
07:25:19,147 --> 07:25:23,309
and then it'll be competitive. And then there's the management side of where I

7206
07:25:23,310 --> 07:25:26,910
think more of a. I believe,

7207
07:25:26,911 --> 07:25:31,390
once the door is being able to accurately know how many hours it means

7208
07:25:31,391 --> 07:25:34,007
to do something so we can really say. Hey, customer,

7209
07:25:34,315 --> 07:25:36,917
we're going to have this too on Tuesday. Yeah.

7210
07:25:36,918 --> 07:25:41,582
And really playing out to know I'm overloading on a soft- for the next

7211
07:25:41,583 --> 07:25:44,174
six months, right? I need to get another saw,

7212
07:25:44,175 --> 07:25:47,397
I need to get two shifts going, another operator instead of those two.

7213
07:25:47,860 --> 07:25:50,572
Kinda mean it. I know. I mean, I don't know. I mean,

7214
07:25:50,573 --> 07:25:53,149
there's a lot of,

7215
07:25:53,336 --> 07:25:56,602
ehm, a job scrub. Take out the something else that's in it,

7216
07:25:56,603 --> 07:26:00,296
right? I'm to be in the job job. Supporting the field,

7217
07:26:00,297 --> 07:26:04,615
getting stuck on time is, is a huge factor because those guys,

7218
07:26:04,616 --> 07:26:08,557
I mean. . . We're burning grains, we're burning fire launches,

7219
07:26:08,564 --> 07:26:12,342
like, all sorts of how much we're going to delay some of their stuff

7220
07:26:12,509 --> 07:26:17,320
physically. I mean, Mario gets the

7221
07:26:17,416 --> 07:26:20,983
vaccine only thought a lot of times because we're finishing up the design.

7222
07:26:20,984 --> 07:26:25,712
Bye. It's not always blind and the labor and execution is always

7223
07:26:25,713 --> 07:26:29,023
getting pushed up. So he's trying to really fit things in the narrow window.

7224
07:26:29,024 --> 07:26:33,842
Bye-bye. While juggling 12 other ones and being able to accurately

7225
07:26:33,843 --> 07:26:36,762
say, like, this is really what it's gonna take us.

7226
07:26:37,076 --> 07:26:40,513
I- The plan's out until you're gonna get it on- on the stage is

7227
07:26:40,514 --> 07:26:42,687
gonna be a big schedule to push.

7228
07:26:44,823 --> 07:26:47,464
Yeah, the problem is- I'm just sorry- I mean- that's- even better because that's

7229
07:26:47,465 --> 07:26:52,576
kind of what you can tell to you but- 9.10%

7230
07:26:52,577 --> 07:26:55,075
from the meeting's very perfect.

7231
07:26:57,350 --> 07:27:01,448
And, yeah, I mean, that's, like, the biggest frustration a lot of times when

7232
07:27:01,449 --> 07:27:05,914
I feel this not- No. That's when I lost my knowledge because there's the

7233
07:27:05,915 --> 07:27:08,741
budgets in bigger things when it comes to this,

7234
07:27:08,818 --> 07:27:10,836
but hitting digits.

7235
07:27:10,837 --> 07:27:13,046
But yeah, that's a huge.

7236
07:27:14,246 --> 07:27:18,663
Yeah, and being able to protest that 7,000s with our production schedule will be

7237
07:27:18,664 --> 07:27:21,131
having- and you know, way helpful.

7238
07:27:21,852 --> 07:27:24,253
This is the amount we have for this period of work.

7239
07:27:24,654 --> 07:27:26,856
We can finally start affording the- range.

7240
07:27:26,857 --> 07:27:30,033
And, and make sure that we're able to hit what we got to hit.

7241
07:27:30,770 --> 07:27:34,891
So, uh, so how do we move this?

7242
07:27:34,892 --> 07:27:37,719
How do we take some of this up and,

7243
07:27:37,720 --> 07:27:41,138
and, and, and I'm just thinking out loud here.

7244
07:27:41,631 --> 07:27:45,201
But how do we, come up with ways that we can use,

7245
07:27:47,050 --> 07:27:49,375
what our family body should be,

7246
07:27:49,376 --> 07:27:52,705
to know what we, We can go and check,

7247
07:27:52,941 --> 07:27:56,443
right? Like, how do we, where do we really just find some of the

7248
07:27:56,444 --> 07:27:58,480
stuff to break it into rails and build our beams?

7249
07:27:58,481 --> 07:28:02,972
me. Or cut a list that are up to all channeling to,

7250
07:28:03,695 --> 07:28:06,482
you know, 10 pounds to really start getting some.

7251
07:28:06,483 --> 07:28:09,515
I'll you in next True. True. Yeah.

7252
07:28:11,136 --> 07:28:13,237
Well, let me just say it's from working at what, um.

7253
07:28:13,247 --> 07:28:18,016
Hello. If I look at the data that we were looking at on

7254
07:28:18,017 --> 07:28:20,115
this one, found out, you know, everybody.

7255
07:28:20,116 --> 07:28:22,896
We'll find time for the big answer. But this is it.

7256
07:28:22,897 --> 07:28:26,127
So, ladies and gentlemen, look at those three or five jobs.

7257
07:28:26,128 --> 07:28:29,790
And these are the jobs that I believe were manipulated now.

7258
07:28:29,791 --> 07:28:32,401
So, believe me, they're playing, yeah. That's why they came in.

7259
07:28:32,402 --> 07:28:34,715
Why not? Well, what time were they now?

7260
07:28:35,084 --> 07:28:37,899
I don't know who it is. No problem.

7261
07:28:37,900 --> 07:28:40,603
Yeah. About 30.

7262
07:28:40,604 --> 07:28:44,111
And then, for each split out, you split out two different trussles.

7263
07:28:44,588 --> 07:28:48,762
Yeah, two different trussles. So we did- what was released on our shop package,

7264
07:28:49,060 --> 07:28:52,527
and, you know, the blood in the estimate and the tech glove,

7265
07:28:52,696 --> 07:28:57,354
and then, umm, welcome. and have a head for a screenshot after the opening

7266
07:28:57,355 --> 07:29:01,247
or tweaks in there to try and fine tune in a little bit.

7267
07:29:01,634 --> 07:29:05,091
And, umm, what did- uh, for two, it's not supposed to be anything like

7268
07:29:05,092 --> 07:29:07,629
a two or three of well-paced. Like,

7269
07:29:07,630 --> 07:29:09,895
all right, I'm going to just look at this here. Uh,

7270
07:29:09,906 --> 07:29:13,465
so, here we go. What about the day before you were here on Monday?

7271
07:29:13,466 --> 07:29:18,078
Isn't that the day we've had Mark sitting here and he went over three

7272
07:29:18,079 --> 07:29:21,132
jobs? Bob's. And those ones came out within an hour.

7273
07:29:21,144 --> 07:29:24,480
Yeah, it was. That's the ones that I saw.

7274
07:29:24,684 --> 07:29:26,976
And that's because those have been benefited.

7275
07:29:26,977 --> 07:29:29,165
So what I,

7276
07:29:29,166 --> 07:29:33,374
what I was comparing this to was the budget to what Tackley is.

7277
07:29:33,375 --> 07:29:38,046
Because the, the toad. The actual hours just

7278
07:29:38,047 --> 07:29:40,369
were too perfect. I don't, I don't know that I would trust them.

7279
07:29:40,688 --> 07:29:42,723
But the budget split out as.

7280
07:29:42,724 --> 07:29:47,202
the S opposed to tech love is really what I was comparing it to.

7281
07:29:47,744 --> 07:29:50,145
Yeah, going forward.

7282
07:29:50,368 --> 07:29:53,260
I would be. Like, okay. How long?

7283
07:29:54,253 --> 07:29:56,713
I think what I'm doing is going to keep going backwards.

7284
07:29:56,714 --> 07:29:58,956
I look at everybody's total hours. I wish.

7285
07:29:58,957 --> 07:30:03,356
Compared to the hours that were applied to the job and see if that

7286
07:30:03,993 --> 07:30:06,335
actually lines up. That's why I always run against cable.

7287
07:30:06,336 --> 07:30:09,391
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Just know if it's available.

7288
07:30:10,056 --> 07:30:12,398
It truly is. It truly worked out.

7289
07:30:12,399 --> 07:30:14,971
Well, that's what it makes it the same time.

7290
07:30:14,972 --> 07:30:18,476
So, if you looked at what was, what was the budgeted on that,

7291
07:30:18,908 --> 07:30:21,281
that project ever kind of customer to the chamber,

7292
07:30:21,339 --> 07:30:25,088
we added money for the process of. Uh,

7293
07:30:25,099 --> 07:30:28,386
he, you know, didn't mean last week. And every time he had to include

7294
07:30:28,387 --> 07:30:30,996
it, I saw it. Yeah. He came on the way to sell them.

7295
07:30:30,997 --> 07:30:33,210
And I said, it's good. Yup. Yup.

7296
07:30:33,619 --> 07:30:36,201
That, you know, was prescribed to shoot a good one.

7297
07:30:36,202 --> 07:30:38,635
Yeah, that should have gotten to this exact end of it,

7298
07:30:38,636 --> 07:30:40,757
I think. I that, uh, the, the,

7299
07:30:40,758 --> 07:30:43,375
the, the, the budget, the total, the, the, the session on the back specific

7300
07:30:43,376 --> 07:30:46,291
job, I know that one time. That one got scrapped.

7301
07:30:46,292 --> 07:30:50,660
Okay. Especially the way that we redesign a lot of connections and things a

7302
07:30:50,661 --> 07:30:54,137
lot of more. But I think, so let me change this from estimate to

7303
07:30:54,139 --> 07:30:57,251
actual. Marshall. Great. Yeah. Yeah, they,

7304
07:30:57,582 --> 07:30:59,661
they answer kind of the profile.

7305
07:30:59,822 --> 07:31:02,263
Yeah. So what does Mark estimate off of?

7306
07:31:02,264 --> 07:31:05,540
He estimates. That amazing. He gets the shot points he gets for me.

7307
07:31:06,861 --> 07:31:09,525
Whereas the estimator now, well,

7308
07:31:10,463 --> 07:31:14,482
Mark's checking, right? All right. Like, very long it's actually doing the data.

7309
07:31:14,483 --> 07:31:16,811
I'm trying to do an estimate and then,

7310
07:31:16,972 --> 07:31:20,011
ehm, we're reviewing, and it's going to look like,

7311
07:31:20,012 --> 07:31:22,998
or I didn't estimate enough later.

7312
07:31:23,320 --> 07:31:26,333
And then, once we're on the same page, we then take that back.

7313
07:31:26,334 --> 07:31:29,293
Go ahead. And in the infants,

7314
07:31:29,354 --> 07:31:31,387
within the budgets that we perceive,

7315
07:31:31,388 --> 07:31:35,052
that it's good, we push it through. If it's outside of the budgets,

7316
07:31:35,464 --> 07:31:38,358
then, Then we raise the flag A,

7317
07:31:38,743 --> 07:31:41,448
we think we're gonna have a total return on this one, and that's when

7318
07:31:41,449 --> 07:31:43,563
we can be back to the estimating team to say, A,

7319
07:31:43,564 --> 07:31:46,818
hmmm. Alright, so we asked him if it was something else,

7320
07:31:47,117 --> 07:31:51,996
or are we, are we hiring or dissertion?

7321
07:31:51,997 --> 07:31:56,043
Actually, just preplanning so that if we're going to go over a certain amount

7322
07:31:56,044 --> 07:31:58,928
of the project, at least letting your team know,

7323
07:31:59,374 --> 07:32:03,914
what? Bye. Hold on, participate. Then obviously shoot it for the original

7324
07:32:03,915 --> 07:32:06,678
goal and push the guys to maintain the original hours estimated. Thank I will

7325
07:32:06,679 --> 07:32:10,623
see you in the next . . We can't change our own and make

7326
07:32:10,624 --> 07:32:13,380
up what we're anticipating our own room street.

7327
07:32:13,381 --> 07:32:14,787
Are you in the asking room? Are you in Are you in the asking

7328
07:32:14,788 --> 07:32:18,460
room? asking room? Right. So,

7329
07:32:18,840 --> 07:32:21,159
it depends on the project.

7330
07:32:21,160 --> 07:32:24,031
I don't know. Probably not. No, we have to be looking at the designer.

7331
07:32:24,032 --> 07:32:26,035
You these guys are going to shut, right? So,

7332
07:32:26,036 --> 07:32:29,565
it's a horseback. Yeah. You know. Cause that's where the end of the difference

7333
07:32:29,566 --> 07:32:32,369
is, right? Yeah. Cause, design may- Yeah.

7334
07:32:32,370 --> 07:32:35,001
Made it easier. Yeah.

7335
07:32:35,002 --> 07:32:38,905
Use it all on the end. It's, it's, it's on. It's on.

7336
07:32:38,906 --> 07:32:41,053
I'm gonna Anyway,

7337
07:32:41,117 --> 07:32:43,847
it's different. I like that. Yeah. Point in it.

7338
07:32:43,848 --> 07:32:46,224
And that's, that's me. That's right.

7339
07:32:46,587 --> 07:32:49,614
There it is. You Yeah,

7340
07:32:49,615 --> 07:32:52,885
it is. It's the real big actual time.

7341
07:32:52,939 --> 07:32:55,826
It's, and then fine up front,

7342
07:32:55,976 --> 07:32:59,286
right? It's the- I did it here, so I didn't mind if we had

7343
07:32:59,287 --> 07:33:02,288
an issue to where we didn't, you know. It's not at the end of

7344
07:33:02,289 --> 07:33:05,071
it, we're forecasting. That's the date they did.

7345
07:33:05,072 --> 07:33:07,651
We fix it, do something different to save the job.

7346
07:33:07,711 --> 07:33:10,304
It is how they did it. Or, or, like them,

7347
07:33:10,332 --> 07:33:13,051
like what they're saying, is that it comes in honor and is action.

7348
07:33:13,052 --> 07:33:17,630
You know, it's only planned in my production scene point that we're only going

7349
07:33:17,631 --> 07:33:19,955
to be three days worth of the word, right?

7350
07:33:19,956 --> 07:33:22,145
And that's the right word. Alright, man. The floor tested mass,

7351
07:33:22,146 --> 07:33:25,406
I thought it, and not going into it, but thinking that it didn't even

7352
07:33:25,407 --> 07:33:28,165
play down or swear. Okay, I didn't,

7353
07:33:28,166 --> 07:33:30,526
you know. Don't. Don't. The guys are going to now have,

7354
07:33:30,782 --> 07:33:33,826
you know, five days to do it. It should actually push them so they're

7355
07:33:33,827 --> 07:33:36,999
three, but I don't have to work on the two guys in the max.

7356
07:33:37,000 --> 07:33:37,111
Bye bye.

7357
07:33:41,584 --> 07:33:45,091
I don't, I don't want to tell the shot.

7358
07:33:45,092 --> 07:33:49,741
How many buzzers do you guys rehab for the next three to six

7359
07:33:49,742 --> 07:33:53,071
months? Yeah. And then run it and see what it comes.

7360
07:33:53,072 --> 07:33:58,280
It comes out to be and then compare it to the estimated

7361
07:33:58,281 --> 07:34:00,711
and adjusted. I trust

7362
07:34:09,091 --> 07:34:11,618
I don't know if people are going to come up with the weight each

7363
07:34:11,619 --> 07:34:14,380
year. They're going to sit up. Yeah, I'm going to go over on this

7364
07:34:14,381 --> 07:34:17,131
channel. So I'm going to take some of those out of me.

7365
07:34:17,132 --> 07:34:19,372
I'm going to do a job because I think I'm going to do that.

7366
07:34:19,534 --> 07:34:21,396
You can see it in the system too. Yeah. But I bet they do

7367
07:34:21,399 --> 07:34:24,960
it either. This here.

7368
07:34:24,961 --> 07:34:28,187
And appreciate it. I it. Thank you. And you. I just think tackle is

7369
07:34:28,188 --> 07:34:31,104
important. You can make changes.

7370
07:34:31,105 --> 07:34:33,647
Yeah. I don't.

7371
07:34:33,648 --> 07:34:37,433
you Thank you.

7372
07:34:41,125 --> 07:34:45,179
I don't think you're here. . . I don't you're here.

7373
07:34:46,190 --> 07:34:50,723
I don't like the

7374
07:34:50,724 --> 07:34:53,408
sweet. We think I'm, I'm seeing with what I had here,

7375
07:34:53,409 --> 07:34:57,132
but I don't really trust for that. No, I don't think I'd see when

7376
07:34:57,133 --> 07:34:59,620
it's bad or hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a,

7377
07:34:59,621 --> 07:35:02,941
it's a, it's a lot of student business. I mean, it's a couple years

7378
07:35:02,942 --> 07:35:05,332
worth of usually I'll be just a group of people on the platform,

7379
07:35:05,488 --> 07:35:08,798
so, good. Get a shot, kind of. I always had a relaxing change,

7380
07:35:09,632 --> 07:35:11,781
but we both have a challenge, like,

7381
07:35:11,816 --> 07:35:15,091
what we do on this fight, and fight by doing it in the,

7382
07:35:19,868 --> 07:35:24,676
It's generally not too far out of It was okay to

7383
07:35:24,677 --> 07:35:28,756
me, I would just keep running with it, but get some really good data

7384
07:35:29,012 --> 07:35:31,111
to come back and change it. Yeah, I agree.

7385
07:35:34,323 --> 07:35:37,189
I'm not scared of being a whole child.

7386
07:35:37,190 --> 07:35:40,154
I'm gonna be scared to run a bit, but. Okay. Let me,

7387
07:35:40,170 --> 07:35:42,746
one of the smaller used calls are going to seem better to use it.

7388
07:35:44,499 --> 07:35:46,390
And then. But you, but you, but have one over and that's okay with

7389
07:35:46,391 --> 07:35:48,787
these. But there's just,

7390
07:35:48,788 --> 07:35:51,510
you do not. Okay, so I, you know, you have consistency.

7391
07:35:51,511 --> 07:35:53,587
It's not what we got. So far,

7392
07:35:53,588 --> 07:35:55,822
I had to make the decision. . . Like that.

7393
07:35:55,823 --> 07:35:55,600
Good.

7394
07:36:04,111 --> 07:36:06,373
Well, even with the change,

7395
07:36:06,388 --> 07:36:10,793
you know, they're probably located versus five hours,

7396
07:36:10,794 --> 07:36:13,576
uh, or day south. With the production,

7397
07:36:13,577 --> 07:36:15,793
uhm,

7398
07:36:15,804 --> 07:36:19,787
we can inform our leads on base hours.

7399
07:36:19,893 --> 07:36:22,131
and so on. Instead of originally estimated,

7400
07:36:22,497 --> 07:36:26,215
you can give them the goal below what was actually estimated.

7401
07:36:26,794 --> 07:36:29,211
See if they can hit that goal. Inaudible. If they can.

7402
07:36:29,727 --> 07:36:33,798
Because right now, we're classing on the big board of the shop.

7403
07:36:33,799 --> 07:36:36,331
This is no mercy air for this. It's no mercy air for this.

7404
07:36:36,332 --> 07:36:38,425
It's the sound you haven't seen in this. Yeah.

7405
07:36:38,533 --> 07:36:43,107
We use it. So we undercut that goal and we're always

7406
07:36:43,108 --> 07:36:45,794
shooting for something slightly. okay I'll take I've been bit less than what we

7407
07:36:45,795 --> 07:36:48,941
have. As long as we know we've recovered a budget lives with what's estimated,

7408
07:36:49,301 --> 07:36:51,671
then it don't matter what we're telling them they have to do it.

7409
07:36:51,913 --> 07:36:54,634
Yeah. Mhm. And it didn't make a budget until what they have to do

7410
07:36:54,635 --> 07:36:58,217
it again. And then from there it's a set of hunchiever bowlers,

7411
07:36:58,440 --> 07:37:00,456
or you can actually. Thank you very much.

7412
07:37:00,457 --> 07:37:02,701
Yeah. So, cause that's definitely,

7413
07:37:02,702 --> 07:37:07,366
and we can do that on the work

7414
07:37:07,367 --> 07:37:11,663
package. Bye. You know, I think at the end of the day,

7415
07:37:11,664 --> 07:37:14,259
we take out a good motivation factor,

7416
07:37:14,260 --> 07:37:16,531
like this. We,

7417
07:37:16,532 --> 07:37:19,036
As, as from, uh,

7418
07:37:19,047 --> 07:37:24,022
me and it's the same, like, cap to double what the actual

7419
07:37:24,023 --> 07:37:28,302
art is. . Right, like, there's so many times the estimator is being skid,

7420
07:37:28,495 --> 07:37:31,774
and you start going through this, like, I have no idea what all this

7421
07:37:31,775 --> 07:37:34,855
intensity can see. Like, you start putting this up in,

7422
07:37:34,856 --> 07:37:38,811
and you don't have no idea what your true actuals are together.

7423
07:37:39,185 --> 07:37:43,775
You have to get some sort of- comparability of what to the shot actually

7424
07:37:43,776 --> 07:37:46,450
would be. It's you know, right, you know, at the end of the day,

7425
07:37:46,645 --> 07:37:48,660
when we're self-delivered, it's your motivation to to the- .

7426
07:37:48,691 --> 07:37:53,031
Or, like, what it is, it'll be happy to be comfortable with what to

7427
07:37:53,032 --> 07:37:55,563
the shot actually puts. Okay,

7428
07:37:55,564 --> 07:37:58,080
the finish goes into- I mean,

7429
07:37:58,081 --> 07:38:00,211
it's a big picture of when, you know,

7430
07:38:00,277 --> 07:38:03,570
we're putting it 16,000 times instead of the shot.

7431
07:38:03,892 --> 07:38:06,775
So, w- You know what I'm saying? Right. So,

7432
07:38:06,776 --> 07:38:09,095
uh, it might keep me actually doing it, right?

7433
07:38:09,096 --> 07:38:11,296
Like, do a thousand, you know,

7434
07:38:11,297 --> 07:38:15,876
um, so. So. One, like what an effort is going to be comfortable with

7435
07:38:15,877 --> 07:38:18,311
it. The sales side,

7436
07:38:18,315 --> 07:38:21,064
I mean, that's the easy side. But. We'll see you know,

7437
07:38:21,065 --> 07:38:23,447
but then you want to deal with it. But we need you're comfortable with

7438
07:38:23,448 --> 07:38:27,680
what we actually didn't do.

7439
07:38:27,681 --> 07:38:30,287
Right? Okay. Okay. Let's see. You're sorry. You're sorry.

7440
07:38:30,970 --> 07:38:33,273
Bunching beans and getting away from, you know,

7441
07:38:33,327 --> 07:38:36,632
what would sell it for us, didn't it? It gets very confusing here.

7442
07:38:36,633 --> 07:38:41,345
I need- I want to lose sight of what our being actually

7443
07:38:41,633 --> 07:38:44,580
production . .

7444
07:38:44,971 --> 07:38:48,372
I'd bet a $16,000 that use working towards them.

7445
07:38:48,649 --> 07:38:51,886
I think so. The MCthink is the-ass,

7446
07:38:51,887 --> 07:38:53,960
or whatever. They're big.

7447
07:38:54,898 --> 07:38:58,177
In, uh, we didn't see you over,

7448
07:38:58,178 --> 07:39:01,051
but I didn't see you over to the side then. And it was the

7449
07:39:01,052 --> 07:39:04,447
Yeah, they're very important to that.

7450
07:39:04,448 --> 07:39:07,481
I guess production means that you can get an else.

7451
07:39:07,630 --> 07:39:11,705
And I mean, then besides We have developed one inch points here.

7452
07:39:12,608 --> 07:39:16,524
And then we have the dual spices, multiple dual spices to the rear.

7453
07:39:16,905 --> 07:39:19,006
Thank you. So, um, have the rooters,

7454
07:39:19,007 --> 07:39:21,010
like, 74 feet. So we have the,

7455
07:39:21,011 --> 07:39:23,985
uh, the, the goodness of the footer. And you have the bottle too.

7456
07:39:24,025 --> 07:39:27,626
Then we have the hookup. You over to the 16th footer and the long

7457
07:39:27,985 --> 07:39:30,644
top. And then we have another specific piece.

7458
07:39:32,347 --> 07:39:36,589
Break the schedule. I feel, It's about, very looked at.

7459
07:39:36,590 --> 07:39:39,376
The schedule was to get drawings in November and to get them to November

7460
07:39:39,377 --> 07:39:42,831
and March. Yeah, very good. There's 7,000 tons in March.

7461
07:39:42,965 --> 07:39:45,231
Yeah. Okay, I don't even know if they're coded.

7462
07:39:45,929 --> 07:39:48,752
If they're coded, they're coded. I don't think they're coded.

7463
07:39:48,753 --> 07:39:51,144
I don't have that okay, interesting.

7464
07:39:51,596 --> 07:39:53,743
Something that big one would probably aspire for.

7465
07:39:53,744 --> 07:39:57,966
I think. So, um. Don't forget to ask them.

7466
07:39:59,382 --> 07:40:01,624
The estimator or the GC?

7467
07:40:01,941 --> 07:40:04,539
That's good. Uh, I think for answer.

7468
07:40:04,540 --> 07:40:07,290
All right. Good. Just, um, yeah. Mm hm.

7469
07:40:07,301 --> 07:40:10,542
Probably some of these other instructions, uh,

7470
07:40:10,553 --> 07:40:13,315
described a long case of-

7471
07:40:21,451 --> 07:40:23,955
Um. Adjustment?

7472
07:40:24,395 --> 07:40:28,638
Yeah, that makes sense. Give me that change month.

7473
07:40:28,639 --> 07:40:30,904
Give me what you need to- What do I mean here?

7474
07:40:30,905 --> 07:40:33,335
Are you leaving here? Umm, I need you to go out here in a

7475
07:40:33,336 --> 07:40:36,315
few minutes. I've heard you're buying- You and I should have a quick talk

7476
07:40:36,316 --> 07:40:40,198
about the 2020 departure. Watch There's too many people saying it's not my job.

7477
07:40:40,429 --> 07:40:42,896
Oh, yeah. I have a feeling you're the decision-maker here.

7478
07:40:43,159 --> 07:40:45,571
I'm not gonna see. Ha-ha.

7479
07:40:45,572 --> 07:40:48,178
That's the person. That's the question.

7480
07:40:48,179 --> 07:40:50,807
Anybody, Jeff has the coupons? Just so you know.

7481
07:40:50,848 --> 07:40:53,616
Right. So he's got it. We just didn't do what to do.

7482
07:40:53,617 --> 07:40:57,236
So, uh,

7483
07:40:57,247 --> 07:41:00,515
yeah. I would say no one's gonna make a decision.

7484
07:41:00,516 --> 07:41:04,516
I say we, we pass. All right. I'm actually a prep of the actual

7485
07:41:04,650 --> 07:41:06,947
fitment that we're gonna do, which is just a single edge,

7486
07:41:07,412 --> 07:41:09,691
right? And then running as a T.G. in cognitive.

7487
07:41:09,692 --> 07:41:11,992
That's what the guys are gonna do, okay?

7488
07:41:12,123 --> 07:41:14,978
Are they gonna get, I don't want, Are we done with this?

7489
07:41:15,226 --> 07:41:17,741
Maybe you and I have a little side, side marker? Yeah. Alright.

7490
07:41:17,277 --> 07:41:19,821
Alright. Uh,

7491
07:41:19,831 --> 07:41:24,027
what's the local national's? If pervert or tomorrow is not gonna take my athlete's

7492
07:41:24,028 --> 07:41:27,093
self spreadsheet, I'm gonna take him to believe that. We'll have to match what

7493
07:41:27,094 --> 07:41:31,655
we have on the figure out what we need to

7494
07:41:31,712 --> 07:41:36,288
do. So we're gonna finally- do a practicing grip on that.

7495
07:41:36,526 --> 07:41:38,645
And obviously, I know that actually I was,

7496
07:41:38,680 --> 07:41:41,820
like I said, coming up with some- some- I'm going to back to the

7497
07:41:41,851 --> 07:41:45,577
some way that we start gripping these things to get bigger,

7498
07:41:45,578 --> 07:41:49,891
because when we- long, long, I'm going to back to the- what are the-

7499
07:41:49,892 --> 07:41:52,706
the approach that we had is- is you group a cut list on,

7500
07:41:52,707 --> 07:41:55,051
and- and even if you group a cut list,

7501
07:41:55,468 --> 07:41:59,675
and you say, okay. Thank It's a good sample to have over it,

7502
07:42:01,188 --> 07:42:03,587
or do you talk about it? Just having to get it right on the

7503
07:42:03,588 --> 07:42:05,971
paper, and just say, hey, I started out a hoo hoo.

7504
07:42:05,972 --> 07:42:08,018
. I started 8.03. I got, uh,

7505
07:42:08,029 --> 07:42:10,080
pen 15, right? And then it, it, it,

7506
07:42:10,317 --> 07:42:12,895
something I can come back and release some stats of paper,

7507
07:42:13,186 --> 07:42:15,212
something can come. And you can have some,

7508
07:42:15,571 --> 07:42:18,656
you know, there, you guys are bored, so we've got this all the time.

7509
07:42:19,090 --> 07:42:21,374
And then, then you can take, you can buy that out and say that

7510
07:42:21,375 --> 07:42:23,767
they don't just tell them. So, there are 75 cases in the guy that

7511
07:42:23,768 --> 07:42:26,369
have got any four minutes. You can check it.

7512
07:42:26,636 --> 07:42:29,589
So, the, the basic catch. Yeah.

7513
07:42:29,696 --> 07:42:34,026
Go ahead. And, and tomorrow or two, whatever you get that wall imported in,

7514
07:42:34,398 --> 07:42:38,131
I think it would be kind of careful for us to run it from-

7515
07:42:38,132 --> 07:42:40,471
the room, purchase it,

7516
07:42:40,962 --> 07:42:43,196
do a cutness, process the cutness,

7517
07:42:43,197 --> 07:42:46,140
do the receding, just to make sure there's no other h- .

7518
07:42:46,141 --> 07:42:51,534
We can run through that pretty

7519
07:42:51,535 --> 07:42:55,425
quickly. How do I expect to be here?

7520
07:42:55,821 --> 07:42:57,914
Yeah. Yeah. Everything I've got is gonna be better than stuff. And then it's

7521
07:42:57,915 --> 07:43:00,189
all, all the evening, you know. Yeah, it's, it's. David,

7522
07:43:00,190 --> 07:43:02,280
thanks. Thanks, David. And wanna thank We'll see And we'll see And we'll be

7523
07:43:02,311 --> 07:43:05,248
have some, I think, some of them. It depends on the approach,

7524
07:43:05,249 --> 07:43:08,079
but I like that. I think that's it,

7525
07:43:08,080 --> 07:43:10,047
David. I think that's it. I'm in jail. I'll see you in the next

7526
07:43:10,048 --> 07:43:12,205
I mean, yeah.

7527
07:43:12,758 --> 07:43:15,960
It'll fire your fire. If your project's in there,

7528
07:43:15,961 --> 07:43:18,331
I know I'm saying no need to go. Sorry, stop.

7529
07:43:18,332 --> 07:43:20,725
I can't blame anybody for supporting me. You're just from there,

7530
07:43:20,726 --> 07:43:23,902
it's really, you put it in there or I have a new job,

7531
07:43:23,903 --> 07:43:26,371
because it only happens when you've gotten invigorated.

7532
07:43:26,372 --> 07:43:29,506
Umm, well, it's not the same, but it's definitely the same kind of thing.

7533
07:43:29,507 --> 07:43:32,742
We have jobs. Retail companies are very important.

7534
07:43:32,743 --> 07:43:35,973
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not actually working,

7535
07:43:35,974 --> 07:43:38,265
they're all changing. Yeah, yeah. Or yeah,

7536
07:43:38,266 --> 07:43:42,451
artisans. And uhh, uhh, uhh, people do it on the board these months.

7537
07:43:46,316 --> 07:43:48,417
So, we're doing too least a stack,

7538
07:43:48,418 --> 07:43:48,939
right? And so, they're going to listen to a battery and go on and

7539
07:43:48,940 --> 07:43:51,802
blow you some champagne. Thank Uhh, let's listen to the units.

7540
07:43:51,803 --> 07:43:55,215
Hey, there, there are. I can get familiar with the units back.

7541
07:43:55,246 --> 07:43:57,347
So, uh,

7542
07:43:57,358 --> 07:44:00,886
I that's easy. Why don't we- That's not something we can be guys trying

7543
07:44:01,795 --> 07:44:04,319
to get the schrapping. That's no doubt. Yeah.

7544
07:44:04,578 --> 07:44:07,848
Where is the unit on that look? We're headed, Is it-installed?

7545
07:44:07,849 --> 07:44:11,188
Is it pre-installed by Mr. Jones? I think it's not even this job.

7546
07:44:11,189 --> 07:44:14,611
It's good here. The bar is cutting back and that's the second section.

7547
07:44:14,612 --> 07:44:16,770
No, no, no, no, no. Just, uh, just, uh, No, just,

7548
07:44:17,255 --> 07:44:19,628
you know, uh, it's, uh, it's real, not just a- not real,

7549
07:44:19,629 --> 07:44:22,651
not really. I can't do it- it's just.

7550
07:44:22,652 --> 07:44:25,018
. ...I deserve- hmm, you want? It's a second.

7551
07:44:25,019 --> 07:44:27,854
I just shut the equipment, it's such fun to be using guns,

7552
07:44:27,855 --> 07:44:30,691
you know, it's being guns and just- I think that- Thank you.

7553
07:44:30,692 --> 07:44:32,722
I don't know how to say that,

7554
07:44:32,723 --> 07:44:35,183
but you can write the funny things that are ignorant,

7555
07:44:35,550 --> 07:44:38,251
because they put the relax with that on the inside or on the other

7556
07:44:38,252 --> 07:44:40,650
side. It's the consensus to get up,

7557
07:44:40,651 --> 07:44:44,323
because it's virtual, because everyone I was seeing is meeting 12th-day images,

7558
07:44:44,324 --> 07:44:46,408
and it's going to be third-day at home. And,

7559
07:44:46,409 --> 07:44:48,930
uh, And the biggest thing, like, it would just slide in,

7560
07:44:48,931 --> 07:44:51,974
and then you got to come up at the end,

7561
07:44:51,975 --> 07:44:54,400
and you got to back and forth there, and it's all, it's a thousand

7562
07:44:54,401 --> 07:44:58,911
years old. I

7563
07:44:58,912 --> 07:45:01,185
don't get it,

7564
07:45:01,186 --> 07:45:01,907
because, like, these are how we're resulting. Yeah. I don't even get typed together.

7565
07:45:02,142 --> 07:45:04,192
Okay. I'm to see what this is inside.

7566
07:45:04,591 --> 07:45:06,922
Cause I'm going to all this. I'm going to need it. He's going to

7567
07:45:06,926 --> 07:45:09,278
lay right away. I'm going to go back and battle.

7568
07:45:09,293 --> 07:45:11,909
That's going to be forget. Okay, thank you. Uh, I'm going to lay it

7569
07:45:11,910 --> 07:45:15,035
in 40 now. I'm going to take a look at this.

7570
07:45:15,532 --> 07:45:17,838
So I'm going to take a look at it. So I'm going to show

7571
07:45:17,839 --> 07:45:19,991
it to the customer. Well, that's one way.

7572
07:45:19,992 --> 07:45:22,060
Now, we have some rows.

7573
07:45:22,061 --> 07:45:24,390
I don't know how much you might have made from Genesis. And yes,

7574
07:45:24,391 --> 07:45:26,976
it was within 2000. that of. that's what was saying.

7575
07:45:26,977 --> 07:45:29,938
I don't know. It's, uh, yeah, two pieces. I'm going take out this one.

7576
07:45:30,294 --> 07:45:34,131
I'm going to make a huge list of the guys' walks here in the

7577
07:45:34,132 --> 07:45:36,162
dwellers' booth. You have it. If it works,

7578
07:45:36,163 --> 07:45:39,084
spin it up. Yeah, so, uh, isn't you running the intake?

7579
07:45:39,085 --> 07:45:41,157
Why don't you just say it down to a vote? Well, I don't think

7580
07:45:41,201 --> 07:45:43,486
it's always back with me about you. Thank you. Actually,

7581
07:45:43,511 --> 07:45:46,228
I've heard that it's, uh, the best measure is still going to pick it

7582
07:45:46,229 --> 07:45:49,127
up a sentence. Okay, so, yeah, I just don't have a problem with the

7583
07:45:49,141 --> 07:45:51,016
bullet that they've actually put back to.

7584
07:45:59,131 --> 07:46:03,882
Umm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm. I'm going to break this if you

7585
07:46:03,883 --> 07:46:07,171
haven't seen it.

7586
07:46:07,172 --> 07:46:11,463
Umm, ehm, ehm, ehm. But I'm a graduate,

7587
07:46:11,511 --> 07:46:13,979
I'm a I'm a I'm a It's all I've done since I was born

7588
07:46:13,980 --> 07:46:16,058
five years. Nice and late. Umm, ehm,

7589
07:46:16,059 --> 07:46:18,494
ehm, ehm, ehm,

7590
07:46:19,072 --> 07:46:19,636
ehm.

7591
07:46:26,745 --> 07:46:27,596
So, uh, I kind of have to say, right? So, as long as you

7592
07:46:27,597 --> 07:46:29,601
have to become 50% everyday out there,

7593
07:46:29,602 --> 07:46:35,743
or just like, get this part of somewhere, is That's

7594
07:46:35,744 --> 07:46:41,757
one of the

7595
07:46:41,758 --> 07:46:46,757
United.

7596
07:46:47,020 --> 07:46:50,751
I'm going to go ahead I think I'm in pleasure with the Vietnam time

7597
07:46:50,752 --> 07:46:53,827
studies and all that side over there. I'm going to give it an essentially

7598
07:46:53,828 --> 07:46:54,579
need to have. Yeah.

7599
07:47:03,451 --> 07:47:07,381
That's you know, I don't know not something that I have job,

7600
07:47:07,382 --> 07:47:09,524
but it's not something that I can It's not something that I yeah,

7601
07:47:09,525 --> 07:47:10,403
I job. It's inside of it, I get shocked, but it's fine with it.

7602
07:47:10,404 --> 07:47:12,173
I don't think my name is so. . . I'm sure it stays on

7603
07:47:12,174 --> 07:47:15,065
it. You've never kind of lived.

7604
07:47:15,066 --> 07:47:17,707
I don't know. They don't get bothered even if they ask about staff.

7605
07:47:17,708 --> 07:47:20,622
Okay, that's great. Now I'm nice to wish I But no,

7606
07:47:20,623 --> 07:47:23,107
the program you're using, it's almost.

7607
07:47:23,108 --> 07:47:25,338
You don't have to go back and forth. Okay,

7608
07:47:25,663 --> 07:47:27,850
you'll just send one, uh! I've got,

7609
07:47:27,863 --> 07:47:30,706
I didn't even need to compare it to them, so I sexually used to

7610
07:47:30,708 --> 07:47:33,845
go to Ben Hall and, uh, and go right in to the inside,

7611
07:47:33,846 --> 07:47:37,108
because of the alphabet about labels. I didn't have any of these patterns that

7612
07:47:37,264 --> 07:47:40,252
weren't used to me, I should really collect what I think of it all

7613
07:47:40,253 --> 07:47:42,408
to me. He's had the theories when he asked me.

7614
07:47:42,606 --> 07:47:45,301
I didn't see any of these. I was thinking about it on that table.

7615
07:47:45,532 --> 07:47:48,282
Yeah. And I think- You know what, I just think we have done sometimes.

7616
07:47:48,283 --> 07:47:50,351
We need to be able to buy it in a little shot. I'm not

7617
07:47:50,433 --> 07:47:52,902
going to just buy it in the other way. Yeah. Do you know that

7618
07:47:52,903 --> 07:47:55,435
we're going to the Canadian side? Because of all that charity.

7619
07:47:55,436 --> 07:47:57,586
It's one group kind of long, eh?

7620
07:47:57,879 --> 07:48:00,685
The ones that I expect are- I don't need to be skeptical of the

7621
07:48:00,686 --> 07:48:03,998
way. I need to get their own direction inside of the business.

7622
07:48:04,010 --> 07:48:05,874
Yeah, all of it. They need to be used to be in case it

7623
07:48:05,875 --> 07:48:07,536
was a push to all of the cost. All right, we'll see you week.

7624
07:48:07,537 --> 07:48:10,090
Now, we are interested in something that is,

7625
07:48:10,091 --> 07:48:13,422
uh, the thing that nobody else can accept from the government to be on

7626
07:48:13,423 --> 07:48:15,517
this stuff. Uh, so, they are on a,

7627
07:48:23,561 --> 07:48:26,811
Umm, uhh, uhh, hmmm. and the 11th message gave the name.

7628
07:48:27,290 --> 07:48:30,833
That, we have the states that we're going to be president if they're not

7629
07:48:30,834 --> 07:48:33,413
going to have much love. Maybe you should all know how to do the

7630
07:48:33,414 --> 07:48:36,820
program, the excels, and ex-creatives that are planning So,

7631
07:48:36,821 --> 07:48:38,200
shut those all in. It's not a big part of the community, it's not

7632
07:48:38,201 --> 07:48:42,090
a big part community, it's a big of the community. It's a big part

7633
07:48:42,091 --> 07:48:44,973
of the community. It's a big part of It's a big part of the

7634
07:48:45,078 --> 07:48:47,396
community. Take this back here,

7635
07:48:47,397 --> 07:48:49,417
Tom. It's a part of it.

7636
07:48:49,418 --> 07:48:53,958
It's a big part of it. It's a big part of

7637
07:48:54,173 --> 07:48:57,833
it. I thing is that you haven't done it for me so I know

7638
07:48:57,834 --> 07:49:00,223
they've got some anxiety. If you're not going to be waiting,

7639
07:49:00,537 --> 07:49:02,846
especially outerson about you, who screwed it up,

7640
07:49:02,847 --> 07:49:05,064
you know. I am, uh,

7641
07:49:05,074 --> 07:49:07,143
there are just a lot of feelings in this.

7642
07:49:07,334 --> 07:49:09,340
There is a lot of truth.

7643
07:49:09,563 --> 07:49:11,611
He's only, I think, presenting. Thank sir.

7644
07:49:11,612 --> 07:49:14,706
And there's a lot of reasons why I got to do it.

7645
07:49:14,707 --> 07:49:16,730
I think it's one of the things that I know it's going to be

7646
07:49:16,731 --> 07:49:19,319
challenging to me. It's going sharp line, so we can get fixed.

7647
07:49:19,320 --> 07:49:21,447
I'm just going to, We're in some other, We're thought the laser is going

7648
07:49:21,448 --> 07:49:21,940
to be anticipated.

7649
07:49:40,277 --> 07:49:40,884
I think that's a lot of reasons to come in here, so I think

7650
07:49:40,885 --> 07:49:43,651
it's a good word. with me.

7651
07:49:43,652 --> 07:49:47,593
I'm gonna bring this thing out here, and this place is the next place,

7652
07:49:47,594 --> 07:49:51,631
the U.S.S.K. All of these same and high states with my own shares.

7653
07:49:51,632 --> 07:49:54,949
They're really starting to scratch it out. It does not say it's important,

7654
07:49:54,950 --> 07:49:59,195
and we're really good times. It always takes the name of this account saying,

7655
07:49:59,196 --> 07:50:01,962
make sure. Alright guys, we hope I don't put it right here in the

7656
07:50:01,963 --> 07:50:04,462
time stays, but we're through so much. That's it,

7657
07:50:04,463 --> 07:50:07,080
we're starting to put out 50 seconds a day. Great,

7658
07:50:07,081 --> 07:50:09,707
so we know- We have an answer,

7659
07:50:09,708 --> 07:50:11,726
and the answer is, can you use that, right?

7660
07:50:11,727 --> 07:50:15,631
It's a seal though. It's a little different. It's a little different.

7661
07:50:15,632 --> 07:50:17,845
It's the way we do it. Yeah.

7662
07:50:18,001 --> 07:50:19,795
You're gonna hang me last time. Right. You know, talk to me later. Bring

7663
07:50:19,796 --> 07:50:24,363
the laundry on. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. I'm going ahead and I think

7664
07:50:24,364 --> 07:50:26,632
that they're alive. Yeah, and Steve's thoughts.

7665
07:50:26,644 --> 07:50:29,461
We were deserved to be here.

7666
07:50:29,462 --> 07:50:32,500
Thank you. Thank And the job,

7667
07:50:32,550 --> 07:50:36,637
Dila, I'm part To ourselves and do more work against us here tonight.

7668
07:50:36,933 --> 07:50:38,715
We'll be nice to meet you guys and see you along with them. I'm

7669
07:50:38,716 --> 07:50:41,161
part of what I'm doing. We're taking a moment of fighting.

7670
07:50:41,162 --> 07:50:45,859
So we're like, I hate flying us on the ground in the work that

7671
07:50:45,860 --> 07:50:49,557
they're doing. I hope At least they have a 6-minute event.

7672
07:50:49,634 --> 07:50:52,043
And also a great day. I'm telling you, you know,

7673
07:50:52,044 --> 07:50:54,270
the girl is definitely a bright community. I just,

7674
07:50:54,326 --> 07:50:58,992
I guess, the bottle is due to the- and it's important that it's hanging

7675
07:50:58,993 --> 07:51:01,586
apart from the back, which is the exact same thing.

7676
07:51:01,587 --> 07:51:03,696
Oh, wow. our friends.

7677
07:51:03,697 --> 07:51:05,839
and I'll agree is that when you move this thing, I like to do

7678
07:51:05,840 --> 07:51:10,684
it. We got the solids, and and then we have 2,000.

7679
07:51:10,685 --> 07:51:12,696
And then this one. It's not,

7680
07:51:12,704 --> 07:51:14,948
it's like, if we don't have some various applause,

7681
07:51:14,949 --> 07:51:17,255
it's really good. It's, it's a good skill.

7682
07:51:17,256 --> 07:51:19,279
It's really good. It's a great very,

7683
07:51:19,280 --> 07:51:22,110
very That we don't have to be able to spark around and just finish

7684
07:51:22,111 --> 07:51:24,680
like this. Like, the exterior open,

7685
07:51:24,681 --> 07:51:26,626
well, I think we should stick with blood. Yeah, it is. It's very good.

7686
07:51:26,627 --> 07:51:29,113
I'm coming All right. You're to be in the department of addition.

7687
07:51:29,489 --> 07:51:32,140
As soon as it stays later, I want to know when I'm going to

7688
07:51:32,141 --> 07:51:35,139
reach the convenience of him. So I'm having this kind of schedule to be

7689
07:51:35,140 --> 07:51:38,284
back. You better. That's it. We need to have this similar kind of questions.

7690
07:51:38,285 --> 07:51:41,088
At least I'm meeting them next year in the office.

7691
07:51:41,452 --> 07:51:43,771
Let's give it a new thing up there. We'll do it forever.

7692
07:51:43,772 --> 07:51:45,811
We can, uhm, we're supposed to speak any more.

7693
07:51:45,812 --> 07:51:49,191
You can't listen to the parliamentary statement about it.

7694
07:51:49,846 --> 07:51:51,607
So we're going to go on the dice, but we're going to think we're

7695
07:51:51,608 --> 07:51:54,111
going to, just going to end up wasting the, uhh, the most familiar in

7696
07:51:54,112 --> 07:51:58,460
the air is starting the ball. Yeah. So I'm going to ask you,

7697
07:51:58,530 --> 07:52:00,685
okay, I'm going to ask you, I mean, if I just,

7698
07:52:00,686 --> 07:52:03,630
I'll take it. You better play it. It's going to throw it in.

7699
07:52:03,989 --> 07:52:07,456
I don't like trying to call it listen. I want to tell you both

7700
07:52:07,457 --> 07:52:10,514
songs. Come on guys. You know, you're better than me.

7701
07:52:10,515 --> 07:52:15,751
That's what I said.

7702
07:52:15,752 --> 07:52:17,979
. Next morning, we should go to the city. So, uhm,

7703
07:52:17,990 --> 07:52:21,882
finally, on the interior, the same way that we created drugs here in Vermont

7704
07:52:21,883 --> 07:52:24,968
and Foxport. Yeah, that was the end of the video. It's not to understand.

7705
07:52:24,969 --> 07:52:27,813
It's not easy to trust our guys, but, you know, otherwise you need one.

7706
07:52:27,814 --> 07:52:30,206
I think it's got fat and anxiety. I don't know.

7707
07:52:30,257 --> 07:52:33,120
I don't know. Good night. It's been a couple of days,

7708
07:52:33,121 --> 07:52:36,457
but it's a lot of steps to say, you know, let's just do what

7709
07:52:36,458 --> 07:52:38,574
the guys can do, and that's where, uh,

7710
07:52:38,584 --> 07:52:39,811
my, my, my. Thank you.

7711
07:52:55,776 --> 07:52:58,245
I think name I've looked at, uh,

7712
07:52:58,255 --> 07:53:02,046
what's the possible office that I've known as? I think it's currently analyzed in

7713
07:53:02,047 --> 07:53:05,121
English to me, but I'll see ya. and I mean,

7714
07:53:05,122 --> 07:53:07,209
I mean, I want something to do with the design,

7715
07:53:07,210 --> 07:53:09,159
I can't just say that that's just a lot of office. I mean, that's

7716
07:53:09,160 --> 07:53:11,465
not a lot of, because there's a lot of studio that's focused on that.

7717
07:53:11,531 --> 07:53:13,582
Okay, let's. Well, hi. I'm an old-time speaker.

7718
07:53:13,583 --> 07:53:16,250
I'm a shoot man, and I'm a dedicated speaker. I mean, just still loves

7719
07:53:16,299 --> 07:53:18,354
as much as my animals and stuff like this. Couple of things.

7720
07:53:18,355 --> 07:53:20,395
Yeah, same. You get Right. Right. Okay. Thank you. You know, I can dig

7721
07:53:20,396 --> 07:53:22,910
everything. I uh, it throws you next to this bolt.

7722
07:53:22,911 --> 07:53:25,424
Just that. Let's just put it in the same component. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

7723
07:53:25,425 --> 07:53:27,459
Mm Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

7725
07:53:33,066 --> 07:53:35,851
Mm-hmm.

7726
07:53:35,852 --> 07:53:37,246
Mm-hmm.

7727
07:53:43,836 --> 07:53:46,960
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

7728
07:53:47,461 --> 07:53:51,871
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

7729
07:53:49,146 --> 07:53:51,871
Mm-hmm.

7730
07:53:51,872 --> 07:53:59,820
Mm-hmm. Mm

7731
07:53:55,165 --> 07:53:59,851

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

7736
07:54:31,891 --> 07:54:34,597
But it's a different person, or if you are in the case,

7737
07:54:34,598 --> 07:54:37,031
please send out to me. All selected. Yeah.

7738
07:54:37,138 --> 07:54:39,876
So, my point is that,

7739
07:54:39,877 --> 07:54:43,400
It's good. And the whole process is not,

7740
07:54:43,401 --> 07:54:47,186
And being sure I'm already on the wall because it's having a little bit

7741
07:54:47,187 --> 07:54:50,084
of a, And I think we're getting here this way.

7742
07:54:50,244 --> 07:54:53,493
You've got to do it down on the ground or something like that.

7743
07:54:53,494 --> 07:54:55,891
You know, understanding how,

7744
07:54:59,777 --> 07:55:04,111
umm, umm,

7745
07:55:09,587 --> 07:55:10,594
umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm, umm,

7746
07:55:10,595 --> 07:55:10,626
umm,

7747
07:55:17,700 --> 07:55:18,009
umm, umm, umm, umm, umm,

7748
07:55:23,751 --> 07:55:26,346
I've been saying black salt or that's what I've just seen. 54 years dont

7749
07:55:26,347 --> 07:55:28,406
know if its content right now. Like,

7750
07:55:28,423 --> 07:55:30,471
so you have to look from what's here, they got a leech and then,

7751
07:55:30,472 --> 07:55:33,081
you know, I think I'm gonna have to bring the lead days to my

7752
07:55:33,082 --> 07:55:35,766
seventh night, uh, ass, play, and look, and really hear us,

7753
07:55:35,767 --> 07:55:36,096
you know.

7754
07:55:52,116 --> 07:55:54,478
Yes, there is no bad plan to change it.

7755
07:55:54,479 --> 07:55:56,562
Then I brought them all to us to take a walk.

7756
07:55:56,563 --> 07:55:59,180
Man, I know that a hell of a time, Travis. I'm not used by

7757
07:55:59,181 --> 07:56:01,220
a virus, excuse me. I don't care. I need you to, like,

7758
07:56:01,415 --> 07:56:03,171
damage the player to me. I don't even care if we have to ask

7759
07:56:03,172 --> 07:56:05,883
them all if they're innocent and you don't care. Pick a ball,

7760
07:56:05,884 --> 07:56:08,136
you can't even use a purpose very much.

7761
07:56:08,137 --> 07:56:10,594
You don't get a back hand for that,

7762
07:56:10,595 --> 07:56:12,705
but yeah, you don't flick. Yeah,

7763
07:56:12,706 --> 07:56:15,364
so it goes, you know. My thing's been rolling.

7764
07:56:15,815 --> 07:56:20,326
That's a- I did it when I

7765
07:56:20,327 --> 07:56:24,412
was younger and then I got here and then I don't have any- I

7766
07:56:24,667 --> 07:56:26,862
got my family out here and I didn't have a lot of friends while

7767
07:56:26,863 --> 07:56:28,940
I didn't work here, so I joined the league,

7768
07:56:29,344 --> 07:56:32,131
and I saw that team, and I saw that on another team.

7769
07:56:32,132 --> 07:56:34,642
And I noticed I was having the best. Oh, there they go.

7770
07:56:34,643 --> 07:56:36,833
See, I mean, sorry about the second one here, too.

7771
07:56:36,834 --> 07:56:40,181
Uh, and then I ended up summoning the second one here.

7772
07:56:40,182 --> 07:56:42,317
Uh, both of my parents said,

7773
07:56:42,626 --> 07:56:44,736
go get the 500 horsepower car.

7774
07:56:44,789 --> 07:56:47,671
I don't care. Just don't have a motorcycle.

7775
07:56:47,672 --> 07:56:49,875
Oh, well that's, I've had a drive-in for a drive-in on a,

7776
07:56:50,222 --> 07:56:52,581
I've ridden both. I've had that certainly. Yeah,

7777
07:56:52,582 --> 07:56:54,634
I ride a little 250 on the wheel.

7778
07:56:54,635 --> 07:56:56,745
Nice. Single track. Uhh,

7779
07:56:56,755 --> 07:56:59,531
I'm a p****, so I ride an accident double track,

7780
07:56:59,541 --> 07:57:02,429
or, for a certain surroundings I'm gonna be able to single track.

7781
07:57:02,748 --> 07:57:05,450
That's not picking up. Yeah, I did single track.

7782
07:57:05,451 --> 07:57:07,973
I found one house. I'm gonna be used to the amount of time.

7783
07:57:08,547 --> 07:57:11,107
I was back when I moved to the shop. And that was a while

7784
07:57:11,108 --> 07:57:14,800
later. I don't know. And then I'll turn up Peter and I'll be able

7785
07:57:14,801 --> 07:57:17,314
to see him trying to have him in the morning. And then I'll survive.

7786
07:57:17,315 --> 07:57:21,827
And then I'll be to see him and then I'll work out on

7787
07:57:21,828 --> 07:57:24,947
the next few things in early twenties.

7788
07:57:25,745 --> 07:57:28,236
So, now it's- Thank bye.

7789
07:57:28,237 --> 07:57:30,996
Now it's over the dance floor. It's not any bowling.

7790
07:57:31,262 --> 07:57:33,435
I don't really feel the dance. I'll say it along with you.

7791
07:57:33,915 --> 07:57:36,275
I mean, I think that was the business I was just starting to- I

7792
07:57:36,413 --> 07:57:38,800
get my thirties all the way up.

7793
07:57:38,801 --> 07:57:41,053
I mean, I still have to raise bicycles for all from college.

7794
07:57:41,054 --> 07:57:43,951
I'll let you know. All right.

7795
07:57:43,952 --> 07:57:46,381
I got. And,

7796
07:57:46,382 --> 07:57:50,343
thank you for that. Yeah. Well, in, like, all I mean,

7797
07:57:50,344 --> 07:57:54,861
I guess, all I need to But when I'm holding up my

7798
07:57:55,365 --> 07:57:59,197
majority of my friends and majority of people I hold up my parents' age,

7799
07:57:59,605 --> 07:58:03,100
it's solid. Love you. I'm like, being out with a bunch of old people

7800
07:58:03,101 --> 07:58:06,454
I'm like, I've got school so I can't even have them in the habit

7801
07:58:06,455 --> 07:58:09,578
of time and then I don't blame the day. Bye. My teammates,

7802
07:58:09,949 --> 07:58:13,301
I've got a picture of my teammates in there,

7803
07:58:13,302 --> 07:58:15,630
uh, when we go to Vegas every year,

7804
07:58:15,841 --> 07:58:18,146
can. Yeah. And, uh, and they're always okay.

7805
07:58:18,186 --> 07:58:20,332
And you're so awesome. I think it's the end.

7806
07:58:20,745 --> 07:58:24,276
Okay. Look that. Look at that.

7807
07:58:24,277 --> 07:58:26,913
I think I need help. I have to connect.

7808
07:58:26,914 --> 07:58:29,679
I need some. That's my wife's. No.

7809
07:58:29,836 --> 07:58:32,251
I'm not. I'll see you.

7810
07:58:32,160 --> 07:58:35,215
You guys tomorrow. Alright, I'm gonna live on that note.

7811
07:58:35,216 --> 07:58:37,870
Uh,

7812
07:58:37,881 --> 07:58:40,296
I'm gonna talk a little bit about this field job. Bye bye.

7813
07:58:40,297 --> 07:58:40,520
Okay. Thank you.
