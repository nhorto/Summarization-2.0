Tekla PowerFab Consulting Session — Topic‑Organized Summary
Date of summary: 2025‑12‑19
(Contents reflect only explicit statements from the provided transcript.)

TOPICS AND DETAILS

1) Report Filtering, Job Orders & Job Release
- What was done:
  - The consultant filtered a report by plate size (“8th inch”) and then by guests.
  - After creating the report, the data were entered into job orders.
  - The data were assigned to a new job number that the client wanted to release rather than the original job number.
- Constraints / observations:
  - The client stated a cutter cannot be created until the part is actually cut, so the job cannot be released “until the cutter is made.”
  - The PO should already exist in the job that is pulling the data.
  - A key number will eventually be used to link the information.
- Explicit action items mentioned:
  - Report completion expected next week (client expectation).
  - Purchasing team will consolidate items across multiple jobs (see Procurement & Inventory Consolidation).

2) Estimate Folder, Drawings & Document Management
- What was reviewed:
  - The client opened the estimate folder and traced back in time to view contents and recognized the drawings inside.
  - Only the second folder was examined, not all folders.
  - A 59‑page combined file was discussed as containing the complete drawing set.
  - Specific pages called out: page 3 (standard details), page 30, and a “page 30 set” from which a “B” sheet was pulled.
  - Page 3 standard detail sheet was confirmed as the reference for standard details.
- Issues raised:
  - Drawing numbers such as “18‑6” and “NA‑T” were referenced; NA‑T are “individual drawing numbers” and the current set “doesn’t have an order.”
  - Statuspage was used to locate drawings; highlight/column display was inconsistent (“highlighted items did not always show the correct column”).
  - NCS was referenced as the location for the 59‑page file.
- Explicit action items mentioned:
  - Align each drawing sheet’s page reference with its correct drawing number (including NA‑T and 18‑6). Owner: Client/Document Control. Deadline: Next working day.
  - Create a standardized method for linking page numbers to work areas (adopt a “standard” approach). Owner: Consultant. Deadline: End of week.
  - Configure Statuspage filters so column pop‑ups display full lists instead of single lines. Owner: IT/PowerFab Admin. Deadline: Immediate.

3) Scheduling, Production Ramp‑Up & Conferences
- What was discussed:
  - The organization is ramping up to handle many small and large tasks.
  - Client intends to produce “10 to the quarter” and will provide a Jira plan describing how the work will be tackled.
  - Schedule values must be entered before running a schedule or setting up a conference.
  - A conference set‑up was offered by the consultant but was not done during the session.
  - Line‑items can be linked to schedule entries; billing will reference the linked line‑item.
  - The concept of a “historical good schedule” and viewing the schedule at the top of the screen was discussed.
- Explicit action items mentioned:
  - Populate schedule values for the New Jersey contract and schedule a conference to review the plan. Owner: Project Scheduler. Deadline: Within 3 days.
  - Prepare a Jira plan to outline approach to upcoming work (client stated).

4) Quantity Take‑Off, Estimating Figures & Category Reporting
- Explicit numeric values discussed:
  - Total material weight: 16,000 t.
  - Labor hours: 12,000 hrs.
  - Monitor cost example: $1,000,000.
  - Remainder of project example total: $2,000,000.
- Take‑off practices:
  - Emphasis on quantifying columns, braces, vertical beams, and turbines.
  - Category columns show a single line per category; full reports list all columns and associated quantities.
  - Pull down columns to generate a piece‑mark list that aggregates related parts.
  - Use of preferences/tags (e.g., Jira) suggested to streamline column selection.
- Explicit action items mentioned:
  - Generate a category summary report showing total tons (16,000 t), labor hours (12,000 hrs), and monetary values ($1 M monitor, $2 M total). Owner: Estimating Team. Deadline: End of week.
  - Document the current take‑off workflow (columns, braces, beams) and compare with recommended quick‑view method. Owner: Consultant. Deadline: Next session.

5) Tools, Interfaces & File Persistence
- Tools mentioned explicitly: Statuspage, NCS, Bitbucket, Jira, Pro‑Corps, Vista, Baseview, MediRoute, OpsGenie, Bitbucket, Photoshop (as a visualization limitation).
- Observations:
  - Statuspage was used for drawing navigation but had inconsistent display behavior.
  - Persistence: files are “all stored in the drive”; a need to “pull up the three years” of data was expressed.
  - Bitbucket base setup must be performed; creating a “city” on a tablet was mentioned; the key was changed during setup.
  - The system will not “break existing spreadsheets” and can pull material and labor into reports.
- Explicit action items:
  - Verify Bitbucket base setup and key changes are correctly applied (client requested).
  - Clarify and document the purpose of the “tool where you can make” items; identify and train users. Owner: Consultant/Tool Owner. Deadline: Within 5 days.
  - Review Jira integration to determine why it is “not producing value” (text: “there’s actually no rewarding them”).

6) Change Orders, Contract Values & Billing
- Contract and change‑order practices discussed:
  - The original contract value should be recorded and kept visible.
  - The system can display original contract value, current contract value, and change‑order totals.
  - No change orders had been approved at the time of the session: “No approved change orders to the contract.”
  - The “change button” was demonstrated to open the change‑order dialogue; the system raises warnings on improper change orders (“This one’s going to get a warning. It’s not supposed to be gone or not…”).
  - Line items tied to schedule entries appear on bills, and bills reflect the line‑item cost derived from the schedule.
- Example figures explicitly cited in transcript:
  - Proposed change‑order total: $5,000.
  - Aggregate cost example: $38,000.
  - Labor cost example: 3.03 h @ $8/h → $48 (stated).
  - Revised labor cost example: 85 h @ $100/h → $8,500 (presented as an example in transcript).
  - Additional cost line: “6,500, Rovo, 14C” ($6,500 stated).
  - Other numeric references: $6,500; $38,000; $62,000 and $62,100 were presented as two cost totals.
- Pricing, margin and target pricing:
  - Client referenced desired mark‑up of 35% and target margin of 26% on a job.
  - A market‑driven 40% increase was mentioned.
  - Cost examples explicitly listed: $6,500 (cost mentioned), $1,000 (small figure referenced).
- Explicit action items:
  - Enter original contract value in the system. (Action item described.)
  - Create & submit change orders using the “change button”; route for approval. (Action item described.)
  - Validate cost breakdowns and hourly rates in change‑order screens (e.g., $100/hr). (Action item described.)
  - Generate a preliminary report showing original contract value, total approved change orders, and projected costs for next five months. (Action item described.)

7) Estimate Configuration – Cost/Sell Fields & Mark‑up Controls
- What was stated:
  - Estimate contains separate “cost fields” and “sell fields.”
  - To modify those fields, users must return to “Base Setup” and edit definitions there.
  - Cost‑related fields appear in the lower portion of the estimate summary (“bottom colors”).
- Margin/markup specifics:
  - The client noted a 35% mark‑up vs 26% margin discrepancy.
  - A “40% increase” was referenced as market‑driven.
  - The client indicated “we can’t go below serving on your target” (target‑price control).
  - Numeric values referenced: $6,500; $38,000; $1,000; “46 down on the cost” (numeric fragment); totals 62,000 and 62,100.
- Explicit action items:
  - Return to Base Setup to edit cost and sell fields as required. (Action item stated.)
  - Verify margin calculations (35% mark‑up vs 26% margin) and adjust pricing if needed. (Action item stated.)

8) Time Studies, Stainless & Carbon Size Data
- Data quality issues:
  - Several stainless‑grade sizes in current database contained zero‑dimension values.
  - These size records were “not active.”
  - A group had recently “pushed against these undefined sizes” in the “last few days,” but no resolution had been reached.
  - Carbon‑size definition was not being populated correctly relative to seamless‑grade cloth; the carbon size was being treated the same as stainless when data were missing.
  - The client suggested separating carbon and stainless data planes to avoid mixing data.
  - Not all stakeholders had been met about this issue: “we haven’t met with all of those folks… as of yet.”
- Time‑study support:
  - Consultant offered time studies for stainless material: “I have some time studies… we can do some time studies for some stainless material.”
  - Purpose: measure contamination‑reduction activities and impact of equipment/consumables changes.
  - Client said results from time studies will feed back into labor‑code and estimating processes.
- Explicit action items:
  - Define and populate missing stainless size dimensions (zero‑dimension entries). Owner: Client (size data team). Deadline: To be completed before next estimation cycle.
  - Clarify and update carbon‑size data to ensure proper population of seamless‑grade information. Owner: Client (modeling team). Deadline: Immediate, pending data availability.
  - Conduct time‑studies on stainless material and report findings back to the estimating team. Owner: Consultant (time‑study lead). Deadline: Within the next two weeks.
  - Schedule coordination meeting with all stakeholders not yet consulted on stainless‑size issue. Owner: Consultant (project coordinator). Deadline: As soon as possible.

9) Cut, Notch, “Cut & Clean” Operations and Time Adjustments
- Operation split:
  - Team discussed separating “cut” and “clean” activities into distinct operations; cut‑time and clean‑out can be split and then flow into a single box downstream.
  - The description field that displays time will show the “cut & clean” label.
  - Consultant stated no change to existing operation is required to implement the split.
- Time metrics and percentage adjustments:
  - Baseline time quoted: 3.3 minutes for a specific task.
  - Client requested increasing time; an additional “three more minutes” was mentioned.
  - Percentage figures cited: 10% (“sound fair”), 40% (“more by 40%”), 18% (“low by 18%”), 20.5 (reference), 65% (client wanted to apply to certain column items: “I want to put them in 65%”).
  - Miscellaneous project identifier strings referenced in percentage discussion: “2‑4‑7‑5‑8”, “10‑0”, “45‑0‑6‑0”.
- Cut & notch geometry:
  - Issues: cut data missing for certain coats (“we have cuts not being here for coats”).
  - Notch dimensions and flange width handling discussed (examples: “two inches and two inches… four inches”; “scope of the width of the flange… 4‑H… it doesn’t really know how deep it’s going”).
  - Small notches were identified as common and sometimes ignored by users.
- Explicit action items:
  - Implement cut & clean split and verify operation description displays correctly.
  - Apply discussed time increases (baseline 3.3 min + additional three minutes) to the relevant operation and validate.
  - Verify cut and notch data for coat‑related components and address missing entries. Owner: Client (manufacturing data team). Deadline: Ongoing, status update at next call.
  - Review percentage impacts (10%, 18%, 40%, 65%) on identified project groups (2‑4‑7‑5‑8, 10‑0, 45‑0‑6‑0).

10) Rejection Reporting, QC, NCRs and Inspection Checklists
- Key points:
  - Discussion on how “reject” options are handled per project; “roller for the regret” was mentioned as feedback for rejected items.
  - Workflow for failed items included option to continue after failure and a preference for preventative responses vs dead ends.
  - Need to centralize inspection and rejection data into one format, one report to capture all rejections (including new projects).
  - The consultant expected to “look ahead to the rejection reports.”
  - Drop‑down menus were discussed for entering reasons and well checks; consistent naming conventions were recommended.
  - NCR numbers explicitly read: “Each NCR, so again 55 NCR is in 22, 22. We’ll one. 23, 39, 24, 41.” The team noted “No one else is seeing NCR.”
  - Video documentation and training videos were recommended to support pass/fail workflows.
- Explicit action items:
  - Develop a unified rejection report template that aggregates inspection and rejection data across projects. (Action item stated.)
  - Set up drop‑down controls for reject and well checks and make required fields mandatory. (Action item stated.)
  - Ensure NCR visibility for all stakeholders (make NCRs 55, 23, 39, 24, 41 visible). (Action item stated.)
  - Create/update video training demonstrating pass/fail workflow and data entry steps.

11) Receiving, Purchase Orders, Yard Scanning & Scheduling Cadence
- Receiving / scanning:
  - The process included “a little receiving in the yard”; all documents and parts are scanned in; receivers pull in the TRs; physical items are pulled back to the MTRs.
  - Statements: “We’ve received it. We’ve asked them to be ours.”
- Purchase orders:
  - “That’s the purchase order and we’re getting an easy number again.” The “easy number” was referenced multiple times in connection with internal development and purchase.
  - Discussion of new purchase markets and new channels.
- Order cadence:
  - Orders are on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week.
  - A desire to “follow us in front of it” and track receipts was expressed.
- Explicit action items:
  - Confirm PO number consistency across new purchase markets. (Action item stated.)
  - Validate receipt tracking and visibility for Tuesday/Thursday orders. (Action item stated.)
