LABOR MANAGEMENT / ESTIMATING
- Labor codes and workflow: Emphasis on labor codes described as “six in one,” and the process of bringing an estimate into production with labor exported via time-tracking workflows tied to those labor codes.
- Time-tracking exports: Hours and employee numbers are exported from time-tracking into Excel (Vista) with a workflow that includes project-specific phase codes, so data can be filtered and cascaded into the receiving system.
- Direct vs indirect labor: Current process includes a direct vs indirect labor distinction, with discussion of how indirect labor applies to projects (e.g., codes like 1200); hours are allocated accordingly.
- Daily labor reporting: A daily labor report was described as an automated recap sent from a daily meeting, summarizing hours used and trends (e.g., increases or negative trends) to help pre-empt issues.
- PAM (project management) reporting cadence: Mention of a PAM report that can aggregate across projects; daily/weekly cadence described as part of labor and production governance (weekly sheet reviewed on Fridays).
- Estimator rate limit concern: A concern was raised about the estimator’s rate limit being vastly different from expectations and whether adjustments or alternatives should be considered; discussions included adjusting percentages (e.g., 75%) and how defaults (e.g., 98%) interact with user expectations.
- Default vs. future discussions: The default estimation behavior and subsequent adjustments were noted as items for future stakeholder discussions to align numbers with reality.

 NEXT STEPS / ACTION ITEMS (explicit)
- The transcript indicates ongoing discussions on estmate/rate limits and default percentages to align with expectations; explicit next steps to finalize those discussions are implied but not enumerated in a single line per this topic.

MATERIALS / PURCHASING (NESTING / WIRE)
- Wire data planning: Plan to add wire sizes and gauges and keep those measurements in the same linear metric as round bar (consistent units).
- Wire purchasing quantities: Discussion of how much wire is actually purchased (e.g., by length) and spool quantities; Stephen and Michael can buy up to 3,000-foot spools, with the final decision dependent on actual use.
- Five minute strut: Brief topic area to be addressed, implying considerations about materials and stocking in relation to ordering/stocking.

 NEXT STEPS / ACTION ITEMS (explicit)
