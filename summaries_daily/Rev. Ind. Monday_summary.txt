  - The K value in text exports may be unused; potential workaround is to remove the K value from the export if not used.
  - Differences between SSPL and existing data (e.g., carbon vs stainless) require careful versioning and possibly a bulk update approach rather than item-by-item changes.
  - Weight data may vary by grade and supplier; density references (stainless ~0.31, carbon ~0.289 pounds per cubic inch) were discussed as inputs for conversions.
- Configurations / changes implemented
  - Planned text-file changes (SSL to SSA) and importing with SSL/SSA selection; explored bulk replacement, and discussed potential data-conversion workflows.
- Decisions / recommendations
  - Use a version-rate approach to apply SSPL changes efficiently; verify SSPL inclusion before bulk replacement; determine whether to standardize on a single weight metric and how to propagate changes across modules.
- Next steps
  - Complete SSPL inclusion checks; finalize the text-file mapping Pl. to SSPL; test SSA imports; implement the version-rate approach; monitor for conversion anomalies; coordinate with purchasing to manage procurement implications.

ESTIMATING (STAINLESS CONVERSION / WEIGHT CALCULATIONS)
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Stainless conversion planning, starting from a baseline size and testing additional sizes to establish non-linear factors; density references for stainless and carbon; use of AI-assisted calculations (ChatGPT) as an aid.
- Key findings / observations
  - Stainless conversion is non-linear; multiple size tests are needed to form a defensible ballpark; density values are critical inputs (stainless ~0.31, carbon ~0.289 lb/in3).
  - AI-assisted calculations can help but baselines must be preserved; a measured base size is recommended before expanding tests.
  - Weight variability exists by grade and supplier; conversions must account for non-uniform factors.
- Configurations / changes implemented
  - Agreed to begin with one baseline size and extend tests to other sizes; plan to apply non-linear factors and document each tested size’s factor.
- Decisions / recommendations
  - Use density values as ground truth for weight conversions; avoid locking in a single linear factor; maintain a living library of conversion factors by size.
- Next steps
  - Execute baseline size test, add 1–2 more sizes for non-linear factor development, document results, and refine conversion factors iteratively.

MATERIALS / WEIGHT MANAGEMENT / PRODUCTION IMPACT
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Weight-driven estimation considerations; variability in weight by material supplier/grade; strategies to set weights (keep as-is, zero, or high-side approach).
  - Impacts on PO values, invoicing, and procurement when weight data changes; potential temporary PO changes during SSPL updates.
- Key findings / observations
  - Weight data changes propagate across production, inventory, and payables; inconsistent weight values can cause data integrity issues.
  - Some shops may rely on high-side weight values to stabilize estimates during transitions; weight changes should be carefully versioned.
- Configurations / changes implemented
  - Planned a bulk-weight update approach (version-based) to minimize item-by-item edits.
- Decisions / recommendations
  - Decide whether to set weights to zero or to a high value; establish a version-rate approach; coordinate with purchasing and finance for temporary impacts.
- Next steps
  - Validate the chosen weight strategy; implement bulk SSPL weight changes with proper versioning; communicate procurement implications to stakeholders.

ESTIMATING
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Employment of macro-level adjustments, weight-based extrapolations, and data consolidation across sizes; discussion of density-based inputs for weight calculations.
- Key findings / observations
  - Time studies and weight/size properties drive extrapolation; cross-sectional properties determine labor-time contributions; updating sizes may require recalibration of times.
- Configurations / changes implemented
  - Initiated data consolidation efforts, global edits, and extrapolation adjustments; planned to propagate updates via bulk conversions.
- Decisions / recommendations
  - Maintain non-linear conversion logic; ensure data completeness for each size; verify that weights propagate to estimating and labor standards accurately.
