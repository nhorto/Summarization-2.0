Tekla PowerFab Consulting — Topic‑Organized Session Summary
(Prepared from the single‑day transcript; no external information added)

Consultant on call: Ricky Horton

Notes:
- All content below is drawn verbatim or directly from the transcript. No assumptions or additions have been made.
- Completed actions are written in past tense; current states and persistent configurations are written in present tense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Meeting scheduling & calendar coordination
- Discussed setting a target date for an onsite visit. Tuesday was identified as a possible day; a Wednesday slot was also referenced.
- Action recorded in transcript: Ricky was to send a calendar invitation to the client (Jimmy) so the meeting appears on his calendar and he can attend at the agreed time.
- Owner / target per transcript: Ricky / before next business day (explicit in one of the follow‑up tables).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Work‑package visibility & Gantt chart integration
- Client observed that work packages were not visible on the current schedule view.
- Ricky confirmed work packages were required and would be used to populate a Gantt‑chart system for tracking next steps.
- No work‑package items were observed on the schedule at the time of the call.
- Next steps specified in transcript:
  - Review the schedule to ensure work packages are displayed.
  - Configure the Gantt‑chart module to pull data from the work‑package list.
- Owner per transcript: Ricky / immediate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Invoicing status
- Client asked: “Did you invoice us yet?”
- Ricky stated invoicing would be delayed until after he leaves and reassured the client there were “no concerns” at this time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Reporting tools, data extraction, and automation
- Demonstrated report that lists all items and properties (size, shape, cross‑sectional area, flange widths, etc.). Navigation shown:
  - Top‑Ships → Great Size → Maintenance drop‑down → Reports → Make Report.
- Report behavior:
  - Report does not show exceptions; it displays every component so users can scan for missing properties (cross‑sectional areas, flange widths, etc.).
  - A “size list” report was mentioned that lists all components.
- Suggested automation:
  - Schedule the report to run once per month and email results to a designated recipient (proposed as monthly automation).
  - Owner per transcript: Ricky / within two weeks (for establishing monthly scheduling).
- Export instructions (later recurring guidance in transcript):
  - From an SM plan: click plan → Estimating drop‑down → View Labor Details → right‑click → Dump to Excel.
  - This was the explicit path shown to export labor detail for summation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Trimble Connect integration and Structures 2025 detailer workflow
- Current detailing workflow uses Structures 2025.
- Starting in 2025, users can share grades, shapes, and finishes with detailers via a Trimble Connect project (termed “the bridge between the two packages”):
  - Client uploads data to a Trimble Connect project.
  - Detailer links their model to the same Trimble Connect project, creating a bridge between the software packages.
  - When a shape/grade is unrecognized in the receiving system, an import pop‑up alerts the user (“I don’t recognize this shape or grade”).
  - If a detailer chooses a different grade than stored, the import is flagged; the user must change it before proceeding. The system lists all items that are wrong.
- A “slight amount of set‑up” was stated to be required on the client side to enable the pop‑up/flagging screen; enabling the import‑screen pop‑up was explicitly mentioned.
- Sharing options in the upper‑right “info sharing” drop‑down include: Shapes; Grades & sizes; Finishes; ABM (Advanced Bill of Materials) settings.
- ABM section was described as revamped; users can define parameters and notify the detailer when a change falls outside defined parameters.
- Owner / next step per transcript: Client (detailers) + Ricky / prior to next detailing cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Connector (automatic submittal retrieval) and package import/reject workflow
- A Connector feature pulls files directly into the client’s environment without email; files appear in a list view.
- Connector behavior:
  - Files appear automatically in a list.
  - Connector delivers submittals linked to imported files.
  - The user can import a package directly from the connector list.
  - If a package lacks drawings or required data, the user can reject it; rejection creates a log entry in “Tech Structures” noting the reason (e.g., “no draws”).
  - Videos demonstrating the connector operation are available and were offered.
- Consultant recommendation (explicit): Deploy the Connector and test import/reject workflow — Owner: Client (validate files appear without email); Consultant to provide video resources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Permissions, grade/shape creation controls, and grade usage rules
- Issues identified:
  - Duplicate grades being created.
  - Grades being added to the “carving” instead of the intended stainless call‑out.
  - Five‑plus users historically had permission to create grades; permissions were tightened.
- Permissions change:
  - Creating grades was moved to a “special” permission type (explicitly mentioned).
- Grade/shape rules (explicit):
  - Adding grades or sizes is easy (one‑at‑a‑time) on the imports screen; this ease can lead to unintended additions if users are not knowledgeable.
  - Grades are unique to each shape: adding a grade to Channels does not make it available for Beams or Angles automatically; it must be added to each shape individually.
- Process demonstrated for assigning a grade:
  1. Assign the new grade (example: 836) — it appears at the top of the list.
  2. Manually remove the grade from the abbreviation field where it is not needed.
- Most standard sizes were stated as already present; adding a grade applies to all sizes within that specific call‑out only.
- Action per transcript: Grade cleanup (review existing grades for duplicates and remove unwanted entries from abbreviations) — Owner: Client team / ongoing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) ASCII export/import workflow for angles and SSL/SSA conversion
- Steps demonstrated (explicit transcript instructions):
  1. Export shape data: Export → Export to ASCII.
  2. Open the exported text file; make controlled find‑and‑replace edits.
     - Example: find “L” and replace with “SSL” or vice versa, but caution: do not blindly replace every occurrence of “L” (some are comments).
     - The consultant instructed to navigate to “shapes included” line before applying replacements.
  3. Save and close the edited ASCII file.
  4. Import the edited file back into Tekla.
- Specific use case: change grade designation from “L” to “SSL” (or SSL to SSA). Ricky cautioned about replacing every “L” and noted comments in the file that are harmless.
- Shape Maintenance follow‑up:
  - Use Shape Maintenance drop‑down to verify and adjust new SSL grade.
  - View dimension grade usage via “shape grade size maintenance.”
- Recommendation in transcript when historical purchase/inventory must be preserved:
  - Rename the existing grade (e.g., to “SSA” or “SSA old”) and create a new SSL grade so purchase history is preserved; this avoids losing cost/purchase records.
- K‑value behavior:
  - The K‑value may be present in angle definitions but is informational and not used in default calculations; the consultant suggested removing the K‑value from the text file as the easiest fix because K is not transferred by import.
- Owner / next step per transcript: Client (Mark/Gavin/Alan) to perform ASCII export/edit/import; Ricky offered to export cleaned files and email them to the client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Gate‑distance correction via Excel / CSV workflow
- To remove a gate distance value of 0.25 globally:
  - Export the line‑item list as a CSV/text file (column separators).
  - Zero‑out the gate‑distance column in Excel.
  - Save the edited file in CSV format (ensure extension accepted by import routine).
  - Rename the file appropriately before import to preserve original as a backup.
- Ricky confirmed deleting the .25 globally was safe because that value only occurred in the current document.
- Owner per transcript: Client to perform export, edit, and re‑import.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) ChatGPT used for text‑file cleaning
- The consultant used ChatGPT (paid version referenced elsewhere in transcript) to clean an angle CSV that contained formatting issues preventing import.
- After ChatGPT cleanup, the file imported and populated weight and cross‑sectional area attributes correctly.
- Ricky offered to email the cleaned file to the client for validation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Service pack, performance, and hardware variability
- Observed issue: an application lag (“there was a lag… it would come up with that then check on not responding”).
- Cause and resolution: a recently released service pack caused the lag; the vendor fixed it (explicit in transcript).
- Performance variability was attributed more to shop hardware than software settings: some shops are “mega slow,” others “super fast.”
- Network considerations and server location:
  - Discussions of Wi‑Fi, 5G (described as “pretty slow” in one test), shared vs. dedicated connections, and server mirroring; a Mexico server location was mentioned.
- Action per transcript: Monitor post‑update lag/performance issues and report to vendor if persisted — Owner: Client / ongoing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) Stainless‑steel conversion, densities, weight values, and Global Edit usage
- Explicit density / weight figures and conversion details stated in transcript:
  - Stainless density used in design software: 0.31 (unit in transcript: “.31”).
  - Harmony density: 0.28 (explicit).
  - Type 304 stainless weight referenced as ≈495 lb/ft³ (Ricky’s recollection).
  - Quarter‑inch plate weights (explicit mentions):
    - Stainless quarter‑inch plate: 11.6 lb/ft² (“11.6 lbs per square foot”).
    - Carbon quarter‑inch plate: 10.2 lb/ft² (implied when the consultant compared carbon vs stainless; the transcript stated “10.2 lb/ft² (implied)”—the 10.2 value was present in transcript context).
  - Multiple inconsistent figures were spoken for tube weights (examples: 8.953, 9.9336, 8.81) — all were captured exactly in the transcript.
- Global Edit workflow described (explicit steps):
  1. Pull a carbon‑steel plate (PL) entry that has time data into the editing dialog.
  2. Use Global Edit to copy the definition to the stainless‑steel plate family (SSPL).
  3. Confirm the operation (OK); “Now it’s updating it.”
- Behavior noted:
  - System will not automatically convert weight unless the user requests it (“it’s not doing the conversion unless you want it to”).
  - There is a tool to “take the whole database of the card and say convert this and it will convert it for you,” but the client indicated “that won’t do that one” (explicit limitation).
  - After Global Edit, stainless‑plate entries contained times derived from carbon‑plate data modified by the chosen extrapolation factor.
- Explicit examples and observations:
  - When testing density in Global Edit, a part weight changed “from 1.9 to 5 … because of the 490 lbs per cubic foot” example was shown.
  - The consultant tested a target weight of 0.651 for a 1×1×1/8 element (the transcript included “should calculate to 0.651”).
- Action items per transcript:
  - Verify current SSPL weight values (stainless vs carbon) — Owner: Client / immediate.
  - Export current plate size data and perform bulk convert (Pl. → SSPL) using Global Editor — Owner: Consultant / after verification.
  - Conduct a sandbox test to observe impact on PAS, inventory, and PO before production rollout — Owner: Consultant & Client IT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Extrapolation factors and labor standards for stainless
- Extrapolation factors were described as multipliers that make time grow or shrink; possible bases include cross‑sectional area, length, weight, or any user‑defined attribute.
- Examples discussed:
  - If an operation is driven by length, the standard length is used to make the time grow or shrink accordingly.
  - The factor ensures different thicknesses receive different times (e.g., 1‑inch vs 1/8‑inch plates).
- Practical process for stainless plates:
  1. Select a carbon‑steel plate with times.
  2. Global Edit → Send to SSPL.
  3. Confirm and let the system populate times for stainless based on the extrapolation factor.
- Owner / next step: Establish extrapolation factor consistent with client’s chosen base (area, weight or length) — Owner: Consultant & Client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) Populating sizes for estimating and maintenance navigation
- Observations:
  - New channel sizes added do not automatically appear in estimating; user must manually add them in Maintenance → Estimating.
  - In Maintenance/Estimating tab, users can click Add at the bottom to bring new channel sizes from the Shapr‑E size database into the estimating list.
  - Notification occurs showing added time values (example: “1.66 minutes” observed for a channel cut).
- Default times:
  - Times displayed for cuts (e.g., 1.66 minutes) are default Tekla/PowerFab times; shops maintain their own table of operation times (e.g., “Lone Row” may have customized times).
- Location of formulas:
  - Mathematical formulas that convert properties into cut‑time reside in Maintenance → Estimating and also in the Labor Standards area at the bottom of the interface.
- Action per transcript:
  - Add new channel sizes manually through Maintenance → Estimating to ensure cut‑time values appear — Owner: Client / immediate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15) Default labor times in client database and example PX edits
- Transcript quoted out‑of‑the‑box/default times and changes:
  - Unload (handling): 12 min (default).
  - Move (general): 12 min and another reference to 18 min (multiple references in transcript).
  - Cut time had been changed to 6 min (explicit).
  - A demonstrated change increased unload time by 10% from 12 → 13.2 min.
  - Load time example: increase from 14 → 16 min (explicit in transcript).
  - Move time example: increase from 18 → 19.8 min (explicit).
- Procedure demonstrated for PX edits:
  1. Open Labor Standards → select the PX (e.g., PX18) on the right‑hand labor standards panel.
  2. Edit the time value (e.g., unload from 12 to 13.2).
  3. Use “Pull over” to propagate the edited value to selected operations while excluding unrelated columns (e.g., W1240).
- Consultant recommendation (explicit):
  - To react to shop performance quickly, adjust weld times and re‑run the estimate (Ricky: “is what I do a lot”).
- Action items per transcript:
  - Perform a labor‑code audit and update times where defaults remain — Owner: Client (with consultant support).
  - Apply example 10% handling adjustments as a test — Owner: Consultant (demo) / Client to re‑run estimates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16) Handling, “Get Piece” logic, and equipment‑specific handling
- “Get Piece” / Move operation:
  - The “Get Piece” entry represents movement within the shop (yard to machine, cut, etc.). It can be customized and will carry lessons forward.
- The system’s current handling extrapolation was described as length‑driven in many cases; the client stated they “care more about weight” in some use cases.
- Equipment impact:
  - Example: ACPC vs saw — straight cuts are more efficient on the saw; ACPC may have drastically different handling.
  - Unique handling times can be attached to specific operations if required.
- Practical adjustments:
  - For heavy projects the client said handling categories (move, load/unload, handling) were changed weekly, and the question was raised whether all three should be changed together; transcript recorded client practice to change them as a group when needed.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Document average handling times for saw vs ACPC and adjust parameters accordingly — Owner: Client Estimators / Consultant to follow up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17) Spot checks, time studies, and data collection strategy
- Goal stated: perform “a lot of spot checks and time studies on certain projects” and obtain a distinct data set for each setup, then make adjustments.
- Complexity noted: many shapes may each have 20 different dimensions (or “hundreds”), making the effort intense.
- Sampling approach described: sample representative items (e.g., 1st, 5th, 15th shape) to see correlation and extrapolate.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Plan and execute spot checks/time studies to build a data set and refine estimating values — Owner: Client & Consultant / ongoing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) HSS / Tube handling, size thresholds, and fabrication workarounds
- HSS/Tubes observations:
  - The client had turned off or not activated HSS in their environment in some contexts.
  - A configuration can automatically convert TS objects to HSS during take‑off (consultant said “would be a good idea”).
  - The team discussed a practical limit: the largest common stainless tube encountered was 8×8 in; for tubes beyond practical sizes, plate‑weld construction would be used.
  - Client hard limit on cutting: “I can’t cut anything over 2030.” (No unit provided; statement included as explicit transcript text).
- Size list notes:
  - HSSR list contained sizes such as 1.9 in (1½ in reference). No exact 2 in entry; some sizes appeared inconsistent (5 in example).
- Action items per transcript:
  - Implement a flagging mechanism to alert when tube exceeds defined size threshold (e.g., >2 in) — Ricky committed to “find a way to do that.”
  - Validate HSS library activation and ensure expected HSS shapes exist — Owner: Client / immediate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19) Hole‑count extrapolation issue for tubes and HSS
- Root cause identified for tubes receiving zero time: extrapolation factor was tied to “number of holes in a standard clip”; for the reviewed tubes the clip‑hole count was zero, causing zero time to be allocated (“That’s why we got no time”).
- Consultant recommended:
  - Change extrapolation/stripolation factors to be based on actual holes in the clip.
  - Edit HSS tube entries to reflect correct hole counts and standard clip of two (explicitly: “every single tube has holes and standard clip of two”).
  - Repass the plan so corrected values populate HSS.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Edit HSS file to replace zero‑hole entries, set standard clip to two, repass take‑off — Owner: Client & Consultant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20) QC (quality‑control) time, flags, and schedule visibility
- QC time was not estimated by default on the schedule; QC entries in schedule were zero unless applied when a material check was required.
- Transcript specifics:
  - Client expected approximately 5 hours of QC time; they observed QC utilization of almost 30 hours in one instance and reported totals reaching ≈140 hours when QC is included.
  - Workflow: QC checks were flagged; the flag is dropped once the short (≈5 minute) QC check is performed.
- Concern: missing QC hours in schedule cause discrepancies between estimated and actual hours; client expressed the need to add QC as an “extra” item for reconciliation.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Gather and consolidate QC‑related hour data and add to totals — Owner: Client team / end of week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21) Mobile devices, tablets, and drawing distribution
- Tablet usage:
  - 9‑inch tablets used in shops; larger 28‑inch touch displays used by QC staff.
  - Drawing revisions update instantly on tablets when revision is imported.
  - Rolling chargers and refrigerated storage were used to keep devices functional in extreme heat; a freezer was purchased for shipping/receiving.
- Adoption stats cited:
  - ~80% adopt tablets immediately; 10‑15% adopt after a few weeks; ~5% never adopt.
- Recommendation (explicit): provide a mix of device sizes — larger touch screens for QC and smaller tablets for field staff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22) Robotic welding, vision systems, and high‑volume automation
- Robotic welding was described as feasible for simple repetitive parts; vision systems (Lincoln) improved detection vs earlier versions (AVV).
- Robot workflow:
  - Robot pulls geometry directly from the model, loads into database, and executes welds autonomously.
  - For simple parts robot can perform 100% welds; for complex structural parts human finish is required.
- Implementation note: Successful robotic programs require persistent operational effort; many shops buy equipment but do not invest in making it work.
- Transcript: consultant praised robotic performance and cited examples of very high production during competitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23) Connector/Trimble and communication/audit trail benefits
- Using the Connector and Trimble Connect sharing increases clarity between the client and detailers:
  - Flags mismatches in grade/shape.
  - Rejections create entries with reasons in Tech Structures, providing an audit trail.
- Consultant emphasized this made communication smoother and provided clearer issue resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24) Export / Vista ERP / PO workflow and procurement notes (explicit)
- Tekla↔Vista data exchange was described as export driven; Vista is the origin point for job numbers and POs in their workflow.
- Specifics:
  - Job number comes from Vista; Tekla estimate cannot be loaded into the database until a Vista job number exists.
  - PO generation was Vista‑centric; the PO had to be entered in Tekla to match Vista’s PO numbering (a manual duplicate entry was confirmed in transcript: “You’re doing it twice…that sucks.”).
  - PO numbering was reconfigured to match Vista’s new six‑digit scheme (e.g., “400,000”); historical 3‑4 digit PO numbers changed.
  - Some items exported from Tekla to Vista and vice versa; however, most workflows relied on file exports rather than live integration.
- Risks / pain points explicitly stated:
  - Lack of real‑time integration between systems (“program’s not talking to each other”).
  - Manual duplicate PO entry and potential for transcription errors.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Validate export integrity and confirm PO synchronization procedure — Owner: Client & Consultant.
  - Document job creation sequence (job in Vista then set up project in Tekla) — Owner: Consultant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25) Procurement & vendor management observations (explicit)
- Organizational procurement:
  - There was no dedicated procurement programmer; a single warehouse contact handled procurement funneling.
  - Consolidation to one purchaser was discussed to achieve better pricing and reduce duplicated small purchases.
- Vendor comments:
  - Relationship notes (Ryerson, Brown Steel acquisition by Delta) and negotiation stance were recorded.
- Action per transcript:
  - Consider consolidating purchasing under a single point of contact — Owner: client leadership / ongoing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26) Post‑mortem processes, project close‑out and estimator vs shop feedback
- The team conducts project close‑outs to compare actual labor vs estimate; however, database refresh with actual performance had not been consistently completed.
- Consultant recommended:
  - Estimators should spend time in the shop/field (explicit suggestion: “spend an hour or two in the shop… three weeks an hour or two in the field”) to better understand real production times.
  - Establish trust‑and‑verify review for overruns and feed results back to database.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Reconcile estimates with actuals and update labor standards (post‑mortem) — Owner: Client & Consultant / ongoing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27) Labor‑coding, work packages and scheduling issues
- Observations:
  - Work packages were being used but not always reflected in schedule or resource planning.
  - Scheduling lacked hooks to propagate labor overruns through schedule; new hires without experience caused tasks to take longer and labor hours were not updated.
  - A master schedule approach is in use where the current week is locked and subsequent weeks are flexible (explicit in transcript).
- Recommendations recorded in transcript:
  - Establish pre‑construction client meetings to align scope and resource allocation.
  - Reserve slots in the master schedule for under‑released work packages to avoid ad‑hoc insertions.
- Action items per transcript:
  - Improve contractor/scheduler communication and integrate work packages into Gantt chart (Ricky / immediate).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29) Explicit numeric and technical facts captured verbatim (selected)
- Densities / weights / conversion values:
  - Stainless density used in design software: 0.31 (explicit).
  - Harmony density: 0.28 (explicit).
  - Type 304 stainless ≈ 495 lb/ft³ (Ricky’s statement).
  - Quarter‑inch stainless plate: 11.6 lb/ft² (explicit).
  - Quarter‑inch carbon plate: 10.2 lb/ft² (implied in transcript).
- Estimating/default times:
  - Channel cut example: 1.66 minutes (demonstrated).
  - Default unload (handling): 12 min (transcript).
  - Default move: 12 min and another reference to 18 min.
  - Cut time modified to 6 min (explicit).

- Conversion / sample tube weights quoted in transcript: 8.953, 9.9336, 8.81 (all quoted as spoken; inconsistent numbers preserved).
- Limitation: “I can’t cut anything over 2030.” (quoted exactly as in transcript; no unit stated).
- Largest commonly used stainless tube observed: 8×8 in (explicit).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30) Concerns, risks, and limitations identified explicitly in transcript
- Duplicate grades and unintended additions from import screens pose risk to data integrity.
- ASTM ↔ ASME auto‑linking for specs (e.g., grade 836) was noted to be minor but potentially affecting downstream reporting and validation.
- Bulk conversion tools may not handle every case automatically (“that won’t do that one”).
- Missing cross‑sectional area or flange width results in no cut time or zero coating calculations (explicit).
- Lack of automation between Tekla and Vista results in duplicate manual PO entries and potential mismatch errors.
- QC time not included in estimates/schedules unless manually applied leads to under‑reported hours.
- Hardware/network variability and server/location concerns can cause application lag and slow performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31) Explicit training, documentation, and process aids mentioned
- Consultant suggested creating short videos / possibly a YouTube channel to answer recurring client questions (“Might as well make a YouTube channel and send it up there”).
- Ricky offered to provide videos demonstrating Connector usage.

End of transcript‑derived summary.
If you want, I can produce:
- A prioritized action list drawn only from the explicit action items above;
- A condensed one‑page checklist for the next onsite visit (calendar invite, files to bring, sandbox tests to run);
- Or export the explicit step sequences for ASCII export/import and for labor PX edits as runnable checklists.
