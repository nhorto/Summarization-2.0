Welding codes, weld handling, and “stand‑by time”
- Explicit statements:
  - The transcript referenced “Thunder, Target Welding Special Code” and the desire to “use on these jobs.”  
  - The client said: “So we can say, OK, standby time or whatever you want to call it like this.”  
  - “There’s a labor code for the welding code… built into it as well.”  
  - “It does double the welding here.” / “you need to change that forward and tune on that one.”  
  - “Full pin prep … both ends of a beam … front face only now.”  
- Observations recorded in transcript:
  - The client expressed interest in applying the “Thunder, Target Welding Special Code” and in defining a “stand‑by time” field, but no numeric values or exact configuration steps for the stand‑by time were provided.
- Explicit next steps / action items (stated or implied in transcript):
  - “Clarify the exact definition and required configuration of the ‘stand‑by time’ field within the welding code settings.” (as explicitly stated)

  - Trello / “We’ll in the next and instead of beginning to hear about Trello so far…”
  - Atlassian / “While Atlassian seems to want stuff for a look at it, shouldn’t it?”
  - MediRoute / “MediRoute. Check our open up is four o’clock.” / MediRoute referenced in several contexts
  - OpsGenie, Statuspage, Bitbucket, Confluence (multiple transcript locations)
- Observations:
  - The client referenced multiple collaboration platforms but did not describe specific integrations with Tekla PowerFab in detail.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Determine the client’s preferred workflow tool and document how Tekla models, reports, and change‑orders will be linked to that system.”  
  - “Verify Bitbucket repository access and expected deliverables (e.g., model files, scripts).” (both items were explicitly recorded)

---

Production capacity, throughput targets, and scheduling
- Explicit numeric targets stated:
  - “You need to do 93 tons a day.”  
  - “It’s like 81‑0 day.” (phrasing in transcript: 81 days also referenced elsewhere)  
  - We also recorded “71 days,” “81 days,” and multiple references to “12 January” deadlines and “15‑day window” in different sections of the transcript.
- Scheduling and planner statements:
  - “you can go in here, reschedule. Push this Go on a day if you needed to. Push it through Monday.”  
  - “Typically we’ll set during our kickoff, we schedule the current date that goes as expected by the bill poll winner.”  
  - Production planner and Production Scale views were demonstrated (weekly capacity, burn table ~20 h per week in an example).
- Observations:
  - Multiple production targets were quoted without project context in the transcript (93 t/day; “81‑0 day”; “71 days”).
- Explicit action items:
  - “Request clarification on the scope (project name, equipment, schedule) that drives the 93 t/d goal.”

  - “There is a security hub.” / “M***********.” (redacted)
  - “a directory is not set up correctly… a law practically… for a directory not being set up correctly”
  - “global fault directories… on the C‑drive of the server; the fault directories were basically stop… on the server.”
  - “I can give you some runtime if anything.” (offer of runtime files)
- Observations / concerns:
  - The transcript identified server mapping issues: server expected paths (R: drive) vs actual (C: drive / Mac share), and a need to update to UNC paths; the transcript recorded this as a problem requiring a fix.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Verify client security requirements for model data, especially when using cloud‑based repositories (Bitbucket, Atlassian).”  
  - “Verify and correct the global fault directory configuration on the server C‑drive.” (both items were explicitly recorded)

---

HoloLens visual verification & QC process
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - “HoloLens‑based visual check overlaying the BIM model onto the fabricated assembly.”  
  - Accuracy of the overlay was described as “within 1⁄16 in” (also elsewhere as “60th of an inch” depending on transcript wording). The transcript explicitly stated “within 1⁄16 in” in one section.
  - “Reference magnets are placed at known points; the headset ‘picks up’ these markers to align the virtual model.”  
  - “A single‑beam inspection of an ‘intricate beam’ takes about five minutes to complete.”  
  - “QC card (performing card) is used by QC personnel for this QA activity.”  
  - Microsoft discontinued HoloLens hardware; alternatives mentioned: Meta, Apple; license cost of $2,500 referenced for HoloLens capability.
  - “Sunlight interferes with the AR overlay (‘one of these the sun is in your way’).”
- Observations:

- Explicit next steps:
  - “Standardize the placement of magnetic markers on all critical components and capture a step‑by‑step SOP for the 5‑minute HoloLens verification.” (explicit in transcript)

---

Tablet (EPM Go / FabStation) UI, Start/Stop/Update flow and device provisioning
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - Demonstrated EPM / tablet sign‑in → ID + passcode required: “Users sign with their ID and are prompted for a passcode before proceeding.”  
  - “Start → Stop → Update” flow for blasting/painting (Start records start, Stop ends activity, Update registers quantity) and “Update calculates a consolidated quantity from line‑by‑line entries.”  
  - The tablet shows item lines (e.g., “two of this, four of that…”) editable line‑by‑line before Update.  
  - Tablet deployment: “we have 17 tablets or something to go there” / “large charging station available.”  
  - Tablets were described as iPad‑type devices, in Otterbox‑style cases, stylus support, cases replaced every ~6 months.  
  - Login and app UI examples showed painting/blasting workflow and production‑status updates (Prep, Prime, Intermediate, Finished codes).  
  - “Start” button activation question: whether to press Start at pallet receipt or after staging on horses — an open decision to be clarified with stakeholder “Mo.”  
  - “Operators will be assigned specific tablets; encoding (user‑to‑device mapping) is configured.”
- Observations:
  - The tablet interface was demonstrated repeatedly; Start/Stop/Update is core to the client’s shop workflows (blasting, painting, production tracing).
- Explicit next steps / actions:
  - “Verify that all tablet devices are correctly encoded and that any hardware issues (drive failures) are resolved.”  
  - “Prepare a short training session for operators on the Start‑Stop‑Update workflow using the tablet UI.”  
  - “Confirm ‘Start’ button trigger point with Mo (pallet vs soft horse).” (all explicitly recorded)

---

Work packages, piece‑tracking, routes and station logic
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - “Work package aggregates assemblies, drawings, and associated data.”  
  - Piece‑tracking is critical: “piece‑tracking allows users to track each component throughout the project.”  
  - Work‑package view allows generation of shipping lists, Word‑type packages, and other documentation.  
  - Route creation and station additions were demonstrated; a route ties to piece‑tracking enabling station progress tracking.  
  - Two tracking modes discussed: hierarchical versus individual tracking; example: a single work package across full scope vs separate tracking by category.  
  - “If the last station is complete then that’s all.” / last station completion logic was demonstrated.
  - “Start button should be triggered at a consistent point” — open question for operator practice.
- Observations:
  - Some projects had no inspections tied; other projects were configured with piece‑tracking.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Add piece‑tracking to the project that currently lacks it.” (explicit)  
  - “Prepare demo of hierarchical vs individual work‑package tracking and capture client feedback.” (explicit)

---

Inspection module, reports and test status
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - “Inspections module currently in beta; attempting to open redirected to home screen with note feature still in beta.”  
  - Demonstrated the General Inspection screen: choose inspection type, location, assign inspector, free‑form Notes, attach picture for failed item, Submit links record to job number.
  - “Only one inspection test had been performed so far in the demo environment.”  
  - Reports can be generated to break down inspections by project.
- Observations:
  - No inspections have been set up for the current project at time of session.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Configure the Inspection module for the current project once the beta version is released.” (explicit)
  - “Test linking inspection records to job numbers and run reporting.” (explicit)

---

Integration with third‑party tools, repositories and exports
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - Repeated references to integration points: Bitbucket, Jira, Trello, Atlassian, Loom, Bitbucket repository access, Procore (Pro 4), Vista, Salesforce, Trimble Connect, IFC, KISS file import/export.
  - “Progress integration / optimization… spits out the file” (described by client).
  - “You’ll generate a file and you’ll shoot that into my phone right now” (file generation and transfer phrasing).
  - “We moved BO list into SEVA” and SEVA breakdown for steel purchases (explicit).
  - IFC and PDF export options were demonstrated: “IFC export for downstream BIM; PDF export includes quantity take‑offs, material sizes, labor codes, camber/coat data.”
- Observations:
  - Multiple systems are in use; client keeps Procore because Tekla integration points are not fully covering data‑transfer needs.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Determine the client’s preferred workflow tool and document how Tekla models, reports, and change‑orders will be linked to that system.” (explicit)
  - “Follow up with development team for clarifications on part‑orientation handling and section support for auto‑recognition.” (explicitly mentioned in transcript)

---

Model import / building‑scanner demo, auto‑recognition and cleanup
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - Demo of “building scanner” that uploads PDFs and auto‑recognizes structural elements (columns, beams, studs) and generates a pre‑populated model.
  - Auto‑recognition correctly picked up top‑of‑steel scale values and W10×12 beams (including six studs).
  - Manual cleanup demonstrated: selecting mis‑identified items and marking them “don’t process” / delete unwanted geometry before finalizing model.
  - Configuration page controls deep‑connection options, seismic settings, default member types; these are saved per project.
  - Column schedules and splice insertion options (welded/bolted) were shown; bracing definition and automatic placement (HSS with weld) were demonstrated.
  - Export pathways: IFC and PDF. BOM / Take‑off fields included quality, shape, size, length, grade, camber, coat, studs.
- Observations:
  - The engine sometimes mis‑identified objects and required manual selection and re‑build cycles.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Client to upload their own PDF drawing set to the PowerFab portal for a trial.”  
  - “Review and adjust configuration settings (deep connections, seismic, member defaults) to match project specifications.”  
  - “Perform cleanup of auto‑recognised elements before finalizing the model.” (all explicit)

---

Connection, clip and weld configuration, formulas and labor codes
- Explicit transcript statements (many detailed items):
  - “four clips there” — standard clip expectations: 2 per side = 4 total (client insisted multiple times).
  - “two clips is right there” — cases where only two were present; client requested corrections.
  - “welding along the length of the standard clip, not the width.”
  - Shear tab example: “4 in x 6 in shear tab … welding on the 4‑inch side.”
  - “burn calculation is described as thickness × width; for angles use perimeter instead of width” — transcript recorded the need to change formula for angles.
  - Created a custom “no‑rate” weld type by moving weld entries into a zero‑rate category to avoid automated labour assignment on imports (explicit steps were shown in transcript).
  - “Convert weld length: any weld longer than 20 ft can be converted to arc weld” (convert weld length option was demonstrated).
  - Labor codes: 30 “sun” codes out of the box; many require adjustment; examples included W516, Y516, Z516, Y716, HTAP.
  - Plate labor codes include heating and pre‑heat based on size; pre‑heat codes auto‑apply (explicitly stated).
  - “Full pin prep” currently applied to flanges only; desire to extend to both ends and possibly web in some cases.
  - “For angles, remove width term and use perimeter” — change applied in session.
- Observations:
  - The transcript recorded multiple corrections required to clip counts and welding placement; the client explicitly requested cleanup and formula changes.
- Explicit next steps (from transcript):
  - “Modify the angle labor‑code to reflect correct clip counts and adjust the perimeter‑based burn formula.”  
  - “Remove the weld entry from specific codes (e.g., K‑code) and create a zero‑rate weld type for imported welds.”  
  - “Test re‑import of KISS/IFC files to verify zero‑time behavior on imported welds.”  
  - “Create fillet‑weld formulas for web welds using perimeter/depth variables.” (all were explicit in transcript)

- Explicit transcript statements and numeric figures:
  - “Estimate summary” feature used to produce totals; client asked for price‑per‑pound views.
  - Explicit numbers: “$127,000 for 256,000 pounds (material cost)”; labor rate examples “50 cents a pound,” “$2 dollars a pound,” “128 cents”; “maybe twenty‑seven thousand dollars, fifteen thousand profit and then a twelve percent.”
  - Contract price example: “the contract price is 1563.”
  - Examples of large values cited across transcript: “7.5 million in the day”, “35,000… you can purchase them”, “100k reduced to 75k”, “$69,000”, “$2,200”, “$1,500”, “$600,000” (equipment), “$800–$900k”, “$31 / $55”, and many other monetary figures recorded verbatim.
  - Estimating workflow described: collect material quotes, input hours, use Pro Board/Pro‑Gortlin/Tacklion to assemble proposals; vendors fill quotes quarterly and upload to pricing database.
  - The transcript explicitly stated: “Material cost is not intact … I haven’t plugged any of my quotes into Tegrify.”
- Observations:
  - The client demonstrated methods to lock pricing, copy prices job‑specific, and to zero labour to derive material‑only price‑per‑pound calculations.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Provide guidance on configuring the estimate summary to include category‑level cost breakdowns.”  
  - “Export the Estimate Summary table for the client to review price‑per‑pound metrics.” (explicit)

---

Inventory, receiving, yard locations, cut lists and SEVA/BO integration
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - The Inventory module governs moving items, receiving, assigning location/bin and shipping.
  - Receiving workflow: enter quantity, view PO lines, enter heat number, click Receive; system records heat number and timestamps receipt; inventory updates immediately.
  - Users can assign bin locations and update item position in the grid (yard locations).
  - “If material is not allocated it can be taken from stock (Take‑from‑Stock), then it stops being tracked.”
  - BO list duplicated into SEVA and broken down to reflect steel purchases, past remnants, incoming stock. Transcript: “incredibly relevant for our steel purchases.”
  - Paint is not presently in inventory: “there’s no paint items … no paint specifications stored.” The transcript discussed 5‑gallon pails and difficulty with mixed‑size paint purchases.
  - TFSP screen for moving items and adjusting quantities (explicit).
- Observations:
  - Cut‑list / public‑cutting workflows described: selecting parts, using “eyeball” process, and the need to manually bundle identical bars; automatic grouping is not present.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Define paint inventory spec and create live items in the system.”  
  - “Implement inventory move/remove function after bin layout is defined (Christie to define bins).” (both explicitly stated)

---

Shipping, load building, calendar and rescheduling
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - Load creation: users add items to loads, check off items as loaded, the system updates load status.
  - Example: “Load 19 is not started yet; you can add/remove items; removing because ‘it’s not going to fit’ updates the load.”
  - Color legend and status symbols: orange (ownership / in progress), green (already shipped), red (supposed to ship but did not), blue (planned / 0%).
  - Shipping Calendar: drag‑and‑drop loads into days; example: satisfy “327 tons in a single week” by dragging loads; rescheduling updates visibility for “everybody involved.”
  - “Loaded” status meaning: client defined as “built on the ground,” not necessarily physically on the truck — this definition appears in the transcript.
  - Shipping Back feature was recommended: “you should start using the shipping back on your unit.”
- Observations:
  - The transcript included a recommended standing‑loader practice: mark smaller batches loaded incrementally to reduce errors.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Finalize work‑package references for items leaving the bath shop.”  
  - “Provide training / quick reference for field crews on the calendar, heartbeat/legend symbols, and the Load checkbox workflow.” (both explicit)

---

Time‑tracking, hardware procurement, and face‑scan process
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - “Time tracking through Techbud” reference; employees use Tekla for production time; other staff use Vista.
  - Face‑scan check every 30 minutes via “Sourcetree and TJ” (explicit in transcript: “Sourcetree and TJ will be over this every day and check their face scan in and against what they have.”)
  - “Mandatory morning safety stretches” are required; recorded in transcript.
  - Hardware procurement: Ricky confirmed $40,000 hardware purchase and email with purchase details to follow; truck capacity 45,000 lb mentioned.
  - Tablets: 17 tablets, large charging station, Otterbox cases every ~6 months.
  - Issues: EPN notes entry “sucks” — typing notes is cumbersome; some devices failed drives and need validation.
- Observations:
  - The vision system used for VL/inspection had improved then stopped; “vision system got better … it stopped” recorded verbatim.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Send hardware over to review team (Ricky to send)” and “include hardware cost in budget” (explicit in transcript).  
  - “Give the team a day to work with time‑tracking data” (explicit).  
  - “Record/distribute a swap‑job video tomorrow” and “perform daily 30‑minute face‑scan checks.” (explicit)

---

Nesting, Pro‑Nest, plate inventory (Prodisk) and cut workflows
- Explicit transcript statements:
  - Plate nesting described: select plates → Nest with Pro‑Nest → generate nesting file → import into PowerFab (via Progress integration) → plate inventory controlled by Prodisk.
  - “Plate inventory will then be controlled by Prodisk” (explicit).
  - “Create cuts, combine via purchase‑order speed bid” — cuts were generated and combined into PO speed‑bid in session.
- Observations:
  - Pro‑Nest integration and additional modules were noted as required for more efficient nesting.
- Explicit next steps:
  - “Enable Pro‑Nest / added modules and validate Pro‑Nest flow into Prodisk for plate inventory” (explicitly discussed).
