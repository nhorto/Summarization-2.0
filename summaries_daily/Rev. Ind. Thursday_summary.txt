Professional Topic-Based Consulting Summary

Opening statement
This day-long session focused on aligning Tekla PowerFab workflows across administration, project management, production control, estimating, purchasing, IT/data integration, and Go-enabled tools, with emphasis on data flow, configurations, and next-step actions.

ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION / ADMINISTRATION
- Reviewed informal kickoff notes, participant dynamics, and broad governance context; multiple sessions and on-site planning were referenced, with no firm administrative decisions captured in the transcript.
- Noted references to sharing artifacts (drawings, Bitbucket artifacts) and ongoing planning for follow-up discussions and action items.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: continued planning and scheduling of follow-up discussions; concrete task lists were not itemized in this topic.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
- Reviewed tooling and data flow between Jira, Trello, Bitbucket, Loom, and MediRoute as part of the project workflow.
- Discussed progress- and file-generation concepts such as “progress integration” that spits out a file used in production-control workflows.
- Covered the relationship between work packages, drawings access, piece tracking, and project visibility; emphasized the intent to align work packages with drawings and production data.
- Talked about scheduling signals (starting next week) and how to begin or advance activities in near term; some items required clarification in subsequent meetings.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: continue refining work packages, confirm how routing and start/stop triggers are applied, and align inspections and reporting workflows with project data.

IT SECURITY / DATA INTEGRATION
- Acknowledged a multi-tool ecosystem (Bitbucket, Jira, Trello, Loom, MediRoute) and security considerations around access governance and data integration.
- Referenced security hubs and the need to integrate security considerations into tool governance, though no specific security configuration was enacted in this transcript.
- Plan to assemble user-access lists and test provisioning workflows; several items referenced ongoing IT actions, including onboarding and access testing.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: continue evaluating tool integrations (Atlassian stack plus third-party integrations), and confirm user provisioning and access controls for project participants.

PRODUCTION CONTROL / SHOP CONFIGURATION
- Discussed old vs. new shop/settings handling, including plans to dump old settings and set up a different shop; emphasis on controlled rollout and rapid change management.
- Highlighted expectations for faster change management and tool responsiveness as configurations are updated.
- Reviewed device provisioning, shop floor tablet deployment, and on-site user provisioning to support production workflows.
- Addressed shop layout changes and the need to map areas, pockets, and yards to improve visibility of production activities.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: finalize device provisioning plans, implement/validate new shop configurations, and refine how changes are rolled out across the production environment.

ESTIMATING
- Covered model import workflows, parametric assemblies, and labor-code management; discussed approximately 30 labor codes and the need to expose more codes for estimating.
- Discussed two broad estimating approaches: piece-by-piece vs. geometry-driven (parametric) estimation, highlighting the role of accurate labeling in enabling faster labor-coding across projects.
- Addressed labor-code governance, including creating new codes, duplicating existing codes for variations, and the need to minimize manual adjustments to improve estimator buy-in.
- Examined data flows between estimating, production control, and external systems (pricing databases, Tegrify, Integrity, Salesforce); noted that quotes and material pricing often originate from external sources and flow into Tekla PowerFab workflows.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: build out additional labor cases, expand labor-code coverage, validate AI-assisted labeling concepts, and test end-to-end estimating with model imports and producer-side data flows.

PURCHASING
- Covered centralized vs. decentralized purchasing concepts and supplier engagement strategies; discussed multi-vendor quotes and the potential benefits of consolidating purchasing for leverage.
- Addressed hardware procurement items (e.g., tablets) and budget considerations; discussed master agreements and vendor relationships influencing purchasing decisions.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: continue refining the purchasing workflow, test vendor quote flows, and decide on consolidation vs. distribution of purchasing across shops.

POWERFAB GO
- PowerFab Go was referenced across several segments as a tablet/field-access workflow and Go-enabled interface; specific demonstrations or configurations were described but not exhaustively captured in this transcript.
- Discussed onboarding logistics, licensing considerations (notably a referenced $2,500 license in one portion), and device provisioning for on-site Go usage.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: schedule go-training, confirm device provisioning timelines, and validate licensing implications for field use.

DETAILED STANDARDS / QA / QC
- Deliberated detailing standards related to welding, end prep, clip counts, and related formulas; many topics centered on ensuring consistent end treatments, clip distributions, and burn calculations.
- Discussed end prep configurations (K, D, E, L) and the need to align prep and welding with fabricator expectations; considered expanding prep to web where appropriate.
- Examined labeling practices, AI-assisted labeling, and the impact of labeling quality on detailing speed and accuracy.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: implement updated detailing rules (end-prep, clip behavior), validate weld/clip configurations, and align with fabrication practices through test runs.

QA / INSPECTIONS
- Various references to inspection readiness and inspection workflows appeared, including planned beta/production readiness for inspection features; however, concrete inspection configurations were not finalized in this transcript.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: continue configuring inspections on project basis as readiness progresses and integrate with production status where applicable.

DRAWINGS / DOCUMENTATION ACCESS
- Referenced drawing access via drawing lists, PDF drawings, and the linking of drawings to work packages and project data.
- Discussed revision control (Rev A vs Rev 0) and the importance of maintaining current revisions and drawing logs; noted server path and directory considerations affecting access.
- Next steps explicitly mentioned: verify directory links, ensure consistent drawing revision access, and link drawings to work packages and inspections as appropriate.

QA/QC / INSPECTIONS (combining two related segments)
- Across multiple topics, inspections and QA/QC capabilities were discussed in the context of production status, coatings, and workflow integrations; no single formal action item was captured, but the thread indicated ongoing development of QA/QC integration with production data.

CLOSING STATEMENT
Progress was made toward tighter integration of administrative, estimating, purchasing, and production-control workflows within Tekla PowerFab, with explicit next steps for go-live planning, labelling and detailing standardization, data integration tests, and device provisioning for field use. Several topics require follow-up in subsequent sessions, including detailed testing of go-enabled workflows, verification of data flow between Tekla and external systems, and finalization of inspection and reporting configurations.

Optional closing
The session captured a broad spectrum of topics—from administrative governance to field-ready PowerFab Go usage—highlighting concrete areas for follow-up and validation to advance end-to-end project delivery.
