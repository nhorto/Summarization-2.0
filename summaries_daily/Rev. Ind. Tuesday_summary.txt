  - Re-establish administrative privileges for relevant plugins and review Vista/Tecla data-flow governance to avoid duplicate processes.

PURCHASING
- What was reviewed / covered
  - The morning objective centered on inventory cleanup and stock-taking; multiple open POs needed finalization or formal approval.
  - Clarified what “fully received” meant for closing POs; one PO was identified as fully received with remaining “buy items” unassociated and outside finalized status.
  - The PO data flow involved closing POs as fully received, removing related line items from the open-order view, and then approving the PO to complete the workflow.
  - Historical context described a shift from a different system to Vista for PO management; the current process duplicated data handling to support Vista’s itemization.
  - Vista’s changes altered how line items were broken out and managed, implying updated itemization compared with prior practices.
- Key findings / observations
  - There was ongoing transition to Vista-based PO management, with duplication of processes during the transition.
  - There were open POs and a need to finalize and align fulfillment with receiving/shipments.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - PURCHASING: Add the finalized PO workflow to the process so that, after receiving and completing shipping/receiving tasks, the PO is finalized; determine who has authority to approve/finalize (Ricky and Tom or shipping).
  - PURCHASING: Review and align Vista/Tecla integration to reflect PO data flow and ensure proper cross-system synchronization.
  - PURCHASING: Locate information about the specific method or tool used for finalization if not clearly documented in this session.
  - PURCHASING: Prepare for AI audit by engaging identified key personnel and clarifying audit scope and roles (connected to governance and cross-system traceability).

PRODUCTION CONTROL / INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
- What was reviewed / covered
  - The day’s main objective was inventory cleanup and stocktaking; substantial cleanup work was in progress with consolidation/standardization (umbrella loading) due to unfinalized data assets.
  - A large inventory weight (over 1,000,000 pounds) was discussed, with on-order weight not yet reflecting cleanup, creating misalignment between stock and on-order data.
  - Ongoing cleanup efforts aimed to maintain accurate inventory records as items were finalized and moved through the system.
  - There were discussions of overlays and bin-location planning (e.g., whip bins) to improve material tracking; five acres of space were referenced for bin-location planning and material placement.
  - Receiving/finalization processes were described: attaching documents to items, visibility of open orders until finalization, and an example where a line item showed as not finalized (e.g., 22 gauge with weight not yet in the system).
- Key findings / observations
  - There existed a misalignment between on-order data and stock records, requiring ongoing reconciliation; large on-order quantities and future arrivals were forecast (e.g., 300 tons projected in the system but not yet received).
  - Yard vs. warehouse organization and space utilization were critical; overlays and bin-location planning were planned to improve tracking and space efficiency.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Continue aligning stock vs. on-order data; work toward ensuring on-order quantities, stock levels, and backlog reflect the same reality; monitor incoming POs (e.g., 300 tons) and update stock projections; consider implementing bin-location overlays for improved tracking.
  - BIN LOCATION PLANNING: Complete the area layout and meet with Mark to discuss the impact on space utilization and material placement.
  - RECEIVING / FINALIZATION: Continue refining the receiving/finalization workflow and ensure orders are finalized before they move to inventory history or inventory.
  - IT AUTOMATION: Re-establish access to automation tools (AutoHotKey), restore executive-order-driven automation, and evaluate scripts for automation (e.g., ChatGPT-generated scripts).

WAREHOUSE OPERATIONS / BIN LOCATION PLANNING
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Five acres of space were discussed for bin-location planning; intent to implement overlays of whip bins and inventory locations to improve material tracking; plan to discuss area-layout changes with Mark.
- Key findings / observations
  - There was a clear emphasis on space-utilization optimization and bin-location overlays to support material tracking and forecasting.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - Complete area-layout planning and meet with Mark to discuss impact on space utilization and material placement.

RECEIVING / FINALIZATION PROCESS
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Receiving attaches documents to items; items are not removed from delete-order until finalization; orders remain visible if not finalized; an example line item showed data incomplete until finalization.
- Key findings / observations
  - The finalization step is essential to move items from open/receiving status to completed inventory status; data completeness at the item/line-item level directly affects stock visibility.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - Continue refining the finalization process to ensure line items finalize after receiving tasks are completed and associated data (weights, data fields) are populated.

IT AUTOMATION / DATA INTEGRATION
- What was reviewed / covered
  - AutoHotKey was discussed as a tool; access prerequisites and an executive-order-driven automation program were described, including an expired executive order to be restored.
  - Scripts via AI assistance (e.g., ChatGPT) were suggested as a potential automation path, subject to access/version considerations.
- Key findings / observations
  - There was active interest in re-establishing automation for PO receiving/stock-tracking workflows and for automating data-entry tasks.

  - Locate information about exact tools/methods used for finalizing POs and data-flow governance.
  - Ensure governance alignment with Vista migration and cross-system data flows.

QA / QA/QC / DETAILING STANDARDS
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Several sessions addressed QA/QC controls within receiving, inventory, coatings, and routing; examples included dual approvals, line-item heat-number tracking, and AISC references.
  - There were discussions around the use of remarks, heats, and location-based tracking; operators assigned remarks to items.
  - The interaction between QA/QC and data-entry forms, inspections, and traceability was explored.
- Key findings / observations
  - There was a focus on traceability of QA/QC data with heat-number tracking, remarks linked to items, and alignment to standards (e.g., AISC references).
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - No single concrete QA/QC action item; several sessions indicated continuing use of remark/heat-number tracking and alignment with standards. In other topics, there were explicit QA/QC form-design actions (see Detailing Standards).

DETAILING STANDARDS
- What was reviewed / covered
  - The detailing team was described as active in specific workstreams (e.g., Arizona water tank) and coordinating with fabrication processes.
  - There was a plan to design forms and data entry around SP-based standards (SP2/SP3/SP6/SP10, SP13 later) and to align coatings with fabrication routes.
  - Discussions included labeling conventions (flag plates) and standardization of data entry for detailing tasks.
- Key findings / observations
  - SP-based standardization and coatings-related routing were central to detailing discussions; form architecture and data-fields were being considered to support traceability.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - Finalize first-field design for SP-based standards (which SPs to expose as dropdowns, which fields are checkboxes, etc.).
  - Validate SP-based logic for galvanizing scenarios and coatings-related inspections.
  - Decide on the categorization structure (site docs vs environmental vs other) and begin migrating forms piece-by-piece.

POWERFAB GO
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Several mentions addressed how PowerFab Go would handle data capture (checks, inspections, attachments) and how forms and evidence could be created inside PowerFab for real-time updates.
  - Considerations included whether data would populate PowerFab (checks, inspections, documentation) and how attachments (pictures) would be stored/referenced.
- Key findings / observations
  - There was a clear drive to model inspections, environmental/paint data, and KC (knowledge capture) within PowerFab, with attachments linked via a document index rather than embedded in the database.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - Prototype environmental and paint-log forms within PowerFab; attach supporting pictures; verify alignment with customer reporting requirements; consider site-wide KC data capture.

DATA INTEGRATION / REPORTING / DATA VISIBILITY
- What was reviewed / covered
  - Cross-project reporting capabilities and filtering by finishes, SP levels, and codes; the desire to pull data by path/route and show square footage by route or station; discussions of Excel-based exports and pivot-table analyses.
  - There were concerns about the reliability of data populations, and the need to validate data-import processes (e.g., Kiss file, Excel imports) and to synchronize with reporting outputs.
- Key findings / observations
  - Reporting and data visibility were emphasized; there was ongoing tension between data in PowerFab and externally sourced data (Excel, Kiss files) and the need to consolidate into a single, auditable workflow.
- Next steps (explicitly mentioned)
  - Test and finalize new data-integration approaches (zero-cost labor entries; separate rate boards; global paint code) and validate reporting outputs (per job, per route, per finish) prior to broader deployment.
  - Prepare for integration discussions (tomorrow) and bring supporting text/data to the session.
