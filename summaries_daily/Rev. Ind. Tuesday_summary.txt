Prepared from verbatim transcript (no assumptions or additions)

Note: All items below are drawn directly and only from the session transcript. Numbers, tool names, version references and quotations are preserved as spoken.

------------------------------------------------------------
TOPICS & DETAILED CAPTURE
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Database duplication, SQL/server state and system performance
- What was discussed / observed
  - A duplicate of “the entire database in a separate” environment was being created; that duplication “explains why everything’s super slow.”
  - The duplication process “started the process last Thursday.”
  - Ricky reported “unsure where the hiccups are coming in now, like the SQL Service manager,” and that it was “not doing the naming.”
  - Ricky said he “has been waiting for them to give me the new port number” and had followed up “this morning”; the new port had not yet been provided.
  - Ricky requested: “Give me access to SQL and I’ll just take a while. I have it… you have access to the server there.” He also stated “They don’t trust me with that… the guy that it does is sitting in my office now.”
  - The plugin was confirmed as admin.
  - A restart of the server was described as taking “about 1 minute”; if the server needs restart “all of our drives go down” and every computer “must be manually restarted.” Typical downtime after issues was said to last “about 20 minutes.”
- Versions and compatibility explicitly mentioned
  - The environment was running **SQL 2019** (explicit question whether behavior was linked to SQL 2019).
  - A documentation note referenced that the application “requires Windows Server 2025 as a base OS,” but Ricky said “Our SQL should be able to run this just fine.”
  - Upgrade/version references: the client was “originally on **8.43** (or something like that)”; later versions mentioned **8.4** and **8.1** as relevant for the 2019 environment. An upgrade to **2025** while still on **SQL 5.0** previously “caused problems.”
- Impact / risk
  - Ongoing duplication and SQL/service issues were explicitly linked to system slowness and inability to reliably run modules or open large inventory lists (“it literally took like four or five minutes to open the inventory”).
  - Permission constraints (“They don’t trust me”) were noted as impeding troubleshooting.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Obtain new SQL port number and confirm configuration. (owner: Database admin / Ricky — stated as “ASAP” in transcript excerpts)
  - Verify and document SQL server access rights / admin access (owner noted as IT / Ricky).
  - Restart SQL/remote server and/or SQL service was discussed as a troubleshooting step (owner: IT / client; Ricky to message IT).

------------------------------------------------------------
2) Inventory clean‑up, weights, backlog and forecasting
- What was reviewed / observed
  - Primary morning goal: “Inventory clean up taking stocks.”
  - Progress: “A good portion of our taking stock clean up is being cleaned up… there are some videos that are unfinalized.”
  - Inventory prior and current figures:
    - Inventory was “over **1,000,000 lb** before.”
    - The inventory screen showed **“Weight on Order = 1,063,145 lb.”**
    - A large weight figure of **241,927** was cited (transcript did not specify units).
    - A referenced weight/volume density: **1.25 lb / ft²**.
    - A line item (“08”) showed **22‑gauge** material **without a weight recorded**.
  - Backlog and variance comments:
    - The backlog was described as “roughly half a million pounds” with an estimated variance of **±100,000 lb**.
    - The backlog was characterized as material “that has been ‘brought against’ but not yet reflected in the order totals.”
  - Forecasts:
    - The team projected **an additional 300 tons of steel** (explicitly equated elsewhere in session as ≈ **600,000 lb**) arriving on new purchase orders not yet received.
  - Other inventory counts:
    - Fittings inventory quoted as **10,100 fittings** and “40,000 of these.” (as stated)
- Impact / risk
  - After clean‑up, the on‑order weight “still reflects the same,” indicating reconciliation was incomplete.
  - Yard space constraint was explicitly referenced in relation to the incoming 300‑ton forecast.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Complete inventory clean‑up and confirm final weight totals (owner: Inventory team; timeframe noted as end of day in session notes).
  - Monitor incoming 300‑ton steel forecast and update system once POs are received.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) Purchase Orders (PO) finalisation, open POs and workflow constraints
- Current PO state and process
  - A PO was described as “fully received at this point… with the exception of the buy items because not associated.”
  - Required finalisation steps that were explicitly stated:
    - Finalize items so they no longer appear in the inventory system.
    - Approve the purchase order to close it.
  - Editing restriction: “This can’t be edited out to this point unless you go in and unlock it and roll with approval.”
- Historical/process flow
  - Original flow: “We originally used to do all of our purchase orders in … that was our governing guide.”
  - A duplicate flow was created “so that we could generally cut this and handle all the data.”
  - Transition to **Vista**: with Vista the team no longer “have to break out the line items”; Vista “now pulls only the PO number” and detailed line data is tracked within Tekla.
  - Standard manual steps: generate PO in Vista to obtain Vista PO number, copy PO number into Tekla, and push PO data back into Vista as needed.
  - Attempts to allow Tekla to create PO numbers were discussed but conclusion was “Vista must still be used to create the PO” (reference: “stupid PO number that they want”).
- Automation / batching limitations and tools
  - The transcript explicitly stated: “There isn’t a way to batch funds and SP OS.”
  - Historical workaround: a client with old unfinalized items used “some tool… a script they wrote.”
  - Script/program details:
    - “There wasn’t a script” but “there were some programs you can sit in there.”
    - The automation that was used was “not Power BI”; another program “creates short passes” and runs keyboard‑type commands (e.g., “control‑T”‑type).
    - Auto‑finalization was previously implemented so “every night they finalized all their ideas.”
  - AutoHotKey:
    - Ricky received **videos** demonstrating use of **AutoHotKey** for automation.
    - Ricky had “requested the scripts” from the provider; the original download link “expired,” and Ricky said he would **email the provider to request reinstatement**.
- Open/unfinalized video items and POs
  - Items described as “videos from the whole projects and we never really got it as a portal.”
  - Procedural need: “Procedures to go back in and finalize and approve them formally in the system.”
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Identify and retrieve the script/program used by the five‑year‑old client for PO finalisation (owner: Ricky with help from team; stated “Next working day”).
  - Locate the person responsible for the nightly auto‑finalisation routine and document the process (owner: Ricky; noted as ongoing).
  - Review and close all open purchase orders that are fully received, following the documented PO finalisation flow (owner: Purchasing staff; labeled as current sprint).

------------------------------------------------------------
4) Integration (Vista ↔ Tekla), import/export, and labor codes
- Integration scope and limits (explicit)
  - The primary integration goal cited was to *sync labor codes* between Vista and Tekla; the transcript explicitly said “this capability is not currently available.”
  - Existing pushes into the integration include **PA use**, **PA receipts**, and **transactions**—these were said to be “the only items technically pushing into the integration.”
  - Integration was described as an **import‑export in the background** that required **human intervention** to trigger transfers.
  - Manual PO creation in Vista remains standard: “there is no automatic ‘physical pushing’ of POs into Vista.”
  - The system “can be set up now to run automatically” if desired, but current state required manual entry.
- Company/PO numbering anomalies (explicit)
  - POS were identified as **41**; a reference to **company 36** was made and described as “closed out.”
  - The consultant described receiving orders for “42 liter” and a shift to “I’ll start with a 49 instead of a three,” indicating PO/company‑numbering confusion (as explicitly spoken).
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - The consultant and client agreed to “talk again about the integration of labor codes (currently unavailable).” No date was specified.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) Test / training environments and test data handling
- What was discussed / observed
  - The client said “when we’ve had trainees or new employees… the steel that will never be received,” and the consultant recommended deleting test jobs once they are no longer needed.
  - The client indicated they do training in a separate test company that is “not commingled with production data.”
  - The client admitted: “Those two entities don’t do any training in the real company,” but also earlier said they had “never had a testing environment… a huge portion of us… never really had a testing environment.”
  - The lack of an implemented testing environment was explicitly called “probably an issue.”
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Delete test jobs and ensure test data is not commingled with production (no owner specified; recommendation in transcript).

------------------------------------------------------------
6) Inventory location / bin management, yard planning and spatial constraints
- What was reviewed / observed
  - Discussion of **bin/whip overlays** on a **five‑acre area** to visualize and allocate material locations.
  - The intent was to create specific bin locations and associate inventory with those locations. The user said “I cannot create these locations within the system at this time.”
  - A future meeting with **Mark** was explicitly planned to “talk about the battle between” (i.e., resolve location‑assignment issues).
  - Yard space concern was explicitly tied to forecasted incoming steel (300 tons ≈ 600,000 lb).
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Schedule a meeting with Mark to resolve bin‑location creation and assignment (owner: Ricky — stated).

------------------------------------------------------------
7) AutoHotKey / automation, scripts and access to provider content
- What was discussed / observed
  - Ricky received videos demonstrating **AutoHotKey** usage and had requested the actual scripts.
  - He noted that the provider’s original download link had expired and he would **email the provider** to request reinstatement.
  - The consultant stated the automation that was used previously was **not Power BI** and was “some other program” creating short passes and keyboard commands.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Ricky to email the AutoHotKey/script provider to reinstate the expired download link (owner: Ricky; stated in transcript).

------------------------------------------------------------
8) Receiving workflow, zero‑dollar PO and BOM → production control
- Explicit workflow discussed
  - Desired workflow outlined: Production control generates a **Bill of Materials**, push the BOM to a **zero‑dollar purchase order** (“I’m pushing it over to a zero dollar PO”), then track receiving and production.
  - Sub‑contractor PO scenario was described: “If you give them a subcontractor PO on picking the inventory, they’ll have the recipient.”
  - The client described receiving mixed truckloads and the need for lot numbers or BOLs to organize pieces; recommended creating a $0.00 PO for incoming shipments to get visibility.
- Wire‑spool inventory request (explicit)
  - The client wanted an **inventory system for spools of wire** and cut‑length tiers: **500 ft, 1,000 ft, 1,500 ft, and 2,000 ft**.
  - The wire spool inventory must be separate from the steel inventory (or “one connect”) so production jobs remain distinct; the client intended to “load their own models” without affecting steel inventory.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Define an inventory entity for wire spools separate from the steel inventory (owner: client / PowerFab configurator; requirements captured).

------------------------------------------------------------
9) Estimating, historic pricing lookup, Excel vs PowerFab data entry and KISS files
- Fields and minimal data set requested (explicit)
  - For a truckload import the client listed the required attributes per piece: **drawing number, main mark, piece mark, quantity, shape, grade, size, length** (“that’s the main style benefits”).
- Excel vs PowerFab discussion (explicit)
  - The client stated “I’m an Excel guy” but acknowledged PowerFab “has built‑in controls”; Excel permits entry of sizes PowerFab would reject (e.g., typing non‑existent sizes).
  - The client asked to see a live example “Can we put one in to show them how to do it?”
- KISS files and import problems (explicit)
  - The transcript included a prior job where the supplier delivered “KISS files” that were “screwed up” with metric and imperial mixed.
  - The client expected suppliers to produce usable files and stated “the files should not be a problem” but confirmed import effort/time was a concern (“how much time to take put that stuff in there”).
- Historical pricing and quick lookup (explicit)
  - The consultant demonstrated a date‑sorted filter pulling pricing from **2024** purchase history.
  - A 20‑minute lookup example provided a baseline price range (in transcript: **$7,166 to $0.74**) and noted a $0.25 “underweight” line item existed previously.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Clarify file format requirements for imports (e.g., Michigan board file) and validate supplier capability to deliver clean files.
  - Demonstrate entering a piece mark in PowerFab live (client request).

------------------------------------------------------------
10) Site Docs, forms, inspection workflow and migration/licensing
- Forms and Site Docs migration discussion (explicit)
  - Client considered moving from Site Docs to a new system; management was “pressuring” to discontinue Site Docs while team felt “it is not broken.”
  - The consultant agreed to demo the alternative to show how it would look/function before migration.
- Inspection model and form capabilities (explicit)
  - Forms can be piece‑by‑piece or general; they can include checkboxes, dropdowns, text, numeric, date and memo fields.
  - Pictures can be attached to forms; photos are stored on the server and a document index holds links (database stores link, not image).
  - Forms can be used for environmental logs (collect humidity/temperature), and pictures of gauges were explicitly discussed as evidence.
  - The client confirmed “pre‑built” standard inspection forms exist on the site but the client chose not to migrate them; piece‑by‑piece approach was used.
- Licensing / Ports / BP access (explicit)
  - Replacing Site Docs required licenses; the consultant said a basic permission (“BP”) access was “significantly cheaper (≈ $15 per employee).”
  - Potential contact names mentioned: **Chris Pinium** (license point), **Alan** (already has access).
- Mobile / tablet usage (explicit)
  - Forms and inspections are digital and can be completed live on tablets (iPad) and do not require transcription.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Demo the alternative form solution and perform a site‑doc demo (owner: consultant).
  - Issue BP licenses to field inspectors as a lower‑cost option (owner: client licensing admin — Chris Pinium referenced).

------------------------------------------------------------
11) Paint/Coating specifics, estimating inputs, coverage and product data
- Paint/coating codes and readiness (explicit)
  - **SP2** and **SP3** were mentioned as the only coating codes currently functional; **SP6**, **SP10**, and others were also referenced across the session.
  - Coating techniques discussed: **pressure wash, brushed blast, pan blast, steel shot; possible epoxy** variants.
  - The finish field could hold a breakdown (e.g., SB, simple or complex).
- Product/quantity/pricing and container sizes (explicit)
  - Paint manufacturer: **Sherwin** (stated). Price references: **$49** (cost per gallon referenced) and **160** was cited in some contexts (transcript ambiguity).
  - Coverage options and related values: maintain coverage at **1:50** or change to **1.5** (both spoken).
  - Container sizes discussed: **5 gal** (standard) and **36 gal** referenced; also references to **5 gallons and 36**.
  - Minimum order increment example: **0.75 L → rounded up to 1 L** (explicit).
  - Macrobox sizes referenced: “either **2** or **10 k** (spoken).”
  - Waste factor explicitly stated: **50 % waste** for paint carrying/spread allowance.
  - Specific paint volumes called out in session: **52 gal**, **122 gal**, **140** (per‑gallon references).
- Labor and productivity (explicit)
  - Baseline painting productivity explicitly set to **100 sq ft per hour**.
  - Labor multiplier/double‑layer: a **2× multiplier** was discussed for macro‑oxy vs primer (explicit).
  - Crew model: the painter plus pot‑tender (two personnel); referenced that two people may each be counted in time for a single hour of work (explicit).
  - Efficiency discussion: default **75%** efficiency was in place; client requested raising target to **90–95%** for upcoming bid (explicit).
  - Cleaning benchmarks: **600 sq ft / hour** (solid cleaning) and **1,000 sq ft / hour** (power‑tool cleaning) were stated as reference figures.
  - Some numerical references: **1.25 lb/ft²** density, and a specific numeric **82 sq ft → 48 minutes** example (derived using 100 sf/hr in transcript).
- Consumables (explicit)
  - Thinners and other consumables were discussed as costs that must be picked up and captured (explicit).
  - Example: a thinner / paint cost conversation included **$29 add 5 bucks** and **$160** but contexts were not fully disambiguated; these numbers were explicitly spoken in the transcript.
- Paint logs, environmental measurements and QC (explicit)
  - Clients required a **paint log** capturing environmental conditions (humidity “needs to be 30%” and temperature).
  - The team took pictures of gauges and attached them to forms; environmental data could be attached as evidence and included automatically in reports.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Populate paint spec/product codes and confirm container sizes, coverage and per‑gallon pricing (owner: consultant/client; specific owner not provided in transcript).
  - Add fields to capture thinner cost and quantities (owner: consultant/client; action noted).

------------------------------------------------------------
12) Shop floor tracking, Start/Stop, batches, tablets and production tracking
- Start/Stop and batch processing (explicit)
  - The “Add” (single piece) and “Add batch” (multiple pieces, e.g., 25 pieces painted together) workflow was demonstrated and discussed.
  - The tablet (iPad) and desktop production screens both show status; status updates required a refresh to appear across devices.
  - The Start button begins timing; Stop ends it and populates the hours/minutes fields (fields remain blank while timer is running).
  - There is **no global start/stop** for an entire batch; individual Start/Stop per piece or per operation is required (“there is no higher‑level start‑stop capability”).
  - Some floor personnel do not currently use the Start/Stop button; the consultant suggested greater adoption for equipment monitoring/health and productivity capture.
- Time capture and mirroring (explicit)
  - Timers populate only after a Stop event; “Reset” clears current timing; “Stop” aborts current run and the job records elapsed hours.
  - The “mirroring” feature was described as inflating recorded time in some cases and was criticized.
- Max update and feature 2046 (explicit)
  - A **“Max update”** (described as a “cheater button”) forces the system to mark selected items as completed when pressed.
  - **Feature 2046** was explicitly called out: it requires **production to be finished before shipping** becomes an option.
- Work‑package UI (explicit)
  - Work Package view is accessible by clicking the up‑side‑down triangle in the production tracking window; tablet recommendations included keeping the screen on during operations.
- Start/Stop practical observations (explicit)
  - Example painting batch durations: truckload of steel batch painting estimated at **3–4 hours** with multiple paint rigs possible per day.
  - Painter setup / mixing: “mixing and preparing paint for a batch takes about an hour for two days to get the paint gather to mix up” (verbatim).
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Train floor staff on Start/Stop usage and batch workflows (owner: client/consultant — training recommended).
  - Validate tablet synchronization after refresh (no owner specified).

------------------------------------------------------------
13) Quality Control (QC), inspection forms, flags and environmental checks
- QC checkpoints and inspection workflow (explicit)
  - QC was described as performed **after prep** and **after each total**; for prep “100% of items” are inspected; subsequent stages use sampling based on contract requirements.
  - Inspectors “check off peace marks” and take photos where the report requires them; photos are attached to records/forms.
  - Inspection can be tied to a station so that the system prevents movement to the next step until required checks are marked completed.
  - A “sampling” percentage is not automatically handled — the user must select sampling behavior manually.
- Forms, reporting and attachments (explicit)
  - Forms can be created in PowerFab and become formal documents/records (e.g., environmental forms).
  - Forms can be configured to include a set of fields and support picture attachments; pictures are saved on the server and linked via an index.
  - Reports can be generated from forms and emailed directly from the system.
- Flagging (explicit)
  - A colour‑coded flagging system was discussed: different colours for movable items vs non‑movable; client did not currently use flagging and rare service issues were handled with boot‑tape marking instead.
- Environmental monitoring (explicit)
  - Environmental forms require capturing humidity and temperature (example: humidity “needs to be 30%”); a picture of the gauge was used as proof.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Integrate paint‑log forms into PowerFab with picture attachment and environmental fields (owner: consultant/client).
  - Evaluate feasibility of introducing a color‑coded flagging/taping system (owner: consultant/client).

------------------------------------------------------------
14) Production planning, scheduling and planner tools (Microsoft Project / Production Planner 2025)
- Tools and capabilities discussed (explicit)
  - The PowerFab scheduling module was compared to **Microsoft Project**; both support start/finish relationships and Gantt charts.
  - **Production Planner 2025** is referenced as a more in‑depth planner and includes a Production Planner that supports active production tracking and forecasting.
  - Planner can show scheduled hours, % complete and a timeline; it does not incorporate costing (explicit).
  - Planner supports prediction of booked weeks and available weeks; work packages can be auto‑populated with estimated hours and dragged into weeks.
- Methodologies (explicit)
  - CPM (Critical Path Method) was described as “assumes everything goes right”; Last Planner was described as focusing on realistic constraints and is commonly used in construction.
- Licensing & access (explicit)
  - A license lock‑out was reported for a set of projects, and “no payment had been made for licensure control” per transcript, though later “all licenses have been switched.”
- Support and troubleshooting (explicit)
  - Support response times were stated as typically **2–3 hours maximum** and sometimes within 5 minutes.
  - A recurring UI “spinning wheel of death” was reported; reproducing it for support was suggested.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Verify license status and ensure correct assignment (owner: client IT / licensing team).
  - Investigate and resolve “spinning wheel” UI freeze (owner: support engineer).

------------------------------------------------------------
15) Data/reporting gaps, historical cost tracking and “Costco‑style” tracking
- Data/reporting limitations explicitly stated
  - Client wanted “one line‑item per material” to enable historical cost queries, but currently “you couldn’t tell me how many beans you bought in the last year.”
  - The estimate can break down costs by cost code and the consultant referenced estimate **251819** as an example.
  - Existing reports do not provide a single consolidated view of paint gallons purchased vs used; extraction via filters and Excel exports was recommended.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Create a one‑line‑item per material reporting template (owner: consultant/client — proposed).
  - Map accounting fields (QuickBooks / Foundation) to Tekla fields to remove manual house‑codes (owner: client/consultant).

------------------------------------------------------------
16) Paint media, abrasive quantities and pricing examples (explicit)
- Media / abrasive numbers and costs (verbatim)
  - Minimum abrasive cost stated as **$4,400**.
  - Required volume “**5.8 bags** – need to round up to **6 bags**.”
  - A weight/price figure was cited: **25,467 lb** and **47 cents** (spoken).
  - Media cost examples: **$12,500** (central right span) and “last media … $17,000.”
  - Recycling: “We use steel grid and get **200 turns** out of it.”
  - Procurement options: truckload with **10 super sacks** at **2 tons each**, or consignment and charge jobs per day.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Confirm abrasive order quantities (6 bags), pricing and reconcile with lb figure (owner: client/estimating).

------------------------------------------------------------
17) Piece‑level production import, route handling and KISS / COG tools
- Import and handling (explicit)
  - The client can pre‑build routes from a **KISS file**; if a KISS file is present “we pre‑build these routes.”
  - The client described a desired simple import workflow: minimal fields per piece (drawing, marks, qty, shape, grade, size, length).
  - The client referenced an AI tool “**COG**” that “does not stall on engineering connections” and was praised for automation of structural elements (explicit).
- Issues with suppliers’ files (explicit)
  - Examples were given of suppliers delivering bad files (metric/imperial mixed), requiring clean‑up.
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Validate supplier file formats and tolerance for mixed units before import (owner: client/consultant).

------------------------------------------------------------
18) Permissions, licensing visibility and user counts
- Licensing and permissions issues explicitly stated
  - Some users “do not have licenses,” and therefore cannot see certain inventory quantities.
  - BP/basic permission license cost referenced as **≈ $15 per employee** for field users (explicit).
  - The client asked, “Can you tell the number of users we talked to?” and referenced “we’ve had 15 months, we’re all actively showing on that” (verbatim).
- Explicit action items recorded in transcript
  - Review licensing allocations so relevant personnel can view/manage inventory data (owner: client licensing admin).

------------------------------------------------------------
19) Action‑item compilation (items explicitly stated in transcript)
- Items explicitly recorded in the transcript (verbatim where owners were named):
  - Obtain new SQL port number and confirm configuration. (owner: Database admin / Ricky — stated “ASAP”)
  - Verify and document access rights for SQL server (admin plugin status). (owner: IT / Ricky — “Immediate”)
  - Complete inventory clean‑up, confirm final weight totals. (owner: Inventory team — “End of day”)
  - Identify and retrieve the script/program used by the five‑year‑old client for PO finalisation. (owner: Ricky (with help from team) — “Next working day”)
  - Locate the person responsible for the nightly auto‑finalisation routine and document the process. (owner: Ricky — “Ongoing”)
  - Review and close open purchase orders that are fully received, following the documented PO finalisation flow. (owner: Purchasing staff — “Current sprint”)
  - Align January budget review with current PO and inventory status. (owner: Finance / Ricky — “January (as noted)”)
  - Ricky to email the AutoHotKey/script provider to restore expired download link. (owner: Ricky — explicit)
  - Schedule meeting with Mark to resolve bin‑location creation/assignment. (owner: Ricky — explicit)

  - Define inventory entity for wire spools with tiers 500/1,000/1,500/2,000 ft (owner: client / PowerFab configurator — explicit)

------------------------------------------------------------
20) Errors, UI issues and support/ticketing
- Issues explicitly mentioned
  - Job‑site add/save caused program to hang/crash on **Service Pack 3**; support suggested **Service Pack 5** as fix.
  - “Spinning/lock‑up” (spinning wheel of death) was a recurring UI problem and required logs/submission.
  - Duplicate database process had been started and was taking multiple days (explicit “since last Thursday”).
  - Import of KISS/Excel into Estimating was claimed to lock up the Estimating module “every single time.”
- Support mechanisms (explicit)
  - The system includes a built‑in support ticket feature that automatically gathers logs and background data.
  - Support response times referenced as typically “2–3 hours max,” and sometimes immediate.

------------------------------------------------------------
21) Miscellaneous explicit references (kept verbatim)
- Several numerical and example references were preserved (verbatim):
  - Inventory / weight on order = **1,063,145 lb**.

------------------------------------------------------------
CONCERNS, RISKS & LIMITATIONS (explicitly stated)
- Duplication of the database in another environment was explicitly tied to system slowness.
- Lack of SQL admin permissions and delayed port information were explicitly impeding troubleshooting.
- Inventory cleanup had not yet reconciled on‑order weight; the on‑order weight still “reflects the same.”
- Lack of batch‑processing capability for PO finalisation was explicitly stated; previous nightly automation had been in use via scripts/programs outside Power BI.
- Imported supplier files (KISS and others) were explicitly described as sometimes containing metric/imperial mixes requiring cleanup.
- Site Docs replacement risk: management pressure to replace Site Docs while team insisted “it’s not broken” and that migration could cause loss of functionality if not demonstrated.
- UI stability issues (spinning wheel, job‑site save crash, import lockups) were explicitly noted as blocking reliable operations and requiring support tickets / service‑pack upgrades.
- Mis‑use of SP codes by new staff (SP6 vs SP10 confusion) had caused rework (three‑day correction) per transcript.
- Time capture gaps: the transcript explicitly said “40% of the hours we’re missing” and described inconsistencies between posted and actual hours.

SESSION‑STATED NEXT MEETINGS / SCHEDULES / DEADLINES (explicit)
- January budget review was mentioned in the transcript (“we’re gonna do it with the bad budget review” / “Align January budget review with current PO and inventory status”).
- Ricky planned to email the AutoHotKey provider to request link reinstatement (no date given other than “will email”).
- A meeting with Mark was planned to discuss bin locations (owner: Ricky).
- Production Planner / additional demos / training were discussed as ongoing follow‑ups; no hard dates were provided in the transcript except the January budget note.

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL OBSERVATION (verbatim‑based)
- The session covered: database duplication and SQL/server issues; inventory clean‑up and unresolved order weight totals; PO finalisation process and lack of batch options; historical automation via scripts/AutoHotKey; B2B/pricing and estimating workflows; bin/location and yard planning; paint/coating data and estimating parameters (volumes, coverage, multipliers); QC/inspection form and environmental logging requirements; shop floor Start/Stop and batch handling; and multiple technical support/upgrade actions (Service Pack, SQL restart, ticketing). All items above are direct captures of the spoken transcript; nothing beyond the transcript has been added.

If you want, I will:
- Produce a prioritized action list with only named owners and explicit deadlines as stated in the transcript, or
- Convert the action items above into a short checklist for IT, Purchasing, Inventory and Estimating teams (pick which groups).
