fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29-0
<v Ricky Horton>To identify there was areas where maybe
he needs to be cleared. Absolutely.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29-1
<v Ricky Horton>Tuesday is when we have a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31-0
<v Ricky Horton>one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/51-0
<v Ricky Horton>And uh, for that,
how long did you think the line happened?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/51-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's a few a while.
Maybe it was a lot afternoon section. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/51-2
<v Ricky Horton>two months. So we'll um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/85-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, tentative, tentative. Yeah,
because you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/85-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to make sure we kind of give
him a target of when he's here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/85-2
<v Ricky Horton>Will you send him a meeting time to join
this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/85-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it shows up on his calendar and and we
have him here for that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/88-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/128-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did I think this this whole thing got
sent out to Jimmy? Is there any,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/128-1
<v Ricky Horton>is there any times in the agenda that we
want to have Jimmy the elected components</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/128-2
<v Ricky Horton>aren't specifically requested plus so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/136-0
<v Ricky Horton>That would be the Wednesday. OK,
so this is the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/140-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/149-0
<v Ricky Horton>Important stuff here launch with like the
beginning kind of plan with the already</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/149-1
<v Ricky Horton>have the that's where it's looking.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/152-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's that? Sorry, sorry.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/160-0
<v Ricky Horton>What else? What else,
month forbid so we we need to touch base</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/160-1
<v Ricky Horton>on?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/178-0
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't see anything on work packages
and production planner for in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/178-1
<v Ricky Horton>schedule. Is that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/188-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unless I missed it and it is,
is that needed? Oh yeah, definitely.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/220-0
<v Ricky Horton>The work packages we want to touch base
on. We have it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/220-1
<v Ricky Horton>but to implement the Gantt chart system
utilizing the work package to see what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/220-2
<v Ricky Horton>next.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/232-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK. That was something. Yeah,
I just didn't see anything that anywhere</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/232-1
<v Ricky Horton>on the schedule anywhere.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/237-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know the schedule was up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/243-0
<v Ricky Horton>Big topic that you wanted or at least.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/244-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/272-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, Ricky, did you invoice us yet?
I won't do it till I leave. So no worries.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/272-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're good. Yeah, yeah, no worries.
We're we're all good. So I ain't sweating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/289-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right. Well,
why don't you go ahead and just jump</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/289-1
<v Ricky Horton>right in the first section and we'll stay
here for a little bit and I can announce</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/289-2
<v Ricky Horton>any.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/309-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it would be the duplicate praise.
Like I said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/309-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty confident that we've gotten
most of that. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/309-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's I don't know how much work that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/311-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not necessarily. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/313-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/324-0
<v Ricky Horton>The 08 What we've been doing with that
one is as we come across that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/373-0
<v Ricky Horton>And say that leads to where when we're
sending out our queues that when we catch</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/373-1
<v Ricky Horton>it. Yeah. OK, cool. If I apply, you know,
this, uh, or way to it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/373-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's obviously gonna show nothing.
So this is, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/373-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's obviously not as early.
So that's what we're just going to. Yep,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/373-4
<v Ricky Horton>finding how we've been handling it is
there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/398-0
<v Ricky Horton>A better process where there is a report
that that can be pulled for that that'll</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/398-1
<v Ricky Horton>show you all those items.
So like if you go to the drop down at the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/398-2
<v Ricky Horton>top ships, great size,
maintenance drop down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/401-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then reports.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/421-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you could filter for whatever shapes
you wanted to look at or anything and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/421-1
<v Ricky Horton>then the next when you hit make report.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/449-0
<v Ricky Horton>It sees where it's a 08 report. Yeah, OK,
some people automate that too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/449-1
<v Ricky Horton>They'll do like once a month or so.
Have it sent to somebody. Just hey,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/449-2
<v Ricky Horton>here's all the new stuff from last month.
Yeah, but yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/450-0
<v Ricky Horton>Balance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/485-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now in here as well,
I think it's the top one,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/485-1
<v Ricky Horton>the size list that would give you a
listing of all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/485-2
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't show you the exceptions,
but it shows all of the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/526-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cross-sectional area,
all the the other component we were</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/526-1
<v Ricky Horton>talking that's next on there,
all of that stuff shows on that report.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/526-2
<v Ricky Horton>So some some people like just using that
report to scan down through am I missing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/526-3
<v Ricky Horton>cross-sectional area,
am I missing some flange width or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/526-4
<v Ricky Horton>anything like that on any of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/528-0
<v Ricky Horton>The any of the pieces.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/537-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do what? How easy is it? Almost too easy,
to be quite honest with you, it did.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/539-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/564-0
<v Ricky Horton>Duplicate grades or grades being added to
carving when they should have been added</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/564-1
<v Ricky Horton>to a stainless call out.
So the permissions on that have changed</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/564-2
<v Ricky Horton>in type of special.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/609-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it it is very simple to add one and
like on the imports,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/609-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can add them on the fly on the
imports and that's really kind of part of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/609-2
<v Ricky Horton>the problem is it's too easy and if
somebody's important and doesn't really</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/609-3
<v Ricky Horton>know what they're doing,
then a bunch of stuff gets added that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/609-4
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't need to get added.
So it's almost too easy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/639-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
so I ask a stupid question at the 836.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/639-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say tomorrow, let's say by 1670.
Maybe you just add all the same.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/639-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is it one at a time or can you add like?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/672-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's like for the grades. Yeah,
it it's it's just a one at a time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/672-1
<v Ricky Horton>But now you talk about adding the sizes
to the grade.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/672-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say you want an 8 by 20 piece
playing the master playing 8 by 20,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/672-3
<v Ricky Horton>but you also want 10 by.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/720-0
<v Ricky Horton>So OK,
the sizes are already in there or they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/720-1
<v Ricky Horton>they should be.
Most of the sizes are already in there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/720-2
<v Ricky Horton>but when you have like the grade,
it would apply to all of those sizes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/720-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it's only gonna be within like that
specific call out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/720-4
<v Ricky Horton>So like this one's currently selected on
channels. So if we.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/761-0
<v Ricky Horton>Add that grade to channels.
That doesn't necessarily mean it'll show</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/761-1
<v Ricky Horton>up for beams or angles. Yeah, we have to,
yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/761-2
<v Ricky Horton>you would have to go in and add it to
those ones as well. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/761-3
<v Ricky Horton>the grades are unique to the shapes.
So yes, the shapes. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/761-4
<v Ricky Horton>and you'll have a future problem I see
here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/793-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is if you do run some advanced stuff,
everything I see here is ASTM and we may</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/793-1
<v Ricky Horton>end up having ASME link. Yeah,
all of a sudden 836 with 836 initial</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/793-2
<v Ricky Horton>access 836. Yeah, it's minor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/795-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it'll make a difference.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/819-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/844-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so adding the grades are easy and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/844-1
<v Ricky Horton>actually adding shapes are easy.
If you need,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/844-2
<v Ricky Horton>if you wanted it to be a totally
different shape,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/844-3
<v Ricky Horton>I mean it's it's very customizable.
So I mean I wondered about this, just the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/848-0
<v Ricky Horton>Suck suicide, Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/849-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/858-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
the the it's still feel like the grades</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/858-1
<v Ricky Horton>are good. Cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if I only assign it to a new grade,
So what I've been doing is once I assign</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-1
<v Ricky Horton>it to like for this example,
I believe 836 is gonna be at the top.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-2
<v Ricky Horton>So the default, yeah,
I assign it to that and then I go in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-3
<v Ricky Horton>there and actually remove it from there.
Yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-4
<v Ricky Horton>remove it from the abbreviation.
From the abbreviation. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/901-5
<v Ricky Horton>it makes sense.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/902-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/905-0
<v Ricky Horton>Keep in mind that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/917-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see here what what what your
detailers?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/917-1
<v Ricky Horton>Are they using tackle structures?
I can't remember. Remind me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/949-0
<v Ricky Horton>So Miss DS, correct.
The current detailing set up is with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/949-1
<v Ricky Horton>structures. OK,
just keep in mind that when your</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/949-2
<v Ricky Horton>detailers get on structures 2025.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/988-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can share your grades and shapes and
finishes with them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/988-1
<v Ricky Horton>Have you have you guys seen that yet?
It's it was new as of 2025.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/988-2
<v Ricky Horton>What the way that functions is when you
have a Trimble Connect project linked.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1034-0
<v Ricky Horton>To this,
then you share that with the detailer.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1034-1
<v Ricky Horton>The detailer links their model to that
Trim Connect project as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1034-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that Trim Connect project is kind of
the bridge between the two packages.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1034-3
<v Ricky Horton>Then you're able to share your
Shakespeare sizes with them so that if</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1034-4
<v Ricky Horton>they.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1061-0
<v Ricky Horton>Choose a different grade than what you
have in your system.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1061-1
<v Ricky Horton>It'll flag them and they got to change it.
Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1061-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now there's just a slight amount of set
up on your side.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1061-3
<v Ricky Horton>Let me show that to you real quick. Yeah,
that's good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1128-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it'll it'll make that screen on the
import that pops up that says I don't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1128-1
<v Ricky Horton>recognize this shape or grade.
Pretty much that would be not exist in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1128-2
<v Ricky Horton>this bar which we just received the file
last week.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1128-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're we're working at Shep Steel. Yep.
And they sent us their model and we've</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1128-4
<v Ricky Horton>already had conflicting gray dimension
lengths. Yes Sir. So that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1134-0
<v Ricky Horton>That would be huge.
So we can flag it without coming through,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1134-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know? Yeah, a day and a half. Yeah,
yeah, for sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1175-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when when that happens, of course,
yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1175-1
<v Ricky Horton>detailers like to stay about 10 years
behind on their versions, I think. So,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1175-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
it might be 10 years before you get there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1175-3
<v Ricky Horton>but they don't for sure go up to
maintenance and address book.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1181-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then let's pull up one of your
detailers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1187-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they just opened there, Martin.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1235-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right,
you see in the upper right corner info</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1235-1
<v Ricky Horton>sharing.
If you hit that drop down you can you can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1235-2
<v Ricky Horton>choose to share your shapes, grade sizes,
your finishes and your ABM settings.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1235-3
<v Ricky Horton>So ABM, the ABM,
the best bill section in here is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1292-0
<v Ricky Horton>Got revamped, which was good,
it needed to be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1292-1
<v Ricky Horton>And so you're able to set up like I don't
care about any changes to the advanced</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1292-2
<v Ricky Horton>bill that is if it shrinks by two feet,
I don't care,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1292-3
<v Ricky Horton>but you can set parameters for what you
do care about so that the detailer even</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1292-4
<v Ricky Horton>then knows.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1306-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool. This shrunk by foot,
but they don't care about it because they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1306-1
<v Ricky Horton>said it's telling that.
So you can share all that with them as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1306-2
<v Ricky Horton>well. But anyhow, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1307-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
now you can talk to the teachers also.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1318-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can recycle. Yeah, yeah, it's.
I'm in the same books.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1318-1
<v Ricky Horton>It is a little little fuzzy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1327-0
<v Ricky Horton>But later they start online,
which they express them,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1327-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they just aren't you better than
online. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1362-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they can choose.
You come talking about the detail or is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1362-1
<v Ricky Horton>that what you're talking about? Yeah,
let's say they will have what you will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1362-2
<v Ricky Horton>say. Yeah, who's control?
So they can choose whichever one they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1362-3
<v Ricky Horton>want, but it will. It'll it'll flag them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1407-0
<v Ricky Horton>Saying hey, this is not theirs.
And so now I haven't gotten an answer yet</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1407-1
<v Ricky Horton>because I don't have to take structures.
So I don't know take structures.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1407-2
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't gotten an answer yet about OK,
does it completely stop them from sending</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1407-3
<v Ricky Horton>you the other stuff? I think it does.
It it stops them from sending a different</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1407-4
<v Ricky Horton>grade.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1434-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they can actually,
when they do their detailing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1434-1
<v Ricky Horton>they can detail without those shapes and
grades.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1434-2
<v Ricky Horton>But there's a there's a screen that says
here's all the ones that are wrong,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1434-3
<v Ricky Horton>got a good change on.
So but so this one takes precedence in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1434-4
<v Ricky Horton>other words, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1467-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, yeah, like like the chefs, you know,
they're controlling the detailing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1467-1
<v Ricky Horton>So therefore, yeah,
that you might have trouble with that one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1517-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have to align the shelf or do you
does it mean that to happen?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1517-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do you align your database with the shelf?
No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1517-2
<v Ricky Horton>Our database is based off of our specific
job that we do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1517-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're we're particularly like a job shop,
right? But if we do have like their model.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1521-0
<v Ricky Horton>Make it with them. Um,
then that's what we would align on that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1521-1
<v Ricky Horton>specific project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1562-0
<v Ricky Horton>So along with that connector by the way
that where you where it pulls your stuff</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1562-1
<v Ricky Horton>over that will that will give you those
submittals here as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1562-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's how that works.
So they would be when they start sending</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1562-3
<v Ricky Horton>you files.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have to e-mail it to you
anymore,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-1
<v Ricky Horton>just shows up in that list right there.
That's how that happens.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's the connector is what
it's called. So there and they got,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-3
<v Ricky Horton>they get take less some videos out there
on that so you can kind of see that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-4
<v Ricky Horton>functioning.
So you can see from the detailer's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1607-5
<v Ricky Horton>perspective.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1653-0
<v Ricky Horton>As well as your perspective,
but yet that submittals thing then will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1653-1
<v Ricky Horton>be nice because then when they send you a
package,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1653-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can pull it up and then choose to
import it straight from there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1653-3
<v Ricky Horton>But let's say that there are no drawings
in the package or something like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1653-4
<v Ricky Horton>You can reject it. It goes back,
it goes back.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-0
<v Ricky Horton>After them,
it flags them in tech structures and says</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-1
<v Ricky Horton>hey,
they rejected this one because there's no</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-2
<v Ricky Horton>draws.
So it kind of creates a log for you as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-3
<v Ricky Horton>well. That simplified communication too.
Yeah, it does. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-4
<v Ricky Horton>So pushing your detailers to go there
will make communication a whole lot nicer.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1679-5
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1681-0
<v Ricky Horton>Medium.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1682-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1684-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1691-0
<v Ricky Horton>That means finishes would have to be
cleaned too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1703-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a lot.
I wonder if you think about the so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1703-1
<v Ricky Horton>bottoms, the bottoms through your tops.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1704-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1710-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's why you're trying to adjust that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1712-0
<v Ricky Horton>We put on an 84 inch TV set up that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1740-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's because it's at an angle.
So you're either going to go to the fish</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1740-1
<v Ricky Horton>and fog clear or the not clear.
You're not even going to get all of it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1740-2
<v Ricky Horton>Will you move that,
move that down on your screen?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1761-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do you have? Do we? No. Yeah.
Why don't you just take that folder on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1761-1
<v Ricky Horton>the one in the middle of the page that
spots here and move this app like any?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1764-0
<v Ricky Horton>And zoom it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1768-0
<v Ricky Horton>A little bit more clear.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1772-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1773-0
<v Ricky Horton>Very little different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe cloud worse.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1795-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the top is not if you have a good use.
OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1795-1
<v Ricky Horton>so it's if I'm seeing the projector on
the wall, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1800-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can see how it should be hanging out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1803-0
<v Ricky Horton>Next week's problem.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1808-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, sorry.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1810-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1811-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1815-0
<v Ricky Horton>Bites to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1816-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1821-0
<v Ricky Horton>Gotta go around this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1839-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you should give it before.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1849-0
<v Ricky Horton>That would be the bottom left search bar.
Then it should get you back to fire</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1849-1
<v Ricky Horton>setting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1853-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're still.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1867-0
<v Ricky Horton>Very good. I can't read it. Oh, yeah.
Definitely. You can read that. Sweet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1867-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. I'll have it adjusted. Yeah. Yeah.
That's on the back, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1867-2
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1869-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be some video.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1902-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool. So yeah, I made the note that,
you know, once we get our detailers,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1902-1
<v Ricky Horton>you said it's the 2025. Yeah, yeah,
they'll have to be on 2025.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1902-2
<v Ricky Horton>You're already where you need to be.
They'll just have to bump up. So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1903-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1910-0
<v Ricky Horton>We've been updated for a day.
Have you for a day?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1921-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so anything new that might be missing,
please let us know. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1956-0
<v Ricky Horton>Have you noticed any or have any of your
other customers tune you into there being</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1956-1
<v Ricky Horton>any issues with this update or no there
there was on just 2025 I but first</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1956-2
<v Ricky Horton>service pack came out and fixed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1993-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks for such stuff. I would once again,
I've never knew up on the yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1993-1
<v Ricky Horton>on the personal wait for the service
first service back in that. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1993-2
<v Ricky Horton>the one thing that we noticed was there
was a a lag.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/1993-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it would come up with that then check
on not responding, but I think.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2015-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was more of our service. I don't know.
I couldn't do anything without looking</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2015-1
<v Ricky Horton>and then just literally waiting. Oh wow.
Figure it out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2048-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a, you know,
all the shops I get to,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2048-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's a wide variety of speeds.
Some are like mega slow and some are like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2048-2
<v Ricky Horton>super fast and I think it's more hardware
related than it is anything,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2048-3
<v Ricky Horton>but now anyway, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2068-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anyhow, OK,
the the the other side of the shapes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2068-1
<v Ricky Horton>great sizes was all the we we touched on
it but the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2103-0
<v Ricky Horton>Making sure all the properties are
correct for anything that gets added like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2103-1
<v Ricky Horton>the cross-sectional area and all of that
jazz because that's super critical for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2103-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimating purposes.
Without all of that then some some labor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2103-3
<v Ricky Horton>will not populate so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2117-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
go to dimensions and then just select the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2117-1
<v Ricky Horton>dimension and hit edit dimension at the
bottom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2148-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like over here cross-sectional area
depth follow that all of that jazz is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2148-1
<v Ricky Horton>critical to estimating because like as an
example cross-sectional area there is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2148-2
<v Ricky Horton>used to populate the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2186-0
<v Ricky Horton>Time for cutting in estimating,
unless something's been changed in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2186-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimate set up in here,
but out-of-the-box without anything in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2186-2
<v Ricky Horton>cross-sectional area,
you get nothing flange width that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2186-3
<v Ricky Horton>know it's not very often you don't be
adding. It's not like you're adding a new.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2219-0
<v Ricky Horton>Beam size or anything.
That's like a real rare occurrence.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2219-1
<v Ricky Horton>But in this particular case,
if you didn't have flange width,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2219-2
<v Ricky Horton>you put a coat on something and
estimating you get no coat because it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2219-3
<v Ricky Horton>actually looks at how far across the
flange is to in order to do the burn.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2269-0
<v Ricky Horton>So these are actually very critical.
I went for years and years and didn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2269-1
<v Ricky Horton>fill out any of that except for the
weight, cause I was like, who cares?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2269-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then my brother,
the head estimator at the shop I was at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2269-3
<v Ricky Horton>called me one day and was like,
why do I not have cut on a bunch of these</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2269-4
<v Ricky Horton>things? And it's like, oh crap, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2304-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so it's kind of critical all that gets</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2304-1
<v Ricky Horton>filled out as well.
So do so do we need to go through the the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2304-2
<v Ricky Horton>column sizes and populate values in in
this section they should be for for like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2304-3
<v Ricky Horton>beans you you know what the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2345-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think New Koryamanu added three jumbo
bean sizes last year or something like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2345-1
<v Ricky Horton>that.
But you know you're not adding beans like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2345-2
<v Ricky Horton>hardly ever, so they're probably fine.
But like flat bar tends to get added</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2345-3
<v Ricky Horton>quite, you know,
like 1/2 size or something and so those</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2345-4
<v Ricky Horton>are pretty.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2371-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those can be pretty critical. So yeah,
you'll just have to flip through and look</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2371-1
<v Ricky Horton>like this. Really.
I'm assuming it's not a legitimate size.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2371-2
<v Ricky Horton>I got added on an import or something
that were the detail and sent you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2371-3
<v Ricky Horton>something crappy or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2372-0
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2376-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there we go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2423-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is this something that we did? Yeah,
we we have been going through. Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2423-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's one of those active um like I was
saying in the beginning where if if it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2423-2
<v Ricky Horton>showed up when we're sending our queues
that every zero we attached to it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2423-3
<v Ricky Horton>we know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2472-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool.
We need to go back in there and figure</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2472-1
<v Ricky Horton>out, you know, all of this.
So once you have the values in here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2472-2
<v Ricky Horton>where is the math that says with these
values to calculate the cut time is so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2472-3
<v Ricky Horton>you can measure that and figure out where
you need to to, you know, adjust.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2496-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
So that's up in maintenance and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2496-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimating, OK.
And then it's over in the labor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2496-2
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance and labor standards at the
very bottom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2535-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK. So then like here,
like if you went to channel or something,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2535-1
<v Ricky Horton>select on one of those,
you'll see a cut there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2535-2
<v Ricky Horton>see the cut there is 1.66 minutes.
So is and I think what you're asking is,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2535-3
<v Ricky Horton>is that something we need to set or is
that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2577-0
<v Ricky Horton>Already a three set.
So if a sizes gets added,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2577-1
<v Ricky Horton>which by the way you can see that first
size we were looking at for channel is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2577-2
<v Ricky Horton>not showing up here.
So if a size gets added,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2577-3
<v Ricky Horton>it doesn't necessarily get added to
estimating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2626-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I think the reason they do that is
because it's like for one thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2626-1
<v Ricky Horton>you might get a bunch of crap in
estimating because you know you you do an</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2626-2
<v Ricky Horton>import from a detailer.
Sometimes they send you a bunch of crappy</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2626-3
<v Ricky Horton>sizes that aren't legit, right?
The other thing is they're not going to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2626-4
<v Ricky Horton>guess at what times you want on it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2677-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we could go here though and down at
the bottom we say add and we can add any</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2677-1
<v Ricky Horton>new channels that are not here,
but they are in the Shakespeare size</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2677-2
<v Ricky Horton>database.
So and then when it brings that in,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2677-3
<v Ricky Horton>it will populate with tons,
but you're basically getting notification.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2677-4
<v Ricky Horton>Here's what I'm adding time to so you'll
know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2709-0
<v Ricky Horton>To change it. So.
So these are Tekla times, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2709-1
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla said. Power back said.
These are the times are defaults.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2709-2
<v Ricky Horton>I would imagine that Lone row has their
own table for their times for every</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2709-3
<v Ricky Horton>operation. You may have changed these.
Sure, but yeah, we could.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2713-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're you're the master of that domain.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2750-0
<v Ricky Horton>I always see the portion of that.
So you say, hey,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2750-1
<v Ricky Horton>you gotta C6 is 2 minutes. Yeah,
so this has the original database the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2750-2
<v Ricky Horton>tech will put in and then upon our review,
if there's anything that uh may be out of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2750-3
<v Ricky Horton>the north and I need more processing time,
that's when we'll go ahead and change it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2789-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when there's updates and one of the
first things that I was seeing when I</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2789-1
<v Ricky Horton>came in is we were hitting pretty much
all of the all the other areas etcetera</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2789-2
<v Ricky Horton>and and it depends on memory you're doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2821-0
<v Ricky Horton>The cycle time from where you're coming
to to where you're going.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2821-1
<v Ricky Horton>So there's a big barrier.
But we we could see that the handling was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2821-2
<v Ricky Horton>it was we were we were constantly losing
or not getting our hours, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2821-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's when we went back in and we
asked.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2860-0
<v Ricky Horton>Application are estimating recon to
change the values on the estimates.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2860-1
<v Ricky Horton>They they manage it in Gilbert.
It's not managed here. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2860-2
<v Ricky Horton>it should be managed here.
It's managed here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2860-3
<v Ricky Horton>but that we they have to be updated and
informed that we've made that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2888-0
<v Ricky Horton>That change. OK,
so you guys are telling them, hey,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2888-1
<v Ricky Horton>this number's wrong. Yeah,
we're giving them constant feedback on on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2888-2
<v Ricky Horton>their not that strong, but that we can.
Yeah, we are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2912-0
<v Ricky Horton>But we have basically we we do a on on
like we have when we go over on over $500</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2912-1
<v Ricky Horton>we have our we put a self-imposed what
car.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2936-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's yeah, you can see I must do it.
It'll be able to restore it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2936-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's gonna have a internal way to may
have what's measured instead of you get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2936-2
<v Ricky Horton>it stating when you update that it does
not go to the estimated so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2971-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. If we update the these numbers here,
they're using tech with the estimate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2971-1
<v Ricky Horton>then yes, it's. Oh, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All your tech is all linked between here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2971-2
<v Ricky Horton>and and, right? Yes. OK, yeah,
we're all on the same thing. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2971-3
<v Ricky Horton>definitely at a base. Hey,
when we talk about estimator,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2971-4
<v Ricky Horton>that's kind of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2979-0
<v Ricky Horton>Talk, right. OK,
I see the low part Isaac and Isaac,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/2979-1
<v Ricky Horton>Isaac as well.
So it's good estimators over there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3012-0
<v Ricky Horton>Goal is going to be a lot of spot checks
and time studies on certain projects.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3012-1
<v Ricky Horton>We we need to get a certain data set for
each set up and then make adjustments.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3012-2
<v Ricky Horton>But there's a lot, yeah, to do. I mean,
it's it's intense, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3056-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean you can have all the different
shapes up there and then every one of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3056-1
<v Ricky Horton>those can have you know 20 different
dimensions if not you know hundreds more</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3056-2
<v Ricky Horton>if we did the first one and then the
fifth one and then like the 15th one and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3056-3
<v Ricky Horton>we can see some correlation.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3088-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we can just run scale on it and just
scale along. So yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3088-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can use that global edit to do it
based off the cross-sectional. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3088-2
<v Ricky Horton>theoretically based off the
cross-sectional area,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3088-3
<v Ricky Horton>you do one and it should be good for
everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3088-4
<v Ricky Horton>But I found that I had to do it in like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3149-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like the shop where I was at,
I I measured like a how long would it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3149-1
<v Ricky Horton>take to do a 14 or 22, right?
And then when I passed that to every room,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3149-2
<v Ricky Horton>it seemed like it was good for maybe 12
and 14 inch,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3149-3
<v Ricky Horton>but then 1618 inch I needed to do another
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3149-4
<v Ricky Horton>So it was like I had to do it in two inch
eager.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3163-0
<v Ricky Horton>Permits in in order to make it somewhat
easier.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3163-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we should probably do you get brought
up and pick some every so a while and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3163-2
<v Ricky Horton>update those and then hopefully it will
be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3193-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's like,
but it's like add the comments, sure,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3193-1
<v Ricky Horton>because I would find the reason to spot
check those numbers. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3193-2
<v Ricky Horton>on those shapes.
Have you guys done any time studies at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3193-3
<v Ricky Horton>this point or yeah, but so I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3238-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have a border here,
but we we obviously we we touch stains</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3238-1
<v Ricky Horton>every once in a while,
but not as much as we touch carbon, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3238-2
<v Ricky Horton>We have the the shades,
grays obviously for for the metric in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3238-3
<v Ricky Horton>there for stains,
stainless materials as well, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3268-0
<v Ricky Horton>Standards is all gonna be s s to signify
stainless and then whatever the shape is,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3268-1
<v Ricky Horton>so like this one would be played. OK,
so if we were just gonna cut,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3268-2
<v Ricky Horton>let's just say 1/2 inch.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3288-0
<v Ricky Horton>316 settings play and we were gonna cut
strips of the app for some reason and say</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3288-1
<v Ricky Horton>two by two squares. How? How would that?
How would that look here?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3290-0
<v Ricky Horton>Play tap games.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3325-0
<v Ricky Horton>316 you talking about for the time? Yes,
yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3325-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we'd have to go back to estimating the
maintenance, estimating labor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3325-2
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance and labor standards. Oh,
this might be some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3366-0
<v Ricky Horton>There might be some you might need to add
me and see the yes it's not in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3366-1
<v Ricky Horton>So any shape that you're going to use in
estimating will need to be added in here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3366-2
<v Ricky Horton>in order to get times for it.
So so with that being said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3366-3
<v Ricky Horton>if I'm adding it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3407-0
<v Ricky Horton>From a higher databases,
they're already pointing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3407-1
<v Ricky Horton>If I tell it to add the stainless steel
like for example,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3407-2
<v Ricky Horton>it will pull all of the information for
all the dimensions and everything like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3407-3
<v Ricky Horton>that. Yes. OK,
so you wanna do one real quick? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3407-4
<v Ricky Horton>just to add.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3409-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and choose it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3458-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
Then you can pull over whichever ones you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3458-1
<v Ricky Horton>want. So cool.
So this is where we could potentially do</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3458-2
<v Ricky Horton>one size. But yeah, yeah,
I don't know why why you would,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3458-3
<v Ricky Horton>unless there's just sizes that truly
aren't legitimate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3458-4
<v Ricky Horton>But then that's something you need to
clean up anyway, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3467-0
<v Ricky Horton>So shape,
right size and differentiate between type</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3467-1
<v Ricky Horton>304 and type 316 stands.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3512-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know it's when you have your database
of all your materials that are possible</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3512-1
<v Ricky Horton>and for steel you know you got this,
this and this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3512-2
<v Ricky Horton>But for stainless you got like type 304
and type 316 or different types of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3512-3
<v Ricky Horton>stainless. But the question is does your.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3560-0
<v Ricky Horton>Database currently have differentiation
in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3560-1
<v Ricky Horton>When you go to look it up and you choose,
that's the type 3 or type 316. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3560-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can select the grade. OK,
but does the grade change the like the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3560-3
<v Ricky Horton>weight at all? Doesn't change the weight,
no. Hold on a second. I got three.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3560-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's changed. Yeah, so you put it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3592-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's probably a little easier to to cut
through the portal so that then that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3592-1
<v Ricky Horton>would be the time to be right here.
But it's not. I'm not talking about. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3592-2
<v Ricky Horton>those are all they 316 doesn't process,
for example. Yeah, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3627-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, but hold on a second. Why do you care?
I can see in the material grades you want</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3627-1
<v Ricky Horton>316, three or four,
but in the labor grades,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3627-2
<v Ricky Horton>labor grades should make any different
scenario because you're going to pay more</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3627-3
<v Ricky Horton>money.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3660-0
<v Ricky Horton>I get, I get the general side of it,
but I think I say it seems the material</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3660-1
<v Ricky Horton>grade, but this is the labor thing. Yeah,
you say the labor is not looking at a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3660-2
<v Ricky Horton>grade. So yeah, we're not expected to.
Yeah, it's it's not right. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3689-0
<v Ricky Horton>But now the way you had it before where
stainless was a grade of the basically</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3689-1
<v Ricky Horton>the carbon basically Pl.
and then you you're picking whether it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3720-0
<v Ricky Horton>836 or whether it's three or four that
made a big difference for estimating</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3720-1
<v Ricky Horton>purposes.
So switching to stateless having its own</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3720-2
<v Ricky Horton>shape is big because labor is vastly
different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3747-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now, now that we brought that in though,
you can see that the times are not</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3747-1
<v Ricky Horton>populated. So what what you got to do,
then you got to populate the time we can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3747-2
<v Ricky Horton>pull that over from like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3773-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just regular Pl.
So you got something in there and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3773-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can adjust appropriately from there
if you want to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3773-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's probably the the best way to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3781-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like we can get a plate there and then
choose to pass it over so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3786-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we just pick whatever size.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3795-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
Then go up to the drop down and global</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3795-1
<v Ricky Horton>edit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3800-0
<v Ricky Horton>Global edit operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3841-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then choose to send it.
You're going to send it to the SSPL.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3841-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'll we'll make Pl.
because I'm assuming Pl.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3841-2
<v Ricky Horton>is already populated.
So we're we're saying we're going to send</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3841-3
<v Ricky Horton>it to stainless plate all those sizes.
So hit OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3876-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then this is all the labor.
So push all of it over or it'll say send</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3876-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything over there,
hit OK and now it's updating it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3876-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now it's using what's called an
extrapolation factor in order to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3876-3
<v Ricky Horton>What that means is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-0
<v Ricky Horton>That extrapolation factor is what makes
the time grow or shrink.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-1
<v Ricky Horton>The extrapolation factor could be a
cross-sectional area,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-2
<v Ricky Horton>it could be the length,
it could be the weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's whatever you've chosen to do in the
system.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-4
<v Ricky Horton>And so say at well and cuts going to be
different here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3923-5
<v Ricky Horton>but if something's done by the length
then pull.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3967-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's using whatever the standard length
is in order to make that grow or shrink.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3967-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's in other words,
you're not going to be at the same time</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3967-2
<v Ricky Horton>on one inch piece of stainless plate as
you are on 1/8 stainless plate because</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3967-3
<v Ricky Horton>the extrapolation factor looks at the
properties of it to make a grow or shrink</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3967-4
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3997-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now we should have times in the
statements plate now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3997-1
<v Ricky Horton>So is it is it run statements at .
31 where car will be .</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3997-2
<v Ricky Horton>28 density or is it not even is it not
even understand that it it it can,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/3997-3
<v Ricky Horton>it does, it can.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4022-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it,
but that's pretty much just for the the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4022-1
<v Ricky Horton>weight of that, right?
So you're putting in the weight of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4022-2
<v Ricky Horton>piece when you put the size in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4067-0
<v Ricky Horton>So in other words,
it's not doing the conversion unless you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4067-1
<v Ricky Horton>want it to.
So like a piece of quarter inch plate is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4067-2
<v Ricky Horton>10.
2 lbs per square foot for stainless is 11.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4067-3
<v Ricky Horton>16 lbs per square foot.
We enter that or it knows that when you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4067-4
<v Ricky Horton>put in that that quarter inch plate,
then you you're putting in that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4097-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
Now there is a way to take it in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4097-1
<v Ricky Horton>initial setup.
There is a way to take the whole database</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4097-2
<v Ricky Horton>of the of the card and say convert this
and it will convert it for you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4097-3
<v Ricky Horton>That won't do that one. Yeah, I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4098-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4140-0
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so now we have time for stainless plate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4140-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now what should happen going forward?
Let let's say if you added like three</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4140-2
<v Ricky Horton>quarter inch stainless plate and you you
would still have to come back into here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4140-3
<v Ricky Horton>to get add to add that three quarter inch
so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4169-0
<v Ricky Horton>So just because we add a a shape,
random size to production,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4169-1
<v Ricky Horton>it doesn't be just added to correct,
correct.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4169-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that is that is something you got to
keep an eye on and a lot of times I'll be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4169-3
<v Ricky Horton>honest with you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4209-0
<v Ricky Horton>Estimators don't catch that.
Like if if an estimator went in and they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4209-1
<v Ricky Horton>had put in the stainless plate in an
estimate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4209-2
<v Ricky Horton>they could put it in the estimate.
But because it wasn't here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4209-3
<v Ricky Horton>there would be no time.
And a lot of times the estimators just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4209-4
<v Ricky Horton>crank it out. They're just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4257-0
<v Ricky Horton>Entering the pieces,
not really paying attention and don't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4257-1
<v Ricky Horton>notice that it's not adding all the
layers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4257-2
<v Ricky Horton>So this is something like 12 like I said
displays out of 12 meetings.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4257-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's for the that's for the standard
size.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4257-4
<v Ricky Horton>So you see up at the top we've got one of
the corners selected at the top.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4288-0
<v Ricky Horton>Quarter by 12 standard length of two foot
so that it uses that for that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4288-1
<v Ricky Horton>extrapolation. What's 1212 inches?
12 inches, yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4288-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's stainless plate that's 12 inches.
It's it's it's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4305-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can't.
It's not saying that's a that's a flat</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4305-1
<v Ricky Horton>mark. It is not saying that, OK.
It's just saying that plate when I'm</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4305-2
<v Ricky Horton>looking at it to to make my.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4356-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
to make my make that extrapolation factor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4356-1
<v Ricky Horton>work.
So say if we said that it was a it was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4356-2
<v Ricky Horton>based off of the square footage,
it has to have a starting point.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4356-3
<v Ricky Horton>So the starting point for this is 1 foot
by two foot and then when you say I'm</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4356-4
<v Ricky Horton>ordering a four foot by 8 foot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4394-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's just the starting point.
It's all it is. So like you had zero,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4394-1
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yep,
right side and all the the time it takes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4394-2
<v Ricky Horton>to work on stainless.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4414-0
<v Ricky Horton>Each one of those is a little bit longer
for stainless than it is for steals.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4414-1
<v Ricky Horton>So those will all have to be updated. Yes,
for sure, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so I would expect to then come in here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-1
<v Ricky Horton>and say, cool,
I got some times in here that might be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-2
<v Ricky Horton>proportionately right to each other,
but I want all of those to go up about</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-3
<v Ricky Horton>25% or something.
You go change that and then pass up all</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-4
<v Ricky Horton>those stable sizes.
Now I understand how the bad control guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4455-5
<v Ricky Horton>think this is all the bad control.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4474-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, it is. You said the bad word.
You said the F word. Yeah. Fortunately,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4474-1
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't have all of them. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4499-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've converted a lot of fat troll people.
One of my guys that works with me said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4499-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, well, then Jason, I think came out.
Jason was like, Jason was like, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4499-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm a recovering fat troll guy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4530-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some little different,
but it was doing this morning was rather</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4530-1
<v Ricky Horton>than this, uh, left hand corner.
It's just saying I like you said you have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4530-2
<v Ricky Horton>to. Yeah.
Keith said they're just keep a touch in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4530-3
<v Ricky Horton>their crap.
They're not even looking at the timeline.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4530-4
<v Ricky Horton>So it really needs to be picked.
So it does, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4561-0
<v Ricky Horton>That part of my job,
I've been told it's gonna be precon.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4561-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be working with your clients.
Oh I have, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4561-2
<v Ricky Horton>And the people and the issues like they
think about this, but not 100%, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4561-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
since the update it's been that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4561-4
<v Ricky Horton>typically the network disconnection or so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4563-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like that is what that technically is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4565-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it keeps working.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4572-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's two people that own this,
this building.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4577-0
<v Ricky Horton>Garbage is more of the order.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4581-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mark is more of the director.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4583-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, all right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4594-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not doing anything.
Usually after that other air it you're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4594-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're sunk anyway.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4595-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4612-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if I mentioned it or not,
so tell me shut up if I have the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4659-0
<v Ricky Horton>The permissions for this,
I know you said you adjusted permissions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4659-1
<v Ricky Horton>The the cleanest I've ever seen shapes
great sizes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4659-2
<v Ricky Horton>It was at a shop where nobody had
permission to update shapes great sizes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4659-3
<v Ricky Horton>except for admin and even the admin had
an alternate log.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4693-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that he when he was importing,
it wouldn't allow him to change anything,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4693-1
<v Ricky Horton>shapes, grade, sizes, yeah,
it's very locked and I think yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4693-2
<v Ricky Horton>I almost wonder if that's the case,
if I need to not have the function so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4693-3
<v Ricky Horton>that way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just can,
so that way it might be the important.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-1
<v Ricky Horton>Once we once we get it cleaned up better,
then the goal was to have it go down with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-2
<v Ricky Horton>one person.
But everything was quieter than the floor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and that was part of the problem.
Yeah, too many people in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-4
<v Ricky Horton>Great idea.
I've been to companies where they had</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4740-5
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4777-0
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're doing it.
Purchasing people were doing it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-1
<v Ricky Horton>Other people were doing it. Like, yeah,
15 different people had access.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-2
<v Ricky Horton>We started cleaning everything up.
Then we got about two to three weeks in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-3
<v Ricky Horton>and we realized that they were clean.
That's it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-4
<v Ricky Horton>We've got to go in and clean it up.
**** just comes. They were.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4787-5
<v Ricky Horton>So is that right? That's it.
Let's do the permissions first.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4825-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then start making better products.
Waste a lot of time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4825-1
<v Ricky Horton>You can go to one or two weeks and say
you can actually fix this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4825-2
<v Ricky Horton>We don't really.
We don't estimate utilizing software.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4825-3
<v Ricky Horton>We don't want them. Yeah, makes sense.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4862-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm used to also places that have a
library,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4862-1
<v Ricky Horton>a dictionary that tells you how to name
stuff. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4862-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think that Tecla does it in the Tecla
way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4862-3
<v Ricky Horton>I assume everybody follows the Tecla way,
even though I'm against.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4892-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm used to plating 36.
I'm not used to a 36 plate and so the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4892-1
<v Ricky Horton>technical way is a material range first,
right? No, no, that's plating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4892-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's always shade. Always plating. OK,
some companies do it the other way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4930-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that may be that may be the case with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4930-1
<v Ricky Horton>tech structures. And yeah,
you would think tech structures and tech</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4930-2
<v Ricky Horton>the power plant would be one in the same,
but they're not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4930-3
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody's wanted them to do that for
forever and they just never have.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4931-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4940-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is everybody going on water?
Does anybody do anything? All good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4941-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4970-0
<v Ricky Horton>You got money. Is that you? You got money.
I know money. Yeah. So money.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4970-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to think of his last name.
But yeah, I know money. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4970-2
<v Ricky Horton>I hear he's the he's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4974-0
<v Ricky Horton>He he knows what he's doing. Yeah, yeah,
he's a good guy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4992-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think that with all the shapes that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/4992-1
<v Ricky Horton>added, this is probably gonna need to be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5028-0
<v Ricky Horton>Fixed up as well.
If we are fixing grades or shapes or any</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5028-1
<v Ricky Horton>of those in like shapes and size of
maintenance,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5028-2
<v Ricky Horton>is that updated in test 3 or do we have
to then go back and do the same task</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5028-3
<v Ricky Horton>essentially?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5063-0
<v Ricky Horton>Update like if we remove a grade or we
remove a dimension like we realized like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5063-1
<v Ricky Horton>that one was, yeah, not a a size, right?
So if we remove that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5063-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it was at some point added to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5091-0
<v Ricky Horton>The estimating do we need to then also
remove it from there or to say if it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5091-1
<v Ricky Horton>updated in just the shape and size,
is it updated? So if you add a a shape or?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5118-0
<v Ricky Horton>Turn on a shade,
kind like you did with the stainless,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5118-1
<v Ricky Horton>then it needs to be added here.
Grades will automatically get added</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5118-2
<v Ricky Horton>because it doesn't really affect the
labor side of it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5118-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's just you can utilize it within the
estimate and I understand that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5165-0
<v Ricky Horton>But we don't have all of it filled out
like the plan should or whatever, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5165-1
<v Ricky Horton>And we if we update the way they are
going to update it in estimating, no.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5165-2
<v Ricky Horton>So let's let's take it. Well,
it depends on what it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5165-3
<v Ricky Horton>Let me let me rephrase that.
It depends on what it is. So like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5212-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say for instance,
the flange width that gets used whenever,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5212-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's say some an estimator is putting in
a beam in an estimate and then there's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5212-2
<v Ricky Horton>the coats field and he goes and puts 2
coats on it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5212-3
<v Ricky Horton>At that point in time it says cool,
let me go see what the flange width is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5251-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then it's going to figure how much
burden time it has.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5251-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it will that gets updated.
But if let's say the cross-sectional area</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5251-2
<v Ricky Horton>is not in there and then you come in here
and you put in labor standards.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5291-0
<v Ricky Horton>And add that size in the labor standards.
That cross-sectional area is at that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5291-1
<v Ricky Horton>point in time used to populate the labor
standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5291-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you then go back later and put in
the cross-sectional area in Shakespeare</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5291-3
<v Ricky Horton>sizes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5315-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not going to come back in and change
the time here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5315-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it it it depends on where it is,
which I know that can be frustrating</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5315-2
<v Ricky Horton>maybe, but but yeah, if you if you add.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5317-0
<v Ricky Horton>The.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5363-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say a plan you with,
don't worry about updating anything and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5363-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimating. You do cross-sectional area.
Yeah, you need to go change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5363-2
<v Ricky Horton>You need to go at that time. OK,
so it updates some, but not yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5363-3
<v Ricky Horton>and and it's just because of the way that
it functions in the background.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5394-0
<v Ricky Horton>When it adds that time for like the the
coats,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5394-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's happening at the point that I that I
that I do it in the estimate whereas with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5394-2
<v Ricky Horton>when it adds the time for for cutting
based off a cross-sectional area it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5423-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a field in here and that field only
gets updated when I put it in here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5423-1
<v Ricky Horton>so it's not going to go update it later.
So does it warn?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5423-2
<v Ricky Horton>You said it warns you for the lights.
There was that one report for for no</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5423-3
<v Ricky Horton>weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5473-0
<v Ricky Horton>But what if there's no labor?
Is there a warning there's no labor? No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5473-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, you see it,
you can see it for sure,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5473-2
<v Ricky Horton>but there's it's not going to jump up and
down and smack you in the face.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5473-3
<v Ricky Horton>And in in actually what happens more
times than not is not that there's no</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5473-4
<v Ricky Horton>labor, but there's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5506-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some labor.
So standard labor in your shop. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5506-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah. But you know,
it's not going to tell you if, hey,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5506-2
<v Ricky Horton>you don't have cut time,
but but I do have handling time, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5506-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's not going to show you so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5532-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it don't pick up a portion of it at
all. It really needs to be gone through.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5532-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, as well. Yeah.
So here is critical to get it all the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5532-2
<v Ricky Horton>time. So yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5583-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because like that stainless plate,
if I had put a hole in that stainless,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5583-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's say I put stainless plate in an
estimate, I would get no time for cutting,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5583-2
<v Ricky Horton>handling, fed up, laying out.
But let's say I put a hole in it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5600-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would still have time for the whole
because it goes to a different part of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5600-1
<v Ricky Horton>the database to pull that.
It's not necessarily dependent on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5600-2
<v Ricky Horton>shapes, pretty sizes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5605-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's pretty mature here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5636-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the estimators come in today too.
They'll they'll build in. They'll have.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5636-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
there's you have it laid out so that they,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5636-2
<v Ricky Horton>like, the second-half of the day. Yeah,
I just wondered.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5646-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just just to make sure everybody
understands to like click on the hit hit</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5646-1
<v Ricky Horton>add down at the bottom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5663-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then do FB is the one that let's do
flat bar.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5663-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's the one that happens all the time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5711-0
<v Ricky Horton>With what I'm about to show you now hit
OK, OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5711-1
<v Ricky Horton>so right there it's saying there's no
flat bar sizes that exist in the system</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5711-2
<v Ricky Horton>that are not in the estimate,
but you'll you'll find that from time to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5711-3
<v Ricky Horton>time as sizes get added and whatnot.
So like try try it on Pl.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5714-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's let's add Pl. again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5752-0
<v Ricky Horton>So those right there are sizes that are
in shapes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5752-1
<v Ricky Horton>grade sizes that are not in the estimate.
Now I doubt very seriously you're gonna</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5752-2
<v Ricky Horton>add 25 inch plate to the estimate, right?
But like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5776-0
<v Ricky Horton>One and three sixteens. I mean,
you're not really buying that nice,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5776-1
<v Ricky Horton>but 10 gauge, 11 gauge, 10 gauge,
16 gauge, 18 gauge. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5776-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's not considered playing, but yeah,
I'm cheap.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5780-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's the kind of thing you got to
kind of watch for.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5788-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying it doesn't mean sheet.
I'm used to seeing. Yeah, I have to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5825-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you'll notice that it did add times
in for those that we just added sometimes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5825-1
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, cut time,
you'll get piece times you're handling</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5825-2
<v Ricky Horton>with plate. With plate,
the cutting comes from a burn function,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5825-3
<v Ricky Horton>so it's it's not gonna come on that line
item breakable.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5827-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5845-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, any anytime a size gets added,
make sure all the properties are there</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5845-1
<v Ricky Horton>and then it's so why is that operation
not in there?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5895-0
<v Ricky Horton>What the burn?
It's a it's a separate area.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5895-1
<v Ricky Horton>So there's a in in what's called labor
code.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5895-2
<v Ricky Horton>The labor code tells it says look at the
width of the length of it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5895-3
<v Ricky Horton>then go to a burn table that's separate
from this right here to go get your burn</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5895-4
<v Ricky Horton>rate and then it figures the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5940-0
<v Ricky Horton>It is in the system already, the permit,
just like the whole was for a thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5940-1
<v Ricky Horton>correct? Yeah. Is that how roll will work?
Go look at a table for rolling.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5940-2
<v Ricky Horton>Rolling doesn't look at a table,
but there's other ways to put it in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5940-3
<v Ricky Horton>The background of the estimate you can
get a lot of your time will come from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5940-4
<v Ricky Horton>these.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5975-0
<v Ricky Horton>Standards here,
but then some of your time will come from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5975-1
<v Ricky Horton>a Weld table, a burn table, a drill table,
and then there's also what's called like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5975-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate extras,
where you can create a formula to add</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/5975-3
<v Ricky Horton>time into into.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6014-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
So it's it's not like there's one set</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6014-1
<v Ricky Horton>place that all the labor comes from.
It could be multiple places.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6014-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's it's very dynamic,
which is it's difficult when you're first</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6014-3
<v Ricky Horton>learning the system.
But what's great about it is it's very,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6014-4
<v Ricky Horton>very customizable, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6015-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6016-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6017-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6043-0
<v Ricky Horton>Any good on that? What's TSP guys?
I assume seal.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6043-1
<v Ricky Horton>But why do you guys use tube steel and
HSSS? Yeah, good question.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6043-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think you are, are you?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6074-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Another place I work,
they got me to see. Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6074-1
<v Ricky Horton>they just called the HSS. Me too. Yeah.
Yeah. So it's not activated. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6074-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we quit the HSS, right? Yeah.
So we have to use, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6095-0
<v Ricky Horton>But eventually you're going to vaporize
those or not like you're regular or you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6095-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't care with it not being activated.
They're not accurate. It's that matter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6095-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it won't pull up to right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6146-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to say any don't care,
but let's say I'm going to just be silly</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6146-1
<v Ricky Horton>here.
You get something from Shuff and Shuff</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6146-2
<v Ricky Horton>decides they want to use TS. They use TS.
I'm not saying they do because they don't,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6146-3
<v Ricky Horton>but they use TS and you don't have it
activated and all of a sudden.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6175-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're going to get.
I don't know what would happen actually,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6175-1
<v Ricky Horton>because you're probably estimating
straight from their tables. From that one,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6175-2
<v Ricky Horton>since it's a labor take off only,
it would we're just putting in well</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6175-3
<v Ricky Horton>parameters or cut parameters at that
point.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6219-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would stop and ask if if it if TS were
coming in,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6219-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's gonna say what do you want this
to be? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6219-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now you could actually set it up to where
if it saw TS,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6219-3
<v Ricky Horton>it would actually just change it to HSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6222-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that'd be a good idea.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6258-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not the import questions.
If it recognizes a that's or doesn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6258-1
<v Ricky Horton>recognize a that we use or it doesn't
recognize when the shape nor the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6258-2
<v Ricky Horton>dimension it called and all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6284-0
<v Ricky Horton>For for us to update it and then once we
update it to whatever we do use, um,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6284-1
<v Ricky Horton>then it asks if we wanna make this like a
permanent change so that it it recognizes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6284-2
<v Ricky Horton>it for everyone. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6317-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you guys report it like once a day,
once a week, once a month?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6317-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's for every hour.
So it depends how much workflow we get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6317-2
<v Ricky Horton>from the Gilbert office.
It could be several times a day or.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6317-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you want this to be really efficient,
right? Yes, yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6353-0
<v Ricky Horton>I hope so. Uh, I can see that.
I'd like to see you doing this constantly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6353-1
<v Ricky Horton>Every job is important. So yeah, anytime.
Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6353-2
<v Ricky Horton>I see it's easy with Gilbert 'cause
you're on the same database,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6353-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it seems harder if you're getting it
from all these other.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6394-0
<v Ricky Horton>Customers, yeah,
we we typically tend to have our,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6394-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
if we get a package and we we send it to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6394-2
<v Ricky Horton>our detailer, correct.
That's a mix bag like for the shop</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6394-3
<v Ricky Horton>contact,
the TSMC that we just got last week,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6394-4
<v Ricky Horton>we asked them if they could do a a IFC
model export that would.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6420-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can correlate tests with the models,
so if we can request them to change it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6420-1
<v Ricky Horton>before, then we're looking good,
but if not,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6420-2
<v Ricky Horton>then we're going with their criterias and
we're either battling it or reporting it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6420-3
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6423-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to look at.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6425-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, seriously.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6436-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do we have to get through before,
Ron, before Estimating joins? What? When?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6436-1
<v Ricky Horton>When they join?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6444-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, what was that?
Somebody said that the meeting's gonna</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6444-1
<v Ricky Horton>join at sometime.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6468-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know we're gonna get feedback from
Jared. Do you know that one?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6468-1
<v Ricky Horton>But you don't know if there's anybody,
so like not running this for the estimate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6503-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just wondering what we have to cover
for. I'll ask 1000 questions. Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6503-1
<v Ricky Horton>because I I think you're good on shakes,
great sizes really, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6503-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's a really we're kind of down into the
estimating part of today's agenda.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6543-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which we kind of started touching on a
little bit with bringing in the stainless</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6543-1
<v Ricky Horton>and everything over there.
Do we need to I think we can get get into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6543-2
<v Ricky Horton>it.
I know they have a lot of critical</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6543-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimates to do today,
but there's a few things that we already</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6543-4
<v Ricky Horton>know we got to have the cross section
dimensions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6569-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some of the integrators are added,
but I don't want to jump into that now</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6569-1
<v Ricky Horton>unless anyone has the new kickback. Do it.
Are are you? Are you wanting? Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6569-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're talking about jumping into
estimates? Is that what you're saying? OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6569-3
<v Ricky Horton>there's something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6570-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6610-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, as far as like that first point,
estimating aluminum stainless shapes and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6610-1
<v Ricky Horton>sizes set up,
that's kind of what we did a minute and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6610-2
<v Ricky Horton>never in that stainless plate and that's
going to have to be done for all of those</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6610-3
<v Ricky Horton>shapes.
I don't know if we want to go ahead and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6610-4
<v Ricky Horton>do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6622-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
is this a we need we wanna do session or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6622-1
<v Ricky Horton>is this a we'll talk about it and and
that's your homework thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6623-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6625-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6658-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the way we can hear.
So far on some of this stuff. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6658-1
<v Ricky Horton>we've got a personnel change and we're
actually not doing anything. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6658-2
<v Ricky Horton>So as much as we can get done while
you're president, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6658-3
<v Ricky Horton>it makes me feel very good.
Then let's do it. I like. I like to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6659-0
<v Ricky Horton>It needs to be done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6689-0
<v Ricky Horton>And correct me if I'm wrong,
but I want to see where the keeper is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6689-1
<v Ricky Horton>over this location of tech web and then
you hear you know Mark and Gavin and and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6689-2
<v Ricky Horton>Alan will update estimating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6721-0
<v Ricky Horton>Teach them and train them when they need
it. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6721-1
<v Ricky Horton>And they're like utilizing our software
that we own. Yeah. And that's, that's,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6721-2
<v Ricky Horton>you've had a couple of conversations with
that over the ones they're estimating our</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6721-3
<v Ricky Horton>shop, not the other way around.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6770-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes. So and they are not. They're so busy.
Yeah, that they just can't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6770-1
<v Ricky Horton>They can't all join and participate in.
But sometimes it seems like we just don't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6770-2
<v Ricky Horton>care. Well, yeah, I'm,
I'm glad you have the, the, the,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6770-3
<v Ricky Horton>the thought process. This is our time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6810-0
<v Ricky Horton>In other words,
what I'm hearing is it needs to be the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6810-1
<v Ricky Horton>actual time.
So many estimators are like they don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6810-2
<v Ricky Horton>They could care less about actual time.
They're more like I want the hours to be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6810-3
<v Ricky Horton>here because I know I can sell it.
They're looking for selling hours rather</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6810-4
<v Ricky Horton>than they're looking for actual hours,
which is to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6852-0
<v Ricky Horton>Incredibly wrong.
So that's the way 90% of the escalators</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6852-1
<v Ricky Horton>have to do with the ability to believe it
or not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6852-2
<v Ricky Horton>So especially our thought is if we own it
and then they're utilizing it to do their</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6852-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimates,
we feel comfortable with their estimates</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6852-4
<v Ricky Horton>where now Mark is looking over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6880-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everything,
every line is going through and it's just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6880-1
<v Ricky Horton>not efficient. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I agree. So you do a Tecla review, Mark,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6880-2
<v Ricky Horton>where you do a heavy bid review. No,
I do Tecla review.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6880-3
<v Ricky Horton>I request to be brought in with heavy,
heavy bid,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6880-4
<v Ricky Horton>but they dump Tecla in the heavy bid.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6882-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
we're porting for the guess at that point.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6887-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, so let's add some then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6915-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I guess I got a question too like on
this right here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6915-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do we need to get more sizes in for
stainless angle before updating</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6915-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimating? You know what I'm saying?
So like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6917-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6922-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's start with.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6927-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need to get some in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6964-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's not a way to import like
Ryerson's book. You you can import. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6964-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean with the Chris, they I would be.
So that's what I'm looking at right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6964-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's a way to the difference will be
the weight, right? So that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6988-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's been a while since I've had it
converted.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6988-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's stupid is the stainless angle will
run the same pounds per foot that has</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6988-2
<v Ricky Horton>parts,
but stainless plate has a different count</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/6988-3
<v Ricky Horton>per square foot than the carbon footing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7018-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, I don't actually take it. So .
19 lbs per foot for both departments.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7018-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's the dumbest thing ever.
That's the way Ryerson sell it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7018-2
<v Ricky Horton>I did not realize that. Huh.
I knew there was a slight difference in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7018-3
<v Ricky Horton>the in the way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7021-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7023-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7059-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what we can do,
we can't export the angle from here from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7059-1
<v Ricky Horton>the L and then reimported this SSA
because the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7085-0
<v Ricky Horton>For samples,
like we can't do that with the shape.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7085-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we're saying Alan was if we export the
angle for target then you can just change</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7085-2
<v Ricky Horton>the grade and if we import that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7103-0
<v Ricky Horton>So go to the I if you go to the drop down
and go to export export to ASCII the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7103-1
<v Ricky Horton>other top one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7108-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then get rid of everything.
Just pull angle over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7111-0
<v Ricky Horton>And save it wherever you want.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7141-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool. Go open that up.
What we're going to do,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7141-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to find and replace.
We're going to say find L and replace it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7141-2
<v Ricky Horton>with SSL is what we're going to do in
that text file that it exported.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7160-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you're telling me once I have it in
text,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7160-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can manipulate it any which way I want?
Yep. Oh, I can even do a lot with that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7160-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7183-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so now obviously we don't want to take</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7183-1
<v Ricky Horton>all the LS and change it to SSL, but um,
so go to edit and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7185-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then replace.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7193-0
<v Ricky Horton>And find L replace SSL.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7201-0
<v Ricky Horton>And what I would do is just hit the down
arrow cause.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7218-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't want to do that.
We don't want to do the next one, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7218-1
<v Ricky Horton>You're just going to get down to where
shapes included is the next one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7221-0
<v Ricky Horton>Keep on going.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7226-0
<v Ricky Horton>There now hit replace.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7251-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I'd probably replace the rest of them.
Yeah, say that again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7251-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to think if there's going to
be an L anywhere else. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7251-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can probably do replace all after
that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7282-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shoot, it did it even up top,
but it's not gonna matter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7282-1
<v Ricky Horton>Those are just comments. Yeah,
they're just comments.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7282-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're not gonna really matter.
But see where it says shapes included.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7282-3
<v Ricky Horton>Do fix that and and change the shape
there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7285-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there we go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7294-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think we should be good. Otherwise,
can you scroll down this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7304-0
<v Ricky Horton>All the way down. Yeah,
I don't think you'll be able to get those</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7304-1
<v Ricky Horton>angles. They don't exist.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7320-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, 1212138,
that'd be interesting to try to find.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7329-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think that exists that would be
my 70.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7341-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not staying the same one,
but it's been so long that I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7344-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7353-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just save that and close it and then
we'll import that back in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7389-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you used to operating at this level
of what he just showed you?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7389-1
<v Ricky Horton>Just normal for you?
Just go to the drop down at the top of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7389-2
<v Ricky Horton>the end shapes, great size and then go.
Oh no, you do need to get a file,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7389-3
<v Ricky Horton>file and import.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7393-0
<v Ricky Horton>And Scroll down in that list.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7400-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shapes great sizes, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7431-0
<v Ricky Horton>In this case, we want to choose the SSL.
Is it a pending or overriding? It is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7431-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's going to ask us on a few
that are in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7431-2
<v Ricky Horton>They don't want to ask us on those.
It would kick some out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everything.
It's not a floating point value, is that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7441-0
<v Ricky Horton>Huh. Like, yeah, I didn't like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7444-0
<v Ricky Horton>2-3, but all of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7468-0
<v Ricky Horton>What are being point bag? No, go up to.
Let's get a shape maintenance and make</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7468-1
<v Ricky Horton>sure that the stainless and the and the
angle are set up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7470-0
<v Ricky Horton>Identically.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7498-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and then the number of variables I didn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7498-1
<v Ricky Horton>want is different than the number of
variables we sent it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7498-2
<v Ricky Horton>something's different about it.
So go to the drop down at the top and go</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7498-3
<v Ricky Horton>to shape maintenance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7505-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can probably export both of them
apparently.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7508-0
<v Ricky Horton>With inches.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7517-0
<v Ricky Horton>See if, uh, see the stainless angle.
Let's see if that's the same.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7534-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, the property is different.
Hit dimension format properties about the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7534-1
<v Ricky Horton>middle of the page here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7545-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go on down and yeah, there you go.
So three and six, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7566-0
<v Ricky Horton>So angle was just 6 unit weight,
cross-sectional area and K distance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7566-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I think that might be the problem.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7571-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, so how do we fix it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7585-0
<v Ricky Horton>So which one has the K distance?
The angle? The carbon? Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7585-1
<v Ricky Horton>But do you want the K in sandals?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7604-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you using SSL somewhere in the system
right now or has it just been set up?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7604-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know if it's being used in production
or anything?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7614-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go up to the drop down at the top Shape
Maintenance drop down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7617-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, well, close this then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7659-0
<v Ricky Horton>And go down to SSL here.
You're gonna try to make it a sense. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7659-1
<v Ricky Horton>what I'm gonna look at,
there's no way to change it after it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7659-2
<v Ricky Horton>been set up.
So what I'm gonna look at is if it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7659-3
<v Ricky Horton>being used anywhere.
If it's not being used anywhere,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7659-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's gonna be an easy thing just to leave
it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7678-0
<v Ricky Horton>And do it over again.
So go to the drop down at the top.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7678-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now shape grade size maintenance show
where the selected dimension grade is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7678-2
<v Ricky Horton>used.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7686-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, it's in inventory,
inventory history too, so it's being used.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7687-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7697-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, not a lot of times.
You buy all of this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7700-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7701-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7703-0
<v Ricky Horton>We could.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7709-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that a real job? The AZR?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7712-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is it closed? Yeah. What is?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7717-0
<v Ricky Horton>We think how we could do this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7731-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, boy, boy. Yeah,
cuz we can't change those properties</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7731-1
<v Ricky Horton>after the fact on the piece. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7732-0
<v Ricky Horton>See.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7740-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably doesn't make any difference,
probably on white.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7777-0
<v Ricky Horton>I want to say what we're currently
working on in this job would be outside</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7777-1
<v Ricky Horton>of tech planning is because we're being
and now we're adding all of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7777-2
<v Ricky Horton>mechanical sewage on tracking.
So I mean we might be OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7777-3
<v Ricky Horton>we'll just do it again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7784-0
<v Ricky Horton>If this is not only showing, yeah,
that's uh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7795-0
<v Ricky Horton>That would be a deleting of it, though,
in order to get back in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7795-1
<v Ricky Horton>That was sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7801-0
<v Ricky Horton>So here here would be the option. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7802-0
<v Ricky Horton>The.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7824-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't change it and you have to get
all the sizes in there manually or we try</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7824-1
<v Ricky Horton>to manipulate the text file somehow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7846-0
<v Ricky Horton>To get that property out of there,
what's the repercussion? Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7846-1
<v Ricky Horton>if it wouldn't be in the job,
you wouldn't have record of what you did,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7846-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know it wouldn't cost.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7865-0
<v Ricky Horton>The cost wouldn't show you if I purchased
it, it'd be completely gone to you. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7865-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I was here.
So after that it was no purchase,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7865-2
<v Ricky Horton>it just wouldn't show you cost.
Your vendor might not get paid.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7912-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we add the correct one and then this
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7912-1
<v Ricky Horton>So then we're not do you change the name
of the one that you have currently exact</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7912-2
<v Ricky Horton>to a bogus name and then create a new one?
You could, yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7912-3
<v Ricky Horton>like changing SSA or something like that
and then we set up SSAL and then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7946-0
<v Ricky Horton>All stuff would still be in there for the
job and already purchased it for it and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7946-1
<v Ricky Horton>then you got going forward and everybody
would use SSL and put SSA as not. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7946-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, we could do it that way. Yeah.
Now you know, I'm,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7946-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm guessing that that's the the issue
too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7969-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it probably is,
but I'm guessing that's it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7969-1
<v Ricky Horton>We could walk through this and then try
important and not work. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7969-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I believe that's probably the issue.
We wanted to pull the case and stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7970-0
<v Ricky Horton>Start.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7973-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many do you guys watch?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7983-0
<v Ricky Horton>They do.
I'm trying to think where the system</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7983-1
<v Ricky Horton>actually uses it. Really,
if we want to close now,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7983-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're paying it off through our.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/7994-0
<v Ricky Horton>ACPC. So it's all current.
I'm I'm thinking that the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8035-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think it actually uses the pay
distance anywhere other than a reference.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8035-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think you might be able to use it if
you wanted to in a formula,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8035-2
<v Ricky Horton>maybe in estimating,
but that would be a custom thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8035-3
<v Ricky Horton>so it may not actually be using it at all
either right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8036-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8037-0
<v Ricky Horton>You.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8047-0
<v Ricky Horton>Site. Yeah, that's the problem. Yep, Yep.
And then is there any?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Manipulate the file so it's not looking
at that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8069-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'd have to figure out what it's not,
what it's looking at that it's tripping</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8069-2
<v Ricky Horton>out on,
and we'd have to manipulate the file to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8069-3
<v Ricky Horton>do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8072-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's your thought we might create?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8112-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why don't we create SSA and then try to
do the import to see if it OK, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8112-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then if it doesn't import,
then we know the importer isn't gonna</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8112-2
<v Ricky Horton>work anyways. Yeah,
versus trying to go in there because if</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8112-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna have to manually add them
anyways, then yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8112-4
<v Ricky Horton>we might as well leave SSL along. It is,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8115-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, let's try then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8116-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8138-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to get a shape, right? Yeah,
the shape maintenance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8138-1
<v Ricky Horton>What I would do is go to angle,
just go to L and then when you hit new</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8138-2
<v Ricky Horton>shape it just copies it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8140-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8160-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so it just basically copied what
angle heads. Look what it is here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8160-1
<v Ricky Horton>Angle we're going 1363136.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8192-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but the one that's highlighted is what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8192-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to choose,
which has that property of shoot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8192-2
<v Ricky Horton>We want to like,
we do want to change it to the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8192-3
<v Ricky Horton>This is what we want. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah,
this is what we want.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8219-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because this is exactly what the angle is.
So when we import it back in properties</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8219-1
<v Ricky Horton>are all be the same that just the just
the one you got selected.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8219-2
<v Ricky Horton>So like the the stainless angle was the
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8248-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think just above this one,
which is the the line that says no, yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8248-1
<v Ricky Horton>38, the second line down,
I think that's what the stainless angle</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8248-2
<v Ricky Horton>was set up as. Yeah,
three for the property, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8265-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, so that's what we want.
Just hit add shape now down at the bottom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8265-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
you got to get a description up there as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8265-2
<v Ricky Horton>well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8269-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and then just ask you. Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8276-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now let's go to change your um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8282-0
<v Ricky Horton>Change your, uh, this is the next file,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8306-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go,
go to your text file and change it from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8306-1
<v Ricky Horton>SSL to SSA and then we import. Yeah,
so will take the structure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8338-0
<v Ricky Horton>Interact with us.
If your detailer gets on Tecla Structures</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8338-1
<v Ricky Horton>2025, then yeah,
those this can be passed over to the to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8338-2
<v Ricky Horton>their database.
So would he if he uses K in his detail?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8364-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
because what's going to come across in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8364-1
<v Ricky Horton>the import will not be the K value,
but it will be the it'll be the just the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8364-2
<v Ricky Horton>size and the shape and the length,
not the K value.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8378-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you get a,
if you go to edit and replace up there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8378-1
<v Ricky Horton>then you can do it that way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8386-0
<v Ricky Horton>So let's do SSL and then change it to SSA.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8388-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8395-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you could probably replace all here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8396-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8407-0
<v Ricky Horton>This will not work for the meeting.
This will not work for the channel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8412-0
<v Ricky Horton>The white, is that what you're saying?
Dimensionally different, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it's it's almost like a like a beam is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8437-1
<v Ricky Horton>just, yeah,
the the totally different sizes. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8437-2
<v Ricky Horton>I get what you're saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8440-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it does. It was that setting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8464-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think what it was that had the K value
in there and then when the when it didn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8464-1
<v Ricky Horton>have the K value in that shape set up,
it was freaking out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8464-2
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't received it.
It's not a slot to receive it exactly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8507-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, now you let it go in.
I guess we then decide,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8507-1
<v Ricky Horton>do you want to go through changing that
job and everything from SSL to SSA? Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8507-2
<v Ricky Horton>excuse me, yeah, we can change it to SSA,
then delete SSL out, then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8513-0
<v Ricky Horton>Change SSA to SSL if we decide if we want
to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8527-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or do you just want to add the sizes as
you get them and you have to add them in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8527-1
<v Ricky Horton>the stainless as well?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8533-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cutless and purchasing and everything
done here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, that's going to be difficult.
No, not yet. We'd have to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8553-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'd have to tell it to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8555-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8568-0
<v Ricky Horton>Once we figure out if we're going to use
the SSA or not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8582-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna be difficult for you because
it's already been purchased and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8582-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything if we go changing it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8611-0
<v Ricky Horton>She's leaving,
gets it say and then going forward,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8611-1
<v Ricky Horton>just use that as I said all along.
How are you doing? We haven't set a table.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8611-2
<v Ricky Horton>I bet you don't want to do that. No,
I think you got it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8611-3
<v Ricky Horton>You need to go back to the type of
standard, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8617-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think of an easy way of changing
that one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8619-0
<v Ricky Horton>Look at some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8635-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
you guys are spending this hour and hours</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8635-1
<v Ricky Horton>with all these factors. Yeah,
I can see that it's a bunch of better.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8635-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, it's tossing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8637-0
<v Ricky Horton>What you're doing all the time, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8640-0
<v Ricky Horton>Important videos.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8645-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think that they had a secret.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8656-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's no way to change that property.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8657-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, that is very.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8668-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we were talking about.
We have that separate database, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8668-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is our old database.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8674-0
<v Ricky Horton>There is the reason why we do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8675-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8697-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we tried to add the sizes for SSL,
which is the same as single.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8697-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'll be able to use that for me because
the values are the same.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8701-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're looking to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8706-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now I'm trying to figure out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8707-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8712-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be honest with you, I think.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8734-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the easiest fix is gonna be to take
that value out of the text file and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8734-1
<v Ricky Horton>import it back into the SSL.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8744-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because it's technically not used
anywhere. It's informational purposes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8755-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see if I can reference that in
estimating real quick.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8758-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they're not perfect speeds as I mean
data.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8760-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say it again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8779-0
<v Ricky Horton>RSV's which is like construction
construction cost data as a database for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8779-1
<v Ricky Horton>labor or inspect.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8783-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's updated annually.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8799-0
<v Ricky Horton>When I got into this program this year
and a half ago at ASB and prior to that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8799-1
<v Ricky Horton>too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8805-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right back in California,
they were starting this, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8839-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was all set up for when I got there
and but they were well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8839-1
<v Ricky Horton>they had to use the party at all when I
was there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8839-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they went through the whole community
with another gentleman Ricky Soft.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8839-3
<v Ricky Horton>They sat around the entire week and but
yeah, they already had.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8842-0
<v Ricky Horton>Something in the database they were just
using.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8844-0
<v Ricky Horton>So um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8885-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see that the K I I can't even
reference the K just that's an estimated</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8885-1
<v Ricky Horton>in for a formula,
so I don't think it's really used.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8885-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'd almost pull it out of that text file
and import it in. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8885-3
<v Ricky Horton>so we'd have to figure out the where it
is in that text file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8898-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think that's going to be your easiest
solution.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8898-1
<v Ricky Horton>So let me see if I can see what the what
we're looking for here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8910-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
I'll look at 1 by 1 by 3 sixteenths maybe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8910-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I'll look at.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8914-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll look at 1 by 1 by 1/8.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8919-0
<v Ricky Horton>Gate distance is .25.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8922-0
<v Ricky Horton>There it is right there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8932-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm thinking here's here's gonna be
the fun part is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8937-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm thinking if we took that out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8946-0
<v Ricky Horton>To where it's blank,
then it's probably going to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8958-0
<v Ricky Horton>Importing and we can probably try it is 1
by 1 by 1/8 in in stainless angle right</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8958-1
<v Ricky Horton>now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8982-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the only problem would be is that there's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8982-1
<v Ricky Horton>.25 anywhere else in the in the document,
because it's going to be different for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8982-2
<v Ricky Horton>each one, you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8983-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mm.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8987-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many line items are there?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/8989-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wonderful.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9023-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, what's the easy way to edit that?
I'm wondering if we could do it in like a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9023-1
<v Ricky Horton>sequence on the line.
So it's number whatever, right? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9023-2
<v Ricky Horton>you need to hit that location on all
lines to make sure they're all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9057-0
<v Ricky Horton>The .25 is gone, right?
So you export it to Excel. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9057-1
<v Ricky Horton>you export it into Excel using the
columns as the separators.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9057-2
<v Ricky Horton>It'll throw it into Incel and you have a
position here. Then we zero that out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9057-3
<v Ricky Horton>then back into Excel, right? Yeah,
probably be the easiest way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9059-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's try it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9068-0
<v Ricky Horton>And once again, on December day,
if we take that out, it's going to work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9068-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'll we'll find out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9075-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good. Good.
That's the limited file into Excel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9092-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll put it in the comments.
It may work. I'll grab your comment.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9092-1
<v Ricky Horton>That should it should work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9095-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it will work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9120-0
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't realize we're going to be this
far in the meets of this last week.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9120-1
<v Ricky Horton>Definitely in there.
We are in the meetings. Yeah, we are. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9120-2
<v Ricky Horton>man. Yeah, but it's cool.
It's like these little guys out there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9121-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's good, I think. Good for them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9124-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9131-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good. Yeah, finished. Yeah, next.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9133-0
<v Ricky Horton>Delivers.com.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9148-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you. Yeah, that's what she.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9171-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes. Oh, OK. What are you gonna do?
You can make all zero.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9171-1
<v Ricky Horton>We want to delete it.
You can just click on the one corner and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9171-2
<v Ricky Horton>go. It's gone. You don't have to do. Yeah,
click on McKenny.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9201-0
<v Ricky Horton>At the top, the whole log.
So now the delete button. Don't do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9201-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, go on the top.
It's if you delete it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9201-2
<v Ricky Horton>it moves everything over.
So when we go back to text,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9201-3
<v Ricky Horton>we need the comments back. That's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9221-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's beyond muted. Go ahead and exit.
Save that so you keep it. You'll save.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9221-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now go to export and see if you can
export it as an asking.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9224-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can you smile?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9230-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's, uh, the tap that we would do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9237-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's a value format.
That's the level right there. CSV.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9239-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9244-0
<v Ricky Horton>Change the name so you don't provide the
other one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9283-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, that's the CSV,
but we'll be able to import CSV.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9283-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think so. What was it called before?
Text angle dot CSV.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9283-2
<v Ricky Horton>So just rename the file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9287-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just do it. Yes,
rename is denangled dot CMC.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9302-0
<v Ricky Horton>That doesn't work.
I think I I think I got Chat EBT to just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9302-1
<v Ricky Horton>remove it too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9304-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll find out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9305-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9323-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I think you need to change it.
You have a CSV file in there that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9323-1
<v Ricky Horton>need to make the text file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9340-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then don't override it.
Call it S angle wherever you want to keep</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9340-1
<v Ricky Horton>the old one just in case you want if you
want it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9352-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we'll try and develop.
It's now it's CSB angle,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9352-1
<v Ricky Horton>call it angle pass or whatever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9376-0
<v Ricky Horton>Change the name this extension or like
you you got to change, add something,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9376-1
<v Ricky Horton>something in there. There you go.
That will now you can go to CSP.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9376-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's changed CST, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9378-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is it that simple?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9380-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna warn you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9381-0
<v Ricky Horton>I actually can do the follow up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9383-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9387-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can see where it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9389-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9392-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're not there in London.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9409-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care anything you don't care.
No program right here. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9409-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's why you say with spaces,
sometimes it does care to how it should</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9409-2
<v Ricky Horton>be the deliberative.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9414-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I said.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9420-0
<v Ricky Horton>What are you doing? We want to do SSL,
right? Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9456-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, didn't like it.
I got one that I I cleaned it up in in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9456-1
<v Ricky Horton>ChatGPT and just imported it back in to
stainless angle and it seemed to work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9456-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let me make sure I've got weight and K
value or cross-sectional area.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9457-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9458-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9463-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm good right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9468-0
<v Ricky Horton>But but go ahead if you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9485-0
<v Ricky Horton>It looks like what I did here worked.
Let's confirm. Wait, go to. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9485-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can do it here. Go to the quarter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9487-0
<v Ricky Horton>4.1.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9503-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you only in the same class?
What's that? You're not working. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9503-1
<v Ricky Horton>he gave the code. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9538-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, what's that? This.
This seem to work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9538-1
<v Ricky Horton>You want me to e-mail it to you?
I I took it and cleaned it up. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9538-2
<v Ricky Horton>I had it take that out of there and I
didn't think it liked ours because it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9573-0
<v Ricky Horton>I imported back in. I mean,
look at this real quick,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9573-1
<v Ricky Horton>just make sure there's nothing that you
see that jumps out at you,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9573-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I think everything's good.
It brought all these shapes in as the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9573-3
<v Ricky Horton>weight cross-sectional area.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9623-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now I just took the default
out-of-the-box. I'm I I don't have yours,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9623-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I could probably take yours and I'm
gonna export your e-mail.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9623-2
<v Ricky Horton>I could have ChatGPT clean it up and then
send it to you. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9623-3
<v Ricky Horton>you want me to send it over to you? Yeah,
I mean, I don't know if if you've got.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9627-0
<v Ricky Horton>Different sizes that we need.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9630-0
<v Ricky Horton>Than what I had.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9635-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you need a job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9640-0
<v Ricky Horton>That and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9684-0
<v Ricky Horton>Last week, about five or six weeks,
I forget the name of the project,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9684-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I I remember,
I'm pretty sure it was you I talked to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9684-2
<v Ricky Horton>several times that we we were struggling.
You guys were struggling to meet schedule</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9684-3
<v Ricky Horton>or something and I had to keep coming out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9700-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here we worked it out. It's it's RHSCOM.
Yeah, you at fabricationis.com. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9700-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's great. Yeah, we'll see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9701-0
<v Ricky Horton>There is that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9729-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I learned a lot about the engine.
Oh, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9729-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then I didn't understand seven months
of everything, just fantastic with other.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9741-0
<v Ricky Horton>All that stuff. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9777-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the Sheffield management.
It's quite a different it chefs the about</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9777-1
<v Ricky Horton>a big chef and because just the
management is dependent on the fact that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9777-2
<v Ricky Horton>you need. Yeah, they can get products.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9779-0
<v Ricky Horton>Every single one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9797-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hello. How are you? I'm here. Oh, OK.
Yeah. We used to work quite,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9797-1
<v Ricky Horton>quite a good part. We used to. Oh, yeah,
here. Yeah. Oh, OK. And we're together.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9797-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're solving the entire.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9832-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he's only a couple guys.
I saw on the screen a few minutes ago</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9832-1
<v Ricky Horton>again named Christopher Galski.
He's still a deputy of his and his wife.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9832-2
<v Ricky Horton>I saw Stray Con on the screen. Yeah,
I believe it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9862-0
<v Ricky Horton>They should have. But yeah,
first the guys, he still works.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9862-1
<v Ricky Horton>He's one of the guys sitting there at
5:00 PM.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9862-2
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the people are from all quiet.
They're not really. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9862-3
<v Ricky Horton>I thought that was a a few Q&amp;
A with them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9862-4
<v Ricky Horton>I used to work with you that more maybe
like 12 years ago.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9864-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9865-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9908-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that was one of my maybe two years
ago. I had a interview with them just,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9908-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
to see what the weather was like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9908-2
<v Ricky Horton>And that was one of the things that I see
in their retention reviews. Basically,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9908-3
<v Ricky Horton>the people did that morning talk.
They they didn't. They wanted.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9926-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, yeah,
when they go out and do like all day and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9926-1
<v Ricky Horton>you want everybody to do that all the way
down. Yeah, I see. We parted with this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9926-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like, yeah, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9969-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is the one we were talking about
messaging back and forth. Is that the one?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9969-1
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
that's really what do you have to do on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9969-2
<v Ricky Horton>this? Honestly,
we're just filling out a AQ and A just to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9969-3
<v Ricky Horton>see if we qualify to see it. OK,
that's great.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9969-4
<v Ricky Horton>So it'll just a bunch of questions on
clients.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9985-0
<v Ricky Horton>See, you shouldn't be involved.
We're not doing. No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9985-1
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't pay my salesman pitch.
That one wasn't. It didn't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/9985-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's not comma delimited.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10017-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not commonly limited.
Maybe export it out again and send it to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10017-1
<v Ricky Horton>me and then it'll clean it.
It didn't know what to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10019-0
<v Ricky Horton>Dix 'cause I didn't see nothing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10049-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can't cut anything over 2030,
so anything over 2030 though process. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10049-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's massive, yes.
It's something we have to do this maybe</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10049-2
<v Ricky Horton>three, maybe four other.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10083-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I mean,
a company like that is going to be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10083-1
<v Ricky Horton>shopping. I can imagine that.
So who owns this? Who? Like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10083-2
<v Ricky Horton>who gives this to you in setting chase
this? This one specifically. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10083-3
<v Ricky Horton>you have to get out. Yeah, that's right.
There you go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10106-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think I think it came from. Yeah,
they'll tell us to do stuff like this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10106-1
<v Ricky Horton>sometimes if they don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-0
<v Ricky Horton>We understand.
I'm just having this chase on these</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-1
<v Ricky Horton>things.
So we're just doing the footwork right</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-2
<v Ricky Horton>now.
I'm just busy working and then then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-3
<v Ricky Horton>they'll get into the estimate part.
That's going to be shifting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-4
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I think.
That's where I think my recommendation</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10162-5
<v Ricky Horton>would be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10174-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's good. See, I wouldn't even be,
you know, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10174-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're not still still anything I would
do, but I can live with this thing. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10174-2
<v Ricky Horton>I mean.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10196-0
<v Ricky Horton>From here sometimes,
you know through background there's whole</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10196-1
<v Ricky Horton>more,
more weight problems getting this meeting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10196-2
<v Ricky Horton>You're dreaming, you know, we're,
you know we're waiting to find. So that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10217-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because we kind of looked at the same,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10217-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to have to follow along to
stop. Well, that's right. Makes no sense,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10217-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10247-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
this is taking anybody with experience,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10247-1
<v Ricky Horton>even at all to see that,
but coming from somebody with experience.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10247-2
<v Ricky Horton>But here's my experience.
I did that in my last hour,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10247-3
<v Ricky Horton>which is why they told me to found what
they said, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10251-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I told Mark,
I'm staying in my lane here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10278-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you when you said that,
that's above my name as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10278-1
<v Ricky Horton>I like chasing those kids, remember? Yeah,
but we're going to do it all in different</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10278-2
<v Ricky Horton>shops and I'll be like,
bring us some money.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10292-0
<v Ricky Horton>I will tell you the sunscreen is the sun
did 100 scales with they only had a thing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10292-1
<v Ricky Horton>I could prove.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10318-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's $40 million worth of work and
they're they're going to do it with 18,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10318-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they figured it out.
So I think you'd be surprised what you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10318-2
<v Ricky Horton>can and can do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10326-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because skids,
the pipes are not big if you integrate</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10326-1
<v Ricky Horton>them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10376-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas if you were asked to handle it
before, you couldn't even handle it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10376-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you like physically couldn't do it
with a skin.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10376-2
<v Ricky Horton>You could do it because the parts are are
manageable. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10376-3
<v Ricky Horton>I think the hard part about the skin was,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10376-4
<v Ricky Horton>we're not a tight shot and then you come
to fight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10396-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then the sample assembly offers.
So it was gonna like you do a portion and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10396-1
<v Ricky Horton>then yeah, focused, you know,
the guys in the float field are webcast,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10396-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? Correct. Yes,
they're totally like fabrication.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10396-3
<v Ricky Horton>Question of the stainless type guys, yeah,
which I think they're not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10404-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, just send it back to you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10411-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I'm trying to figure out the
other shops and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10454-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey Richard,
have you worked with Metro before? Metro?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10454-1
<v Ricky Horton>No, they're leading in fact live.
One of our thinking was our annual</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10454-2
<v Ricky Horton>training that we put in this preliminary
intro to to them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10454-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm just curious if they have reached
out to you. I haven't worked with them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10481-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you guys import? Yeah,
I I wanted to check GPT and told it to in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10481-1
<v Ricky Horton>this position zero all those out and then
I imported it back in and it works.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10481-2
<v Ricky Horton>I had theirs.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10519-0
<v Ricky Horton>Chase, you guys have,
you guys have a license here or got it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10519-1
<v Ricky Horton>all free free free.
But we're you know we're gonna bring to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10519-2
<v Ricky Horton>the question because Chase at the top,
Chase or Daniel said that's about saying</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10519-3
<v Ricky Horton>you guys use AI as much as you can.
So now we're in the case.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10533-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've been experimenting with Chad and
Todd and Gemini,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10533-1
<v Ricky Horton>and Gemini just stepped up their game.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10534-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10557-0
<v Ricky Horton>For free we use file,
but I actually get my funny questions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10557-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so you got to be real careful.
I got the paid version of ChatGPT and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10572-0
<v Ricky Horton>Works pretty well. I'm working on a.
I'm actually recording this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10572-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm working on a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10614-0
<v Ricky Horton>A that will take all of my sessions that
I can just upload them to and like in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10614-1
<v Ricky Horton>background.
Tech was got a tech assistant where you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10614-2
<v Ricky Horton>can ask a question. Yeah,
but it gives you pretty much the textbook</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10614-3
<v Ricky Horton>answers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10652-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like OK, how do I do?
If you ask me what file to use for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10652-1
<v Ricky Horton>control,
it said here's all the files I can use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10652-2
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas like I want my trainings in there
to be a what file should I use and my and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10652-3
<v Ricky Horton>I want mine to come up and say never use
a kiss file, always use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10685-0
<v Ricky Horton>EFXC file.
I think there's the reasons why.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10685-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that type stuff I'm I'm building into
an AI tool in order to get that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10685-2
<v Ricky Horton>Plus I wanted to do my reports for me as
well as at least get the base so I can.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10690-0
<v Ricky Horton>Have the majority of the work done,
maybe if we're touching up so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10714-0
<v Ricky Horton>My son went,
he has a master's in data science and a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10714-1
<v Ricky Horton>lot of that had to do with building AI
agents and so he's doing that for me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10714-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that's kind of cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10720-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, looks like this will work, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10721-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hm.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10736-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can tell you the name of a really,
really,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10736-1
<v Ricky Horton>really large fabricator in the country
now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10740-0
<v Ricky Horton>In their city last, but um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10775-0
<v Ricky Horton>They have banned AI from their whole
organization. It's like, what? Really.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10775-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they have banned it.
So it's like they're afraid people are</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10775-2
<v Ricky Horton>going to get their secrets and there's
their secrets.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10775-3
<v Ricky Horton>And there's there might be good ways of
using stuff, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10801-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they have paid in a I'm like holy cow.
They use all the free stuff all the time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10801-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's very Yeah, it's a problem.
But I had to use all three because I kept</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10801-2
<v Ricky Horton>running my questions.
I never use any other than.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10810-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many questions do you get? Handful,
right? Then you got to wait six hours,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10810-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10812-0
<v Ricky Horton>They were good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10813-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10857-0
<v Ricky Horton>By the way,
that that set up on that is not your</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10857-1
<v Ricky Horton>issue.
That was that's the way Tecla had to have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10857-2
<v Ricky Horton>a box. It wasn't to be set up.
Sorry I checked.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10857-3
<v Ricky Horton>I just checked to see that and it's it's
true that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10869-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have the K value in the
state's angle, but they do the regular so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10883-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you think though they even if it was
falling over about you? Yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10900-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that one was the easy one.
I think the rest of them, if you ever do,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10900-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's they're not as easy. Well,
if you get hit that drop right there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10947-0
<v Ricky Horton>See global edit.
I need to brush up on this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10947-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's been several years since I've used
this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10947-2
<v Ricky Horton>This is a way to convert weight in a
particular shape,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10947-3
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm thinking we can use this by
bringing in the the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10966-0
<v Ricky Horton>Feel the carbon light and then have it
converted.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10966-1
<v Ricky Horton>But I I've got to brush up on this.
It's been a while since I've used this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10966-2
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10996-0
<v Ricky Horton>Might need to figure out,
figure out how to use this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10996-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what I'm thinking is I think we can
need more to then we come in here and say</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/10996-2
<v Ricky Horton>change all these weights and it do that
math for us so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11015-0
<v Ricky Horton>As you can see, it's going from 1.9 to 5.
1 right there because of the 490 lbs per</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11015-1
<v Ricky Horton>cubic foot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11024-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe we try on one that we're not using.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11053-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're not using, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So we try to go to the density for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11053-1
<v Ricky Horton>certain applications and design and I
just say all Harmony has a .</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11053-2
<v Ricky Horton>28 and all stainless is .31.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11076-0
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't globally do it in adventure
and in SolidWorks that way,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11076-1
<v Ricky Horton>so you don't have to worry about house
per foot, house per square foot,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11076-2
<v Ricky Horton>blah blah blah blah blah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11080-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like that right there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11085-0
<v Ricky Horton>What converted? How is it converted yet?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11091-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if we got the right, yeah,
per cubic foot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11103-0
<v Ricky Horton>So put just since we're not using SSA,
just put in 400 or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11104-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11130-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then push over all of it and then
we'll hit update.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11130-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see if it changes to that.
So 1 by 1 by 1/8 should be .</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11130-2
<v Ricky Horton>651 then I'm guessing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11138-0
<v Ricky Horton>Getting the Snipping Tool like the
greatest in the world.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11141-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11171-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you're using tech now for the majority
of time,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11171-1
<v Ricky Horton>or at least it's a different program.
Have you done something?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11171-2
<v Ricky Horton>What is it that you did? Oh, OK, right.
So they're using that. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11171-3
<v Ricky Horton>to be like for the Miss Metals.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11193-0
<v Ricky Horton>They'll do that portion here, export it,
and then add that to the heavy. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11193-1
<v Ricky Horton>they were all in Colorado.
I heard when I was here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11203-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to be here supposedly today,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11207-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's not responsive.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11217-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that might have been mine.
It's I'm just saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11217-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think you should have the right
people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11229-0
<v Ricky Horton>I spoke a little bit training last week
and it might be so, especially today,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11229-1
<v Ricky Horton>just getting bad.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11232-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11266-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know they're pretty intense work around
the job for back down and now we have to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11266-1
<v Ricky Horton>get involved. I was only a very.
Is that the same one that you're talking</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11266-2
<v Ricky Horton>about? What?
What do you think you guys are doing?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11298-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're gonna give them.
My assumption is they're gonna give them</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11298-1
<v Ricky Horton>material price per section and the labor
table per section.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11298-2
<v Ricky Horton>But for Ron was leading up with the
material, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11298-3
<v Ricky Horton>And I haven't even met the guy yet,
but did they have to?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11321-0
<v Ricky Horton>Model the whole thing. Yeah,
I'm not sure what they're doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11321-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've been driving for three days.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11359-0
<v Ricky Horton>But there's no build material there.
It's all take home. Take home. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11359-1
<v Ricky Horton>the interesting thing is that somebody
put back else in us based on the same</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11359-2
<v Ricky Horton>thing.
There's this many times on this side,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11359-3
<v Ricky Horton>on this side. Yeah, yeah, there you go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11383-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's like,
but there's no take off per se. No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11383-1
<v Ricky Horton>no stick take off. So in my mind,
I was asking Jeff to make somebody here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11383-2
<v Ricky Horton>gonna model this thing and try to figure
it out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11426-0
<v Ricky Horton>So who you've been around?
Who would do this job? Who would?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11426-1
<v Ricky Horton>What do you mean? Yeah, who would?
Who would do a job like this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11426-2
<v Ricky Horton>Who are the competitors going to be? Oh,
competitors. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11426-3
<v Ricky Horton>could do a job like that. Yeah,
still could do a job like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11426-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's like a lot of people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11468-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're not even having these small shops
to do that, that's for sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11468-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what's small? Is it small? No,
this is not small.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11468-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think they have the ability here.
Small would be like T&amp;</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11468-3
<v Ricky Horton>L or something like that,
a little tiny shops would be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11499-0
<v Ricky Horton>They'll be 44, I think so.
They have a lot of the latest,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11499-1
<v Ricky Horton>greatest equipment.
They have the ability to, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11499-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're actually because they're so
automated,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11499-3
<v Ricky Horton>they're actually extremely compatible
than anything in Arizona.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11499-4
<v Ricky Horton>They they're talking to people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11504-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I want to get it done because they
really get set up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11534-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll get an update.
I think it's still about how to be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11534-1
<v Ricky Horton>another one.
We have to have an audit 'cause they're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11534-2
<v Ricky Horton>doing some processing for us. They got,
they spot free paying out the fund. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11534-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's like they're doing 7 hour time work.
It won't will be a month.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11535-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11563-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I can see you're being preserved
saying we should be touched.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11563-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna be all telling that people
have the equipment to just need this job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11563-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's true. They won't go ahead 15 minutes.
Go back to the global editing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11604-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hit the drop down for shadow. When you do,
I'll hear the same story. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11604-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't even know what the capabilities
are. They want to be there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11604-2
<v Ricky Horton>Here's what I don't understand is why all
shapes don't show up there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11604-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not positive.
I never have figured that out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11604-4
<v Ricky Horton>but they're not all shapes are there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11606-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is SSL there?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11610-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or SSPL's there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11620-0
<v Ricky Horton>See, I mean,
I don't know why they're not showing up</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11620-1
<v Ricky Horton>there, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11629-0
<v Ricky Horton>Table somewhere, yeah, I mean.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11655-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know certain shapes that have what's
called a dynamic dimension or dynamic</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11655-1
<v Ricky Horton>field in here.
It won't allow you to do it on those,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11655-2
<v Ricky Horton>but if it has a property,
I think it would but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11657-0
<v Ricky Horton>Inhale.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11665-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, we'd have to see you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11675-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we could bring over some of the other
size and see if we could change it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11687-0
<v Ricky Horton>Jorge,
I'll get you to do it without if if it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11687-1
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't show up here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11689-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11690-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11691-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11697-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to keep doing that?
Keep working now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11718-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I might as well. Yeah,
I don't think so. That's the standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11718-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we can involve all that over for SNP,
right? Yes, we do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11738-0
<v Ricky Horton>We make sure all of the sizes are read,
everything we want to move over 1st and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11738-1
<v Ricky Horton>then jump into moving over that into. Um,
that way we're jumping back and forth.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11759-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, probably. Yeah,
you're saying update all this first thing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11759-1
<v Ricky Horton>to overdestimate. Yeah,
you probably want to turn off SSA now too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11759-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? Because it's activated.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11781-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess we could actually delete it. Yeah.
Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11781-1
<v Ricky Horton>is it still not in that other job though?
As I say it's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11781-2
<v Ricky Horton>It was the whole placeholder. Oh,
that's right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11781-3
<v Ricky Horton>You'd have to get it to drop down top of
shape maintenance or you don't need it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11792-0
<v Ricky Horton>How scary. Hitting the lead in.
That is scary.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11792-1
<v Ricky Horton>Anyone want to screw it up now? Yeah,
yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11806-0
<v Ricky Horton>Channel, but we can't.
Is channel the same in stainless as it is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11806-1
<v Ricky Horton>in?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11842-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I want to say it's different in in
stainless channel different than regular</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11842-1
<v Ricky Horton>channel. Yeah. So yeah,
I don't think we can even move it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11842-2
<v Ricky Horton>What can we move? What do we need to move?
I think the angle is an easy one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11842-3
<v Ricky Horton>I think the angle.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11856-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think I might pipe should be the same</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11856-1
<v Ricky Horton>thing.
Like the weights are the weights are</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11856-2
<v Ricky Horton>based on weights. Yeah, that's true.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11894-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I think if he's got a,
it looks like there's a tool to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11894-1
<v Ricky Horton>manipulate the wave.
There's probably a way to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11894-2
<v Ricky Horton>I just don't know this program.
Let's so let's get the let's get an</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11894-3
<v Ricky Horton>import into there to get the sizes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11903-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the size of the tubing pipe is the same,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11903-1
<v Ricky Horton>just the weight would be slightly
different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11923-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
you can then go export out the sizes we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11923-1
<v Ricky Horton>want to bring over. So it's like,
if I are in there then first things.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11926-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is labor driven by weight?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11963-0
<v Ricky Horton>Could be, yeah, it's possible.
That's all I got to worry about.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11963-1
<v Ricky Horton>If it is labor, you know a wage,
you got the wrong wage, not wrong labor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11963-2
<v Ricky Horton>It could be.
The one extrapolation factors in here is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11963-3
<v Ricky Horton>by weight, weight or unit weight actually,
so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11966-0
<v Ricky Horton>It could be if you wanted it to be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11977-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now some of it may be.
I don't know what all has been changed in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11977-1
<v Ricky Horton>your.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11987-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
you want to bring overall plate to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11987-1
<v Ricky Horton>stainless plate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/11995-0
<v Ricky Horton>Always sure the way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12013-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's current.
Is the current SSPL being used?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12013-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm assuming it's being used in projects
similar, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12031-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is the weight in the in the SSPL
currently the actual stainless weight or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12031-1
<v Ricky Horton>the carbon weight?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12032-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12058-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I think what's going to happen is
what if we bring the other back in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12058-1
<v Ricky Horton>the sizes that are currently in there
will get changed to the carbon like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12086-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
I what I'm thinking of is in production</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12086-1
<v Ricky Horton>control and POS and the whole production
side of production and purchasing side of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12086-2
<v Ricky Horton>things and payable,
so very similar to use for that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12113-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep. But yeah, I mean,
they're they're saying that's used over</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12113-1
<v Ricky Horton>there. So yeah, so if we bring it in,
it's going to change it to the carbon</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12113-2
<v Ricky Horton>weight with those sizes,
which will change PAS and stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12113-3
<v Ricky Horton>Now we'll change it back.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12122-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I just want us to know that we're
gonna affect stuff over there, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12125-0
<v Ricky Horton>We good with doing that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12155-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if we reimport that,
so we exported plate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12155-1
<v Ricky Horton>we import that in the SSPL,
it'll bring in the carbon way which will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12155-2
<v Ricky Horton>change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12193-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everywhere in production, inventory,
everything, yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12193-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it'll change all of that.
But then if we change the weight back,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12193-2
<v Ricky Horton>it'll change it again on all of that as
well. So I just want to know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12193-3
<v Ricky Horton>make sure everybody understands we're
affecting that there might be some</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12193-4
<v Ricky Horton>variations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12196-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mobile change here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12200-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you just showing us, right? Yeah, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12236-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have to figure out the version rate.
Yes, we have to figure out the version,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12236-1
<v Ricky Horton>right? Is that the best path over? I mean,
it's still something more simple than</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12236-2
<v Ricky Horton>going into in creating every single one
by one. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12236-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's basically the same thing we did with
the angle. Yep, Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12269-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it'll just temporarily change some
stuff on the PO and I can see some slight</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12269-1
<v Ricky Horton>variations too, by the way,
like if our conversion is just slightly</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12269-2
<v Ricky Horton>different,
like rounding differences or something,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12269-3
<v Ricky Horton>what's currently in there, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12271-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's gotta be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12276-0
<v Ricky Horton>It is a support, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12280-0
<v Ricky Horton>You.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12292-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so steel is 490 stainless steel lens.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12300-0
<v Ricky Horton>500 fast, but you could use that factor,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12321-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually do this,
go up to the top and make sure what was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12321-1
<v Ricky Horton>SSPL one of the options of going with a
unit weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12326-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I hit Global Editor right up there a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12326-1
<v Ricky Horton>second.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12331-0
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure SSPL is in here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12337-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're talking? Yeah, OK, it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12346-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
I just want to make sure once we bring it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12346-1
<v Ricky Horton>in, we're gonna be able to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12360-0
<v Ricky Horton>You'll have to go to the text file and
change Pl. to SSPL.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12382-0
<v Ricky Horton>And hopefully we don't have any type of
conversion.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12382-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think that was just an anomaly that
with the angle where we had to get change</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12382-2
<v Ricky Horton>it so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12391-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we can probably just replace all here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12391-1
<v Ricky Horton>Should work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12393-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12401-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12408-0
<v Ricky Horton>They didn't slow though, didn't it?
That's brutal.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12420-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's this computer set? It's serving.
Oh, it's on campus here. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12420-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's next to the restroom building.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12451-0
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't even got my computer yet.
I hit him up for you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12451-1
<v Ricky Horton>He's in line and then solved.
Just so you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12451-2
<v Ricky Horton>there's database problems trying to
figure it out. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12451-3
<v Ricky Horton>I was driving in line this morning.
I I don't even know how to use this thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12451-4
<v Ricky Horton>I I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12468-0
<v Ricky Horton>Project man.
Sat through a week of training and just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12468-1
<v Ricky Horton>use it for project manager a few months.
Then I left Steve.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12492-0
<v Ricky Horton>Almost a year.
I can't believe how many fabricators are</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12492-1
<v Ricky Horton>here in Phoenix. Yeah,
it's unbelievable having to get here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12492-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think there were 87 that found about
from Arizona to Canada,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12492-3
<v Ricky Horton>kind of the slice of the country.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12539-0
<v Ricky Horton>And now that those are the ones that were
easy to find.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12539-1
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't even bother looking. Yeah,
got me there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12539-2
<v Ricky Horton>I I saw it was missing some of them,
but I started looking at the website</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12539-3
<v Ricky Horton>something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12560-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like I'm working on such structural steel
business because there's just so many</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12560-1
<v Ricky Horton>tires here.
I think I've got close to 10 clients here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12560-2
<v Ricky Horton>in Phoenix. It's or in Phoenix area,
you know, it's it's unbelievable.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12585-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, cool.
We got 22 and a quarter and 25 inch</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12585-1
<v Ricky Horton>stainless plate.
Let me know when you're doing that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12585-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna come back out here and watch
watch you fabricate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12590-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you, Brog. Everything past two inch,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12597-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can you touch the light?
Just to touch like a branch?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12607-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so do a do a use 500 up there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12625-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think it works.
It's not right though. 4 inches is 11.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12625-1
<v Ricky Horton>16 and 3/8 is 16.5.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12643-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we can manipulate that till we get
there. I think you should,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12643-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I bet it's not as linear as you think
it is, may not be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12675-0
<v Ricky Horton>11.169 but look at 3 eights it's 16.
75 so it's not linear precise.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12675-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's not a is it because of what it's
gonna are or to be off in?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12703-0
<v Ricky Horton>10.2 is money, 15.3 is money, half inch,
24. Those are absolutely right. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12703-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm used to distributing to the first
decimal place, but half inch is 266.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12736-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right,
I think you're going to end up having.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12736-1
<v Ricky Horton>What I'm going to do is everything past
two inch paperwork and then go in here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12736-2
<v Ricky Horton>and just man these in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12781-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I don't think mathematically it's
a it's not just a straight not gonna be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12781-1
<v Ricky Horton>able to calculate it. In other words,
is what you're saying. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12781-2
<v Ricky Horton>and I think that you could probably
create a little formula,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12781-3
<v Ricky Horton>do it in your text file, but I think it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12785-0
<v Ricky Horton>For this class, we'd be here first. Yeah.
Now, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12805-0
<v Ricky Horton>So do we want to at least try to update
it to this? Just go for it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12805-1
<v Ricky Horton>Then you just know that you need to
actually go in and fix it because they're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12805-2
<v Ricky Horton>wrong.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12825-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think we need somebody who's how how
good is Gavin and or any anybody here at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12825-1
<v Ricky Horton>manipulating SP text files and doing
calculations and stuff like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12827-0
<v Ricky Horton>The basic program.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12829-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure, you can write or achieve to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12835-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you say you found a a table somewhere
there?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12865-0
<v Ricky Horton>For what? For labor? No.
For the the sizes and weights and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12865-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything.
What tables did you find earlier that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12865-2
<v Ricky Horton>said? Oh, that was labor.
That was labor's labor standards. Oh, OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12865-3
<v Ricky Horton>so Rs means produces.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12899-0
<v Ricky Horton>Labor of AISC or anything you want.
I got a lot to take a bit of a piece of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12899-1
<v Ricky Horton>plate. Yeah,
they have that database and it's built to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12899-2
<v Ricky Horton>be imported into.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12915-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'd like to see that cause I I would see.
I've never seen it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12915-1
<v Ricky Horton>I go to the store chat ABT 70. Yeah,
I'm sitting here looking,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12915-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it's all behind the table.
I can't be mad.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12960-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's probably the industry standards.
I've never heard of anybody having</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12960-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything that would import directly in
here, so I'd be curious to see it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12960-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'd love to go to the table and I'll just
e-mail our speaks to see if they have it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/12960-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13013-0
<v Ricky Horton>Where did you get that 500 or whatever
per per cubic foot you just gave over</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13013-1
<v Ricky Horton>there? I just took 10.211.
16 and figured out ratio against 490.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13013-2
<v Ricky Horton>I look it up on mine since it's about 495
lbs a cubic foot or is that stainless</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13013-3
<v Ricky Horton>right? So that's what mine said too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13041-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the bath and it doesn't actually work.
Yeah, OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13041-1
<v Ricky Horton>because they did the math right there for
us. It's like, Nope, didn't work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13041-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's just type 304 is typically about 495.
They got all the the carbon stuff in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13041-3
<v Ricky Horton>there, not the stainless.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13042-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13064-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, he really likes people do it.
Department time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13064-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't really know better than people
that use tech love or valid others in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13064-2
<v Ricky Horton>department, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13070-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I can leave anything farther than too
much. First,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13070-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think you ever have to pay stables here,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13082-0
<v Ricky Horton>Nothing much. Nothing much. OK,
four to three. Oh, it's more. I leave,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13082-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know, possibly even 4 hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13112-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like the building. I don't know.
I don't know what I see. I don't see any.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13112-1
<v Ricky Horton>They don't see anything after the show.
Oh no,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13112-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying I don't know what they're
estimating. So we take everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13146-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just a BD.
They don't share the state. They don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13146-1
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have what you're going to find.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13151-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, too inch. It's not serious. Yeah,
it's almost. It's all the work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13151-1
<v Ricky Horton>I should believe that it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13170-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think I think that I need to see. Oh,
there's no mobile. I don't think so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13170-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13197-0
<v Ricky Horton>Try and see.
I think a lot of that from the shift to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13197-1
<v Ricky Horton>the management. Yeah,
that's shift to the management.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13197-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's all the other. They. Yeah,
I thought it would be OK. Who's best to?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13197-3
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13211-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, Sir. Yeah, it's. Yeah,
it's thinking about.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13211-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think I think it says selected
dimensions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13246-0
<v Ricky Horton>You working wirelessly? Yeah,
I'm not usually that's what we're doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13246-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I can see,
I'll see you all the weeks of segments</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13246-2
<v Ricky Horton>and stuff for your back.
If everybody's on tech lab and you're all</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13246-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then based on what you guys do here,
then they go away.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13267-0
<v Ricky Horton>True. That's that. For estimating. Yeah,
numbers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13267-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that's why I that's a really that you
all are that's right now. Well, I know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13289-0
<v Ricky Horton>And one of these are going to make
something else.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13289-1
<v Ricky Horton>Most companies are using spreadsheet.
That's all they use up more. Really.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13289-2
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of companies have done that,
you know, but it's a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13295-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you can get right on the same page
that one program would be ideal.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13316-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're working on this Wi-Fi.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13319-0
<v Ricky Horton>like this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13363-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's something you can ask right now.
Yeah, the right extension.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13363-1
<v Ricky Horton>If you need that, that'll help you.
That's what I'm saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13373-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think at the end of today, no,
I'm just saying for for the rest of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13373-1
<v Ricky Horton>week though, it might be beneficial.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tell me how long do you have?
How long do you know it's better?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13385-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was getting some butter,
but we're not testing positive anymore.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13385-2
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, he's got those fake ones already up.
He's ready for it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13392-0
<v Ricky Horton>My God, it's done. So cool, cool.
We did angle play.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13394-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13401-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't use tube steel, but yeah,
stainless uses stainless steel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13410-0
<v Ricky Horton>You you could change that to SSHSS if you
wanted it to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13418-0
<v Ricky Horton>Changing the shape and it'll allow you up
in shape maintenance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13419-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13427-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it just changes it everywhere.
You just change it at the top up there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13429-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13433-0
<v Ricky Horton>How nice it lets you do that, huh?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13462-0
<v Ricky Horton>One of these times we're going to run
across, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13462-1
<v Ricky Horton>one of these that it does not show up
here and I don't know how to find out why</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13462-2
<v Ricky Horton>they say SSHSS is not there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13466-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I don't know why.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13485-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe you have a patient. So I was.
Why are you talking here?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13485-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't need that talking to me
because.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13534-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't say anything. I wouldn't think so,
but I I don't. You know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13534-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you look at the help in here,
it says it talks about if it's a dynamic</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13534-2
<v Ricky Horton>like you know, like CEO in here,
you can type whatever you want for the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13534-3
<v Ricky Horton>dimension. It's completely dynamic.
It doesn't say anything. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13534-4
<v Ricky Horton>this isn't dynamic.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13555-0
<v Ricky Horton>But so you know what?
I'm going to text one of my guys and see</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13555-1
<v Ricky Horton>if he knows. I'm Jason.
It used to be at Tecla.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13555-2
<v Ricky Horton>He he might know or not Jason, but Chris.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13556-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13565-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what what we might have to do on that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13574-0
<v Ricky Horton>We probably have to change it before we
move it back.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13579-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unless we can make it show up there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13580-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13589-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see if either of my guys responds,
see if they know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13599-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13601-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13609-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. That's why.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13614-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think what we'll have to do on those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13628-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll think there's a way to force it to
show up in the converter thing over there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13637-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think we're going to have to manipulate
it before we.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13639-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, in the text.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13653-0
<v Ricky Horton>To go change it,
is that what you're saying? Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13653-1
<v Ricky Horton>if we can get it into Excel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13673-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, do a formula to change it,
put it back in that cell,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13673-1
<v Ricky Horton>save it back as a text file,
then that that could be quicker.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13674-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13680-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm seeing if I can figure that out, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13697-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because when we saved it back as a text
file before, it didn't play well, did it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13697-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see if I can do something with
that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13721-0
<v Ricky Horton>We exported to the tech file and then
added to chat GVC to update all of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13721-1
<v Ricky Horton>sizes. Yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13722-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13758-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when you when I see this on the agenda
estimating stainless and a little bit of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13758-1
<v Ricky Horton>progress, stainless was barely touched.
What's the real need this year for a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13758-2
<v Ricky Horton>little stainless?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13771-0
<v Ricky Horton>You guys in meetings?
Are you even doing it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13771-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is anybody doing it?
We do a little bit of experience,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13771-2
<v Ricky Horton>so you do a meeting, yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13777-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I mean, if it's Eric,
I mean focus is hardly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13799-0
<v Ricky Horton>We want,
we want to find that and we want to work</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13799-1
<v Ricky Horton>on this, work on this will be bad.
So we want to do it in here in this class</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13799-2
<v Ricky Horton>for each because it's going to take a
while.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13800-0
<v Ricky Horton>Next.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13805-0
<v Ricky Horton>But David, I believe so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13806-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13841-0
<v Ricky Horton>There are only two people that we have to
do this is gathering the day-to-day job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13841-1
<v Ricky Horton>So when you look at their daily capacity,
there's my new,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13841-2
<v Ricky Horton>I said get out of home for a week,
four hours and all of a week, nail camera,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13841-3
<v Ricky Horton>a bunch of it, all of it. So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13858-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because most schools today,
the best thing was great to be in here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13858-1
<v Ricky Horton>I feel very confident about that.
Much easier. It seems like that, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13858-2
<v Ricky Horton>transfer over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13895-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's good. So what do we need to change?
What's the conversion then?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13895-1
<v Ricky Horton>So like as an example,
I'm looking at 2 by 1 by 1/8 tube.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13895-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's got 2.
2 lbs per square per not square foot, 2.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13895-3
<v Ricky Horton>2 lbs per foot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13909-0
<v Ricky Horton>For the weight of carbon,
what's the conversion factor we need to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13909-1
<v Ricky Horton>get that to stainless? No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13922-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13923-0
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13925-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here we go.
They don't offer much from posting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13951-0
<v Ricky Horton>2 by 1 by 1/8,
but I can look at a different one if it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13951-1
<v Ricky Horton>easier.
Do you something like call it like 2 two</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13951-2
<v Ricky Horton>2 by 2 by 1/8, 2 by 2 by 3/16?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13978-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tube. Tube. Yeah,
three to three and a quarter. I got some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13978-1
<v Ricky Horton>OK, two, three and three quarter, I think.
Quarter. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/13978-2
<v Ricky Horton>Should I use to memorize the car?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14010-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tuba tuba quarter is going to be 6.1,
is that correct? That's what I got. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14010-1
<v Ricky Horton>hang on. Roll it out of here. Stay this.
Did you just pick one of those two? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14010-2
<v Ricky Horton>that works.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14021-0
<v Ricky Horton>Again,
I think you're gonna create a factor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14021-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not going to be a linear factor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14037-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we can check a couple of them to see.
So we can get you in the ballpark.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14037-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see. So hang on,
let's see here to the to the quarter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14075-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just got to get it converted to a way for
a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14075-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's the way I would do it because
that's we did .28 and .3 once. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14075-2
<v Ricky Horton>just did block conversions.
Yeah to the stainless way to what?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14075-3
<v Ricky Horton>What was the tuba tuba quarter?
The quarter was 6.16.4.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14087-0
<v Ricky Horton>ChatGPT. They're stainless steel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14090-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll see if you'll do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14108-0
<v Ricky Horton>You said you paid for a little ChatGPT.
Yeah, yeah, it's like 20 bucks a month,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14108-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it does.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14130-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty much, yeah.
It's unlimited what the things I the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14130-1
<v Ricky Horton>number of responses I can get and it does
a little bit better job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14133-0
<v Ricky Horton>So let's see what this looks like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14135-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14143-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's another size?
You got 3 by three by quarter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14177-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, what you got 8.953 and it did 9.
9336. What if that's linear though?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14177-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think that I think we probably got
going on what?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14181-0
<v Ricky Horton>What we were saying was it's not gonna be
linear.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14182-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14184-0
<v Ricky Horton>See here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14203-0
<v Ricky Horton>Try another one. What else you got? Well,
I'll tell you what the thing is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14203-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we went from.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14208-0
<v Ricky Horton>5.41 to 6.1.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14210-0
<v Ricky Horton>6.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14211-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14225-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's a factor of 1.
123 by three by quarter was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14228-0
<v Ricky Horton>8.81.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14267-0
<v Ricky Horton>9.93 Yeah,
it's so it it it did it what what I told</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14267-1
<v Ricky Horton>it to do,
but it's just not going to be the same</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14267-2
<v Ricky Horton>factor. So yeah, what do we?
So you want to try this one to see like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14267-3
<v Ricky Horton>the three,
what the factor would be for the threes?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14297-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so it says it should be 8.
953 for for what now?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14297-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah so well what I'm saying is if you
because it it should have been that or it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14297-2
<v Ricky Horton>was 8.81, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14299-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14317-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, 8.81.
So if we figure out the factor 4,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14317-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what do you got there? 8.1953?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14348-0
<v Ricky Horton>8.81, so that's 1.81.
I don't know about 1.12.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14348-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's completely different. Yeah,
completely different. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14348-2
<v Ricky Horton>I've seen numbers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14366-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's not somewhat,
it's not a it's wonderful. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14366-1
<v Ricky Horton>I wonder if we just bring in the carbon
then and then you're just going to change</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14366-2
<v Ricky Horton>it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14401-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think converting it at all is
going to help.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14401-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't look like at at minimum at
least it gives them a a good base to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14401-2
<v Ricky Horton>start with.
It's they have nothing in there. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14401-3
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah, I agree. It will be something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14433-0
<v Ricky Horton>But this is where we spend. I mean,
be busy doing the average that we come up</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14433-1
<v Ricky Horton>with per cubic foot weight of stainless
in there. You know it's not correct.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14433-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's supposed to be closer to the steel.
So you could start that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14442-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. We could start with one.
Basically what he's saying is start with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14442-1
<v Ricky Horton>the one that you have.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14469-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the, uh,
charging team where we did change it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14469-1
<v Ricky Horton>where I converted it. Yeah, yeah,
at least we can hear the ballpark.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14469-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then as you go along, you change it.
Whoa, like we just looked at it. Uh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14469-3
<v Ricky Horton>we write the right quarters.
It was only off by.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14512-0
<v Ricky Horton>That 100 foot, yeah, but it was,
it was that way without changing it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14512-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
but so we know it's almost one of those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14512-2
<v Ricky Horton>If we don't change it,
don't mess with the ChatGPT one that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14512-3
<v Ricky Horton>already changed because ChatGPT changed
it to like 9.3 versus the 8 point.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14550-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the two per two per quarter was a 1.
12 factor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14550-1
<v Ricky Horton>whereas three to three per quarter was a
1.03 factor. So it's vastly different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14550-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's just no it's not on the near
factor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14590-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to figure out why it's not
leading. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14590-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't understand why it's not.
So I've argued this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14590-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's the stainless bill is a big ball a
lot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14590-3
<v Ricky Horton>So they have a tolerance that they're
they want to sell you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14629-0
<v Ricky Horton>What they shipped you. Yeah,
they're trying to get their tolerance and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14629-1
<v Ricky Horton>they do pay for the maximum the maximum
they could give you,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14629-2
<v Ricky Horton>but they may sell you the minimum.
There you go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14629-3
<v Ricky Horton>I think you got some of that going,
but I never understood.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14656-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is wide angle. They didn't do that. Yeah.
And the books are all published that way,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14656-1
<v Ricky Horton>even though the numbers are wrong. Yeah.
So what we ended up doing because we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14656-2
<v Ricky Horton>fought this problem everywhere.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14665-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the design softwares we would use .31.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14703-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pounds per cubic inch for all stainless
and .</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14703-1
<v Ricky Horton>289 pounds per cubic inch for carbon and
then that made a conversion,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14703-2
<v Ricky Horton>even though we knew from a procurement
weight perspective, it wouldn't work out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14703-3
<v Ricky Horton>but for the things that we were using it
for center.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14751-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was fine. It was, yeah, it was there.
I suppose if we pick something on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14751-1
<v Ricky Horton>higher side,
it would be OK to get us to the ballpark</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14751-2
<v Ricky Horton>and we picked something on the higher
side. I would, I would do,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14751-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would do that. I think a little routine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14761-0
<v Ricky Horton>What I don't know is the ripple effects
on labor here, but I'm not so worried.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14785-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just for when you're trying to do the
labor estimating, that's a good point.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14785-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's interesting. Yeah.
Which one do you want in there for the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14785-2
<v Ricky Horton>labor side? The heavier one? Well,
the heavier one would cover your worst</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14785-3
<v Ricky Horton>case scenario, but again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14810-0
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody would have to make that call
understanding the the weaknesses of it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14810-1
<v Ricky Horton>but a lot, you know,
it's not all the labor is done by way</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14810-2
<v Ricky Horton>either, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14844-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's there's in fact it's probably
there's actually not that much labor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14844-1
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't think that would be affected
by weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14844-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's more it takes this much time to do a
cut, this much time to do a whole,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14844-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know, things like that, right? Yeah.
So I'm.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14846-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm curious about.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14878-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, like handling. Yeah,
that makes sense to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14878-1
<v Ricky Horton>But they just figured on the heavier side,
the pounds per cubic inch,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14878-2
<v Ricky Horton>cubic foot and use that the only ballpark
are the only ones that are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14882-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ball and estimators because all over
there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14938-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, you know,
they're not involved in this part of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14938-1
<v Ricky Horton>project, right?
I think what you're going to do</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14938-2
<v Ricky Horton>eventually is you're going to start with
a baseline.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14938-3
<v Ricky Horton>Baseline could be whatever it is that's
close.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14938-4
<v Ricky Horton>Eventually you're going to start saying,
oh, these numbers are ridiculous.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14971-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I don't even think it will be related.
So it'll it'll be addressed in the bid</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14971-1
<v Ricky Horton>review prior to submission.
So if they feel that your money will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/14971-2
<v Ricky Horton>arrive in a bunch of whichever it's made,
then we'll go up or down depending on.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15014-0
<v Ricky Horton>When you actually purchase something,
doesn't doesn't that information get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15014-1
<v Ricky Horton>adjusted in here somewhere?
The the weight doesn't get adjusted</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15014-2
<v Ricky Horton>unless you purposely decide to get into
it. So maybe knowing this though,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15014-3
<v Ricky Horton>we go and purchase something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15068-0
<v Ricky Horton>It should be a standard habit,
like every single time you purchase</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15068-1
<v Ricky Horton>something. OK,
we need to update the weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15068-2
<v Ricky Horton>One thing that I that I'm sorry,
that's that's one of those things where</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15068-3
<v Ricky Horton>that's what we've been doing for all of
the brands or all of the assignments that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15068-4
<v Ricky Horton>have a 0 pay.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15105-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a it's a big reminder of us. OK,
I need to go in there and see what just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15105-1
<v Ricky Horton>that.
But if there's a wait in there that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15105-2
<v Ricky Horton>almost throws it off in a sense of like
that might be correct.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15105-3
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe we have to remember just to
remember OK to be specific for everything</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15105-4
<v Ricky Horton>you get you've got to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15139-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I used to have a problem on the carbon
with various mills,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15139-1
<v Ricky Horton>tube mills having different weight per
foot for the same size.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15139-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now they're just slight differences,
but they were differences and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15172-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not like I could change it for one
PO and another PO would be different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15172-1
<v Ricky Horton>The weight is what the weight is in the
system. If we change it to a zero, though,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15172-2
<v Ricky Horton>our problem is that we're not putting in
there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15172-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's mine to update it if we are so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because they're saying from what I've
seen,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-1
<v Ricky Horton>we we tend to use a lot of the same sizes
frequently and so everybody continually,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-2
<v Ricky Horton>right,
continually using the same size and we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-3
<v Ricky Horton>constantly going back to check that one.
It's now we check it 2-3 versus</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-4
<v Ricky Horton>unnecessary.
So you recommend that when you leave it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15223-5
<v Ricky Horton>at 0, so you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15282-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or you recommend you can just pick one
and just go with it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15282-1
<v Ricky Horton>I say we either change it all to zero or
we move it to something like close for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15282-2
<v Ricky Horton>him. I think so. No,
I think in my opinion,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15282-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not the final decision maker,
but in my opinion I would just pick</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15282-4
<v Ricky Horton>something on the high side and say let's
make it all and if we do the high side.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15322-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think at that point we could just take
what you've already done with Chad GT and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15322-1
<v Ricky Horton>put it in there and then it just at least
that's probably probably your best bet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15322-2
<v Ricky Horton>Just for my opinion like that,
we'll have to finally make all the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15322-3
<v Ricky Horton>decision and all this stuff,
but I would just only want to know what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15322-4
<v Ricky Horton>the ripple is through procurement as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15327-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like I assume let's say you buy explained
soon.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15351-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you receive 6 plates or do you receive
2 sons? It'll be per piece, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15351-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't think the way it matters
because you're receiving bases, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15351-2
<v Ricky Horton>But there's some systems that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15376-0
<v Ricky Horton>Want that weight that that other thing
can be given there is when you get your</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15376-1
<v Ricky Horton>invoice.
If people actually look at the invoice</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15376-2
<v Ricky Horton>when they're when they go to payability
of this test,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15376-3
<v Ricky Horton>same place and waive X amount of balance.
If you look at what you have in your</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15376-4
<v Ricky Horton>system here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15423-0
<v Ricky Horton>The kind of, yeah,
it's like and so it was appreciate for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15423-1
<v Ricky Horton>example creating loads in tech load and
now we're trying to get that, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15423-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think you're looking at fairly,
I think you're looking at fairly minute</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15423-3
<v Ricky Horton>changes unless you're talking about
setting up one or.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15444-0
<v Ricky Horton>Truck loads of the same item, right?
It'd be still relatively close. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15444-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
do various stainless mills have different</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15444-2
<v Ricky Horton>weights per foot for the same size?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15445-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna say, I mean.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15489-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just saying for the cost of medic
grades stainless, no.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15489-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think you know Kenmac will give me what
mass gives me, gives me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15489-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's the same for what I want to do for
what I miss is when you get into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15489-3
<v Ricky Horton>different grades,
the weights again change duplex.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15521-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just comes up with either three or three,
probably going to use three or four more</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15521-1
<v Ricky Horton>than anything in the case where it's the
316.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15521-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you base both everything on three
or four,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15521-3
<v Ricky Horton>you're probably going to be your fault.
I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15521-4
<v Ricky Horton>the Ryerson book has really worked for my
entire career.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15552-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
There might be a little arguments here or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15552-1
<v Ricky Horton>there, but those numbers are.
It's funny how that book has become the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15552-2
<v Ricky Horton>the standard.
Ryerson has such a good book on that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15552-3
<v Ricky Horton>So well,
that book used to be really the new book</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15552-4
<v Ricky Horton>is shipped.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15592-0
<v Ricky Horton>I had one that was just tattered. Yeah,
I could. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15592-1
<v Ricky Horton>Any of you who speak to the number that
you had to chat to BT,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15592-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's going to be kind of the worst case
scenario. And then, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15592-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to be everything ballpark.
Yeah, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15592-4
<v Ricky Horton>at least everybody's getting that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15633-0
<v Ricky Horton>Somewhere down the road a year or two
from now, oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15633-1
<v Ricky Horton>we got this size that we haven't really
bought much of. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15633-2
<v Ricky Horton>let's take a quick peek and I'll maybe
it's the same, maybe it's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15633-3
<v Ricky Horton>And it's gonna get you at the ballpark.
It's probably better than having a 01</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15633-4
<v Ricky Horton>happen to actually enter every single one
every time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15653-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll send it back to you if that's what
you want to use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15653-1
<v Ricky Horton>We might have to check two or three other
ones just to make sure it's not out of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15653-2
<v Ricky Horton>left field or something,
but I understand what Gavin's spending on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15653-3
<v Ricky Horton>this,
trying to get this stuff fixed just hours</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15653-4
<v Ricky Horton>and hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15674-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he has time. Any,
any between with Bailey or Peter,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15674-1
<v Ricky Horton>anytime he has something.
He's our he's our major Tesla.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15693-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
we requested from the leader Gilbert to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15693-1
<v Ricky Horton>get us person here.
We don't care if it's we would prefer</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15693-2
<v Ricky Horton>someone.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15732-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's the technical experience, but if not,
we can just get somebody here that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15732-1
<v Ricky Horton>highly trained work. They can be in house,
they can get out, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15732-2
<v Ricky Horton>outsource to do this work and and we have
not the set up work is what you're saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15744-0
<v Ricky Horton>Jeff and I I talked to Jerry and Jeff
went doctor in public.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15767-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
right now we're just trying to get a list</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15767-1
<v Ricky Horton>together of all the IT issues everyone's
having and get somebody stationed here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15767-2
<v Ricky Horton>for this camera and all that stuff like
this thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you like printing? Yeah, I think,
I think. All right, 477 is, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15780-1
<v Ricky Horton>these things here are knockout drag out.
She's brawl. She would have just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15796-0
<v Ricky Horton>That thing is so quick.
And then the angle,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15796-1
<v Ricky Horton>which was not even close to that,
was the problem. Yeah, it was a bit crazy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15802-0
<v Ricky Horton>What? Wait a second. I thought we had 400.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15807-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you say you brought it all in?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15818-0
<v Ricky Horton>Bing, oh, serial.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15826-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hang on a second here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15827-0
<v Ricky Horton>The um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15833-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go to HSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15838-0
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure we didn't just change HSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15846-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's the weight on like Tuba Tuba
quarter?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15855-0
<v Ricky Horton>5.41 So can that's SQ. Yeah, the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15857-0
<v Ricky Horton>That text file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15885-0
<v Ricky Horton>Has HSS in it? Go change the SSHSS.
I know that's what I found awful weird</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15885-1
<v Ricky Horton>too.
That's why I was scared that we just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15885-2
<v Ricky Horton>changed the way to the HSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15908-0
<v Ricky Horton>This, this, this one looks like the board.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15910-0
<v Ricky Horton>If.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15953-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
So there's Jason and she Jason with what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15953-1
<v Ricky Horton>she went to.
So Jason and then I got another guy Chris</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15953-2
<v Ricky Horton>Randolph. Chris was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15957-0
<v Ricky Horton>So both of those guys work with me so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15990-0
<v Ricky Horton>Jason, you should be. Yeah,
I basically I didn't entirely because I</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15990-1
<v Ricky Horton>was in charge of all the project manager
getting involved with the estimators.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/15990-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I just sat there the full week with
him, you know, it was kind of fun.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16019-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not that I remember much.
It was like a lot of information.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16019-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll tell you what, this week, Sir,
you're you're drinking through the fire.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16019-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was spinning. Jason is so good.
He he knows the system really well and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16019-3
<v Ricky Horton>he's a true teacher.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16049-0
<v Ricky Horton>But she was very good.
It was a year and a half ago.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16049-1
<v Ricky Horton>I had to use it for the last 10 months,
probably. Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16049-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't remember everything. Yep,
I really haven't focused on, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16056-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we were doing some of the same type of
thing we're doing now. Yep,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16056-1
<v Ricky Horton>I remember going through that. Yeah,
it's OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16082-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe doing this even though I sat
through and still have never estimated,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16082-1
<v Ricky Horton>but estimating day-to-day usage of
estimating is it just to set up?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16117-0
<v Ricky Horton>I had my own structures,
so I had that control and I switched over</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16117-1
<v Ricky Horton>to that suite. Yeah,
this is now that suite that they've</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16117-2
<v Ricky Horton>converted. Yeah, yeah, this is.
So I had some experience with that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16117-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimating, but I never asked.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16158-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the estimating from Fab suite till now,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16158-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean there's been some structural
changes and some things that they've done,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16158-2
<v Ricky Horton>but the basics of it is the same as what
I was saying Fab suite.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16158-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you used it then and you wouldn't have
trouble with here, but I like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16209-0
<v Ricky Horton>I did sit down with the estimators quite
a bit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16209-1
<v Ricky Horton>I like the fact that they could make them
set up like a like they'll take 10 items</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16209-2
<v Ricky Horton>to make a call and combine them all and
say OK, this is a memorized thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16209-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
and that was pretty cool because you can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16209-4
<v Ricky Horton>do the same thing over and over and you
can set it up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16242-0
<v Ricky Horton>It up. I said ladders.
They got three dozen size ladders. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16242-1
<v Ricky Horton>I got a set up for that, you know,
you're talking about parametric</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16242-2
<v Ricky Horton>assemblage. Yeah, assemblage. Yeah,
that was really cool. I believe it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16242-3
<v Ricky Horton>It is the speedy way of doing, I think,
especially when it comes to miscellaneous,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16242-4
<v Ricky Horton>miscellaneous.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16245-0
<v Ricky Horton>So good, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16266-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm hoping that the estimators here
already know I do. Maybe they do,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16266-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you know we've gone through,
we've gone through the website.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16285-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would love to just be nothing.
I'll be on a pair of records soon for the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16285-1
<v Ricky Horton>rest of my life. I'm something.
I'll be on a pair of records soon.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16285-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're fun.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16317-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what my ChatGPD was really.
That's cool,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16317-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you kind of got to know how to build
in your retail chat to GPD out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16320-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would do it practically.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16324-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16335-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's probably not an updated bunch of
tables, probably, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16335-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I can't expect this to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16338-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really just drop right in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16339-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16349-0
<v Ricky Horton>Alright,
I'm I'm gonna drop this same file in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16352-0
<v Ricky Horton>I just started it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16360-0
<v Ricky Horton>It says successful. It wasn't that quick,
surely.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16362-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I know why.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16370-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I I did the same thing.
I didn't change the,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16370-1
<v Ricky Horton>didn't change the file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16400-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I can't hear you. So Chris,
it's running 2223 or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16400-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's running. I started it and I might.
I'm up to 100 right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16401-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16432-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I just passed you,
but now granted I'm technically working</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16432-1
<v Ricky Horton>on server, you know I'm not, yeah,
not working on a client reading through</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16432-2
<v Ricky Horton>the server,
but I've seen guys switch offices.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16452-0
<v Ricky Horton>And their speed like just it was vastly
different, but it's very,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16452-1
<v Ricky Horton>very network independent for sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16467-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's when you have a shared connection
to share versus versus the dedicated</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16467-1
<v Ricky Horton>board. Yeah,
cause all these routers have different</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16467-2
<v Ricky Horton>capabilities.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16479-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is a Wi-Fi. Yeah,
I I think you're right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16479-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think Wi-Fi is exactly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16484-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the main line.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16491-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mine,
mine just finished point of reference.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16493-0
<v Ricky Horton>Small web file.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16494-0
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16519-0
<v Ricky Horton>Stay, stay. Yeah,
I was freaking when I asked her for a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16519-1
<v Ricky Horton>while. I got it. I bought Smart Ring.
I don't know several months there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16519-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then I started to realize how little
level I actually moved. I'm like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16519-3
<v Ricky Horton>holy cow, I got that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16547-0
<v Ricky Horton>You got the ring. You got the ring.
This one even does. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16547-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't like that right in the middle of
that. Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16548-0
<v Ricky Horton>T.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16554-0
<v Ricky Horton>But he actually ignored this crashes. Oh,
it's nice.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16558-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine for nothing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16586-0
<v Ricky Horton>For example, you know,
for people to think it's, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16586-1
<v Ricky Horton>relevant to the location.
So sometimes it takes a little longer</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16586-2
<v Ricky Horton>than you certain things.
I can see that it's close to the server.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16588-0
<v Ricky Horton>For what I got.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16608-0
<v Ricky Horton>You couldn't modify the file,
so it only brings in the rest of it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16608-1
<v Ricky Horton>unless we just want to see how quick it
is that now compared to before.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16614-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's true. Oh, let's see.
Way faster.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16631-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's looking at the ones that
already now we'll get now it's adding,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16631-1
<v Ricky Horton>but that is faster than it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16656-0
<v Ricky Horton>She was speaking to us on the laptop,
just to see if the attendance would be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16656-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, 5G here. It's pretty slow.
What you guys are hearing you?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16656-2
<v Ricky Horton>Facing safe? Yeah,
I think you can see it fine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16678-0
<v Ricky Horton>I had to switch carriers, right? A PP.
Military was not here. I switched back.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16680-0
<v Ricky Horton>See.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16682-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16709-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just remember,
this is your speed to your live speed,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16709-1
<v Ricky Horton>not to your server.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16719-0
<v Ricky Horton>So does the Gilbert have to hit the
server here?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16722-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16726-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we're down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16738-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we have still in Mexico,
but we ended up doing a very sort of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16741-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which would be the same data mirrors and
going to have to worry.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16742-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16747-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they didn't start.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16749-0
<v Ricky Horton>Switch.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16755-0
<v Ricky Horton>Switch is back at their own service.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16757-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would think.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16768-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're pretty impressive.
I mean 1616 about 2 1/2.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16769-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16795-0
<v Ricky Horton>For labor,
if unless you guys have changed something</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16795-1
<v Ricky Horton>drastically, I was looking a minute ago,
I don't see very much labor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16824-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, I just looked at the state's angle.
I didn't see very much labor dependent on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16824-1
<v Ricky Horton>weight.
It was more length or cross-sectional</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16824-2
<v Ricky Horton>area, surface area.
There was very little that was dependent</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16824-3
<v Ricky Horton>on the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16826-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just strict weight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16830-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, big old tubes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16831-0
<v Ricky Horton>They are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16836-0
<v Ricky Horton>Any of this exists in the universe, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16843-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think the biggest stainless tubes I've
seen is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16846-0
<v Ricky Horton>8 by 8.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16848-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so you can probably save yourself a
bunch of time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16857-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's some of the sales?
It doesn't exist. That's not even for it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16857-1
<v Ricky Horton>It sales.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16865-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's 177 entries of maybe half of them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16890-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wonder if that's when I noticed there was
a blank one in there after we went back</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16890-1
<v Ricky Horton>in after it crashed.
I'm wondering if that was a result of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16890-2
<v Ricky Horton>crash.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16927-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
I would want to know if somebody here is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16927-1
<v Ricky Horton>messing around with really big stainless
too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16927-2
<v Ricky Horton>because it needs to flag somebody saying,
oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16927-3
<v Ricky Horton>we don't really do this and by getting
rid of it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16927-4
<v Ricky Horton>they would have to ask somebody to add it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16958-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and then you're gonna know that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16958-1
<v Ricky Horton>somebody's playing around with something
weird. I think that's their mentality.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16958-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'll try to find a way to do that.
That's fine,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16958-3
<v Ricky Horton>but I used to get all the weird stuff
that sent to me and and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16988-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then we, you know,
I had the power in my past life to decide</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16988-1
<v Ricky Horton>who didn't or not to do it. There's,
you know, see,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/16988-2
<v Ricky Horton>but there's a lot more things.
That's right. Force it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17006-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and then somebody can just say,
let's not do that. Yeah, they just do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17006-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you can't buy it.
You're gonna you physically will have to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17006-2
<v Ricky Horton>make the tube with trust break.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17018-0
<v Ricky Horton>The mill is not going to make that.
Depends on your quantity,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17018-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you're right. Oh, right.
If you want a black 400, maybe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17026-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anything's possible, I suppose. Yeah,
right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17058-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm straight to here,
but then jobs that I've never seen</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17058-1
<v Ricky Horton>stainless tube, I haven't seen any,
but stainless tube steel yet,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17058-2
<v Ricky Horton>but stainless I haven't seen.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17075-0
<v Ricky Horton>And even big beans,
we wouldn't if we if it was smaller,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17075-1
<v Ricky Horton>we just make the bean. Yeah,
it cost too much money to see that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17075-2
<v Ricky Horton>which is cost too much money to buy it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17101-0
<v Ricky Horton>How would you make it?
You just buy it until you can figure out</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17101-1
<v Ricky Horton>a plate and weld it up. Yeah, that's it.
That's it. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17101-2
<v Ricky Horton>just like you're doing out here. I mean,
the box maybe. Yeah, same thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17101-3
<v Ricky Horton>Same thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17103-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the news level.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17116-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you're not going to do thousands of
feet, like 2 or 20 footers, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17140-0
<v Ricky Horton>And when you make it,
you got to worry about the warpage and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17140-1
<v Ricky Horton>having to stop it from moving when you
weld it up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17140-2
<v Ricky Horton>And what do you do after it's made and
it's more how you going to fix it all the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17140-3
<v Ricky Horton>time?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17172-0
<v Ricky Horton>There we go.
So we have plate tube and we'll be need</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17172-1
<v Ricky Horton>to add to for savings that we need to add
to the estimate, correct? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17172-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are there any others you got to get round
pipe and and the round tubing?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17181-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, by you could use those, that's all.
Oh, you're talking about, uh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17181-1
<v Ricky Horton>agents and so on, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17212-0
<v Ricky Horton>See that I don't see it,
but it's something people do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17212-1
<v Ricky Horton>I see hand rest without inch and a half
diameter spin still treatment rather than</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17212-2
<v Ricky Horton>pipes.
I've got lots of hand rail meets the code,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17212-3
<v Ricky Horton>the tube meets the code and the pipe does
not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17223-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's only if you're going to have some
hand. It's just as.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17231-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can we duplicate this for them? She's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17272-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, different HSSR,
is that what you're saying? Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17272-1
<v Ricky Horton>just go to shape, maintenance, grab HSSR,
hit new and then we'll change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17272-2
<v Ricky Horton>We'll do SSHSSR.
We'll still have to do the export import</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17272-3
<v Ricky Horton>thing. It's only for round two.
It's not going to cover all the square</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17272-4
<v Ricky Horton>spots if you're not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17288-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're gonna take HSS on it.
We already have anything. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17288-1
<v Ricky Horton>so just do new now. Yeah, there you go.
That makes sense. And then just SSHSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17289-0
<v Ricky Horton>Please.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17340-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now I may stop at anything.
Nothing bigger than two inch.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17340-1
<v Ricky Horton>I would like maybe three or four inches
that would stop that. Yep,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17340-2
<v Ricky Horton>there is 3 inch.
You know you have a car grill,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17340-3
<v Ricky Horton>it could have a three inch top.
So then you go export HSSR shapes will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17340-4
<v Ricky Horton>change the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17360-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll change it to SHSSR or that's hard
to say and then we'll put it back in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17360-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do we want to change,
try to change the weight as well or leave</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17360-2
<v Ricky Horton>it the the carbon weight or they're not
going to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17367-0
<v Ricky Horton>I grew up to 4 inch,
like 4 inch in the middle.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17379-0
<v Ricky Horton>Get good at this import or export thing,
right? It's good practice. We should.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17398-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I would say to leave everything over four</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17398-1
<v Ricky Horton>years, right? Even the four and a half.
Yeah, I would say four is even.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17415-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I don't think I've ever done anything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17435-0
<v Ricky Horton>HSS.
What's weird is the the this exported out</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17435-1
<v Ricky Horton>with the shape of HSS.
That's really weird.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17456-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is not tubing, right?
This is follow structure inspection.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17456-1
<v Ricky Horton>It should be tubing, though.
That's what standard comes in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17492-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can call it change SSR,
but what I see here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17492-1
<v Ricky Horton>even in the bar side of it,
there's so much more tubing in this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17492-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's not really built. This is not.
I mean, this is the structural business.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17492-3
<v Ricky Horton>This is not the exchange or business.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17542-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, why is there no 2 inch? Oh,
good question. Look at that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17542-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you see that 1.9,
that's an inch and a half.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17542-2
<v Ricky Horton>I wonder if these are really five. Yeah,
that's what it looked like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17542-3
<v Ricky Horton>These are really five.
These aren't gravity.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17543-0
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17564-0
<v Ricky Horton>The the looks weird to me.
I don't know what happened.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17564-1
<v Ricky Horton>Where did you grab from? HSSR, HSSR, HSSR.
It tells me the problem could be two of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17564-2
<v Ricky Horton>these resizes that were happened.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17604-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think that is the default.
A lot of the sizes I see there look like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17604-1
<v Ricky Horton>they're pipe sizes. You know,
starting at the top,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17604-2
<v Ricky Horton>the most common one pipe size is 1.9.
That's an inch and a half pipe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17627-0
<v Ricky Horton>1.9 inches is inch and a half.
You go down 3 lines more. It's at 1.9 by .</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17627-1
<v Ricky Horton>12.
That's an inch and a half scale to 40</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17627-2
<v Ricky Horton>pipe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17631-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that is it's not it's not too good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17637-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you're missing to me, to me, to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17663-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
this that's coming from the AISC manual</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17663-1
<v Ricky Horton>in the AISC. In the AISC manual it's 1.9.
Do they not have any?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17680-0
<v Ricky Horton>For tubing sizes, round tubing sizes.
Well, this is HSS round.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17680-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's what that's coming from.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17681-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17722-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. It's not a.
We just don't even put it on.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17722-1
<v Ricky Horton>This isn't a.
This isn't like a DOM tube or something,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17722-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? This is, yeah, this is different.
Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17722-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would say we don't even have this
because this isn't gonna be helpful.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17722-4
<v Ricky Horton>Now there is a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17723-0
<v Ricky Horton>There is a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17727-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think a tube round in here. Let me look.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17753-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, there is a there is a shape,
but there's no sizes with it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17753-1
<v Ricky Horton>it looks like. So yeah, it's all too big.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17760-0
<v Ricky Horton>But what I'm seeing the way it's not in
the system, it's student, around student.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17788-0
<v Ricky Horton>They've built it for just the structural
side and any other shapes can be done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17788-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just they don't have to be built in
there. They do, they do stairs,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17788-2
<v Ricky Horton>the rails all the time and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17832-0
<v Ricky Horton>Inch and a half pipe 1.
9 over D does not meet code inch and a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17832-1
<v Ricky Horton>half OD like the ones they have up there
that does meet code inch and a half OD</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17832-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know .
188 or you know those people but I didn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17832-3
<v Ricky Horton>see it .125.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17847-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's probably the most common handrail</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17847-1
<v Ricky Horton>size that is used,
but that's odd that they have all shapes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17847-2
<v Ricky Horton>done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17877-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, that's that's Alameda.
I think I wouldn't even put that in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17877-1
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't put that in here,
but you can have it manually, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17877-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's only going to be really three or
four different sizes they're going to get.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17878-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17926-0
<v Ricky Horton>Jason was always bad about that too.
He's like, none of you don't use pipe. No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17926-1
<v Ricky Horton>you don't. You use stupid.
They changed that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17926-2
<v Ricky Horton>Unfortunately it was in my lifetime
because I started in 79 and we were still</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17926-3
<v Ricky Horton>using pipe sizes and then they changed
the handrail code.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17951-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or if it had to be that you have to leave
for the river,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17951-1
<v Ricky Horton>95% of the out there is not leaving.
Are we supposed to be looking for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17951-2
<v Ricky Horton>something? I think it's all the same.
They're all the same. So just grab one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17952-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17995-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's the driving standard for more
handrail?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17995-1
<v Ricky Horton>What do you mean when you're saying a
handrail would be a week's code is inch</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17995-2
<v Ricky Horton>and 1/2 upside down.
That's a standard for the grip part and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17995-3
<v Ricky Horton>the top rails they get 2 inch, 3 inch,
4 inch, 5 inch,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/17995-4
<v Ricky Horton>whatever they want the carb rail.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18036-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the handrail portion is inch and a
half OD and you can get away with inch</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18036-1
<v Ricky Horton>and 1/4 of pipe which is inch and 5/8 OD.
I've seen that illegal also,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18036-2
<v Ricky Horton>but nothing above that is illegial.
You can't use inch and a half pipe at one</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18036-3
<v Ricky Horton>point in time.
It has to do with the with the strength</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18036-4
<v Ricky Horton>of it as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18057-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that right?
It's not right next to here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18057-1
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas in fact, for pressure piping,
you get 850 degrees grade B.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18062-0
<v Ricky Horton>But because these handrail guys stopped.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Blasted. Oh, free blasted.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18075-0
<v Ricky Horton>It should be in here. Oh, it did. Got it.
Thank you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18098-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks. What is your? What is your?
What is your position here?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18098-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think to to go beyond structural
foundation.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18108-0
<v Ricky Horton>We were.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18116-0
<v Ricky Horton>Changed and there was a gap,
but I think they're a great song.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18126-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm concerned with other people who are
trying to replicate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18140-0
<v Ricky Horton>My real practice is to go on to something
that includes a lot of electrical tools.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18140-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the experience with handling of metalwork.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18153-0
<v Ricky Horton>What?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18156-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18164-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the back of Wyoming on subcontractors
and departments.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18167-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would say that would be,
that would be like me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18170-0
<v Ricky Horton>You ever leave?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18180-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's like, hey,
I'm talking to this fabrication work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18217-0
<v Ricky Horton>I might. If it's somebody I work with,
you need to come in the what,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18217-1
<v Ricky Horton>100 party shops, something in the US.
I'm sorry, home is been lotted. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18217-2
<v Ricky Horton>definitely. It's like a 16,
000 tons that they want by a little bit</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18217-3
<v Ricky Horton>more.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18240-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's 26 and 27th for the March.
Yeah, March of 27th. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18240-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's 8000 this March, 8000? No,
it's not a good response.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18270-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, OK.
But the problem that you really have is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18270-1
<v Ricky Horton>you've got,
they're going to give you drawings in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18270-2
<v Ricky Horton>November. They want this deal in March.
You've got to have the capacity to push</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18270-3
<v Ricky Horton>all that through in two months.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18275-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you need time to buy it,
it's time to drop the payment.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18280-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's silly. Yeah, but we'll better.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18306-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's cool about that project is it's
more on batteries. It's more energy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18306-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's funded by Bill Gates.
Take care of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18307-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably 10 something months ago.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18312-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you're honest here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18322-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's nice to like driving complete on.
Now you can hit Phoenix.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18322-1
<v Ricky Horton>Traffic starts sacking up right right
after Ridge.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18334-0
<v Ricky Horton>I live in the northeast Mesa,
so my record was still here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18334-1
<v Ricky Horton>They said it could have been here,
but would have given it as possible.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18343-0
<v Ricky Horton>The staff of the attorney is on Friday.
Well, that's very good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18348-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you Tucson to the Valley.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18349-0
<v Ricky Horton>Super.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18353-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, finally fixing that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18371-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if I can make it all the remains and
then you'll be telling me to report.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18375-0
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody always says to do high speed
training.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18379-0
<v Ricky Horton>20 years.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18390-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
there's going to be building the the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18390-1
<v Ricky Horton>island, Mexico up to wherever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18429-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe you drive at Kingdom.
I don't know if you got about two weeks</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18429-1
<v Ricky Horton>ago. I've been,
I've been working in Vegas, living here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18429-2
<v Ricky Horton>working in Vegas for the last seven
months. But yeah, I was driving.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18429-3
<v Ricky Horton>I can see how they're improving all that
to make that interesting. They are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18430-0
<v Ricky Horton>Most of the time I flew,
I grow with a few times.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18431-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know where I put that touch.
It goes to this area.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18437-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's on my.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18452-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's where you live. I actually.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18453-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm with.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18461-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's what happens when we do not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18462-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18463-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18484-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ducks. None. I don't know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18486-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18499-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like I was at shop week before
Thanksgiving that mid tanks,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18499-1
<v Ricky Horton>so definitely not as common though.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18519-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably 8085% of the shops I go to are
pretty much strictly structural or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18519-1
<v Ricky Horton>miscellaneous.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18529-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all I we used to hire.
I think the team from the environment and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18529-1
<v Ricky Horton>they know this or after all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18535-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, that's the common part of it.
Does this work with HP?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18558-0
<v Ricky Horton>You don't have to use tech of structures.
SDS is another common SDS too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18558-1
<v Ricky Horton>but really anything that I can output.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18605-0
<v Ricky Horton>The best file type here is what's called
PFXT file or PFXF firefactor exchange SDS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18605-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's basically there's a zip file with
XML.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18605-2
<v Ricky Horton>The drawings and the CNC files are in it,
but they can also import PS file, Excel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18627-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, so yeah,
if a program can output that I can get it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18627-1
<v Ricky Horton>in. So that's it.
It's almost unlimited what it can import</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18627-2
<v Ricky Horton>from as long as you get in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18629-0
<v Ricky Horton>Excel for that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18640-0
<v Ricky Horton>It does work best then with technic
structures or SDS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18674-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's pretty much electrical up in here.
It just wouldn't work because you'd have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18674-1
<v Ricky Horton>to have a home or electrical. Well,
that's the challenge in talking about the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18674-2
<v Ricky Horton>electrical.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18702-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I know that's going to be part of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18702-1
<v Ricky Horton>agenda is creating the shapes you need
and then how you're going to get every</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18702-2
<v Ricky Horton>all the data in there, right? You know,
how you're going to get that important.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18702-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's going to be the challenge.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18741-0
<v Ricky Horton>What the heck are they doing here?
No idea what electrical stuff in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18741-1
<v Ricky Horton>system. I mean whatever shape you want,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18741-2
<v Ricky Horton>And so it may not like bees in here.
It does have fields for what the fledge</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18741-3
<v Ricky Horton>width and the depth.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18772-0
<v Ricky Horton>And all that is right.
You know the electrical stuff,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18772-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's not gonna have a field for that type
stuff, right? You know, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18772-2
<v Ricky Horton>But we can create a shape with just a
description at a length or whatever and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18772-3
<v Ricky Horton>so and and can make it work. It's just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18792-0
<v Ricky Horton>How is it going to?
How do you get everything in there and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18792-1
<v Ricky Horton>how is it all going to function? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18820-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I was like, stop.
So we ended up on a steal. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18820-1
<v Ricky Horton>just that. Yeah.
And then some of the baptrol guys would</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18820-2
<v Ricky Horton>have their own little boot like copies of
baptrol and just run the system.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18851-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I think you need the right tool.
I'm not trying to force it because you're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18851-1
<v Ricky Horton>just going to pull your hair.
It pains to do that. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18851-2
<v Ricky Horton>there's another client of mine that
started doing deck.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18878-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they wanted to put the deck in here,
the manufacturing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18878-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you're you're buying coils and then
outputting lengths of deck, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18878-2
<v Ricky Horton>So system doesn't play real great with
that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18911-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we're building sheets, right? Yeah,
we basically did that. We did OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18911-1
<v Ricky Horton>here's the sheet,
although the coil is this wide and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18911-2
<v Ricky Horton>the deck is this wide too.
So you you you about had to do a nesting</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18911-3
<v Ricky Horton>thing and and it functioned,
but it was a workaround that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18925-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wasn't spot on.
It's it would be a whole lot easier to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18925-1
<v Ricky Horton>have the program that does it, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18931-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's a very good idea,
but I don't think so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18945-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, we got some out the last couple.
We had 29 different ERP systems.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18949-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we got a level set.
Everybody moved to 1.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18987-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody's pushed back. It's like, oh,
that's great,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18987-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's got one of the items, you know,
exactly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18987-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they tried migrating the biggest
business into the one. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/18987-3
<v Ricky Horton>that was huge. And they just said OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19001-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they went from 29 to 14,
got rid of some of the small ones and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19001-1
<v Ricky Horton>they were trying to get 14 down to 4.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19030-0
<v Ricky Horton>What they put us on,
they filled the business. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19030-1
<v Ricky Horton>So art was temporary parts in one year
with more than all the other companies</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19030-2
<v Ricky Horton>that were ever put in their history. Yeah,
yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19038-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because every part we were junction. Yeah,
everything we did was unique, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19061-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so they would have 6 inches of pine,
9 inches of pine. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19061-1
<v Ricky Horton>we have cobweats that are all over the
place.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19061-2
<v Ricky Horton>They wanted that in the park to eat our
pieces.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you'd never.
You'd never find it in the in the store.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19108-0
<v Ricky Horton>And years and years ago,
probably in the mid 90s,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19108-1
<v Ricky Horton>there wasn't a whole lot of good stuff
out there for structural and I kind of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19108-2
<v Ricky Horton>had to do something similar and I forced
it into just full length stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19108-3
<v Ricky Horton>I wasn't doing any remnants.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19117-0
<v Ricky Horton>And finally we then bought something that
was actually forced me off and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19125-0
<v Ricky Horton>When you got the right tool,
avoid it made it so much easier.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19135-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe it switched to the second minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19138-0
<v Ricky Horton>Single next is good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19141-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think I will be coming for a while,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19161-0
<v Ricky Horton>What are the coding guys trying to do
with this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19200-0
<v Ricky Horton>The main thing is to use this to take off
of square footage,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19200-1
<v Ricky Horton>so kind of puts Bob on boards instead of
having to take off and give you assembly</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19200-2
<v Ricky Horton>tracking cause right now it's all paper.
So if we can correlate their own</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19200-3
<v Ricky Horton>independent projects,
it's also coincide with ours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19228-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then we can have on fluid streaming
process because right now it's a e-mail</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19228-1
<v Ricky Horton>communication between the departments.
So unless you follow up, it should be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19259-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you're going to put all the you're
going to put all the assemblies into the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19259-1
<v Ricky Horton>database, I suppose,
or one of them will be out specific,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19259-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yeah,
it'll be a hit file and work and you can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19259-3
<v Ricky Horton>come there to assembly and it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19268-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, don't say kiss. Yes, we did switch.
But for for Kody's introduction.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19268-1
<v Ricky Horton>So they've been. Yeah, yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19295-0
<v Ricky Horton>I got flamed on LinkedIn recently because
I was like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19295-1
<v Ricky Horton>I will kill kiss files if I can kill them.
And I got flamed by so many people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19295-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's like guys, you just don't look,
you don't get it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19303-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's one of those things.
That's the old school drive, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19312-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
it is still such a prevalent phylotype.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19315-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just because people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19327-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is what I've always done, right?
And so people just don't know to know to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19327-1
<v Ricky Horton>try something different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19338-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I'd like to turn it off just so
people have to find something different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19339-0
<v Ricky Horton>Scheduling.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19342-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be fine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19346-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, they they have to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19367-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we track everything through the shop,
read the information back to the PM.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19367-1
<v Ricky Horton>He has to do all the calculations on the
labor and update his his stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19404-0
<v Ricky Horton>Currently they're using Vista and we're
like 10 days behind. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19404-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's no course correction 10 days.
So will they find benefit out of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19404-2
<v Ricky Horton>production planner or the?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19408-0
<v Ricky Horton>Other scheduled in here my.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19436-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right now we have all these different
people asking us for different reports.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19436-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't need to know what they're doing
to talk to you, but you're 10 days behind.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19436-2
<v Ricky Horton>I guess your forecasting that's fine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19478-0
<v Ricky Horton>We want to be able,
and we have a bunch of different</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19478-1
<v Ricky Horton>spreadsheets and whatnot.
We just want to get everything down into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19478-2
<v Ricky Horton>one. Yeah, we can track everything.
We can look at it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19478-3
<v Ricky Horton>just be much more efficient.
The the problem I have with tech on this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19507-0
<v Ricky Horton>Once again,
I can talk bad about what I don't, Alexis,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19507-1
<v Ricky Horton>and I'll work for him.
I begged him to incorporate the planner</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19507-2
<v Ricky Horton>with the project schedule that's in here
and they would not do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19535-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I think, I think it's because so,
so few are actually using that schedule</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19535-1
<v Ricky Horton>in there because it's a big,
it's a big thing and so but they they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19535-2
<v Ricky Horton>didn't incorporate it and I wish they had
so the two don't talk.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19573-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now work packages can show up on that
on the project schedule, but it doesn't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19573-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't look at the work packages as
far as the new dates and everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19573-2
<v Ricky Horton>So the dates on your work package don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19584-0
<v Ricky Horton>Correlate necessarily to the dates on the
schedule, so that's annoying to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19590-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't get what I wish because my name
isn't tackled, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19605-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we did. I mean scheduling,
scheduling,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19605-1
<v Ricky Horton>scheduling how everybody wants this
critical path, Gantt chart,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19605-2
<v Ricky Horton>blah blah blah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19608-0
<v Ricky Horton>But what I was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19645-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can never make it work until you until
the shop and the lines of the material</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19645-1
<v Ricky Horton>couldn't do anything right.
Typically they they get stuck in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19645-2
<v Ricky Horton>engineering and customer rules.
I don't care.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19645-3
<v Ricky Horton>They get stuck somewhere and you create
these.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19681-0
<v Ricky Horton>Schedules,
but until you really have it in a ghost</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19681-1
<v Ricky Horton>state, yeah, it's meeting.
So you have to have something that could</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19681-2
<v Ricky Horton>really move it and update it easily.
And we were really bad on knowing how</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19681-3
<v Ricky Horton>long tasks took because.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19711-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ten years ago,
the guys had lots of experience and the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19711-1
<v Ricky Horton>new guys that got coming in had no
experience.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19711-2
<v Ricky Horton>And so tasks were taken twice as long.
Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19711-3
<v Ricky Horton>and so the labor just wasn't updated.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19751-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hours. It's like, hey,
we knew you were running over on hours,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19751-1
<v Ricky Horton>but the scheduling software had no real
hooks in it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19751-2
<v Ricky Horton>to be able to make adjustments like that
and then ripple through the schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19751-3
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
and and one of the biggest issues</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19751-4
<v Ricky Horton>everywhere with scheduling is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19782-0
<v Ricky Horton>Capturing the time that it actually took
and then getting it into the schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19782-1
<v Ricky Horton>And so you know,
I don't know a lot of people that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19782-2
<v Ricky Horton>actually capture their time,
but much past just the job level.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19799-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
not even down to sequence or to lot or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19799-1
<v Ricky Horton>now work package.
I don't know too many that that track</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19799-2
<v Ricky Horton>there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19831-0
<v Ricky Horton>Their labor back close. So,
but it's the only way a signal will work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19831-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
you've got to know how long does it take</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19831-2
<v Ricky Horton>to last 1000 square feet.
How long does it take to to set up?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19834-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think the shops that I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19859-0
<v Ricky Horton>One of the things you want the chains,
everybody's have a client meeting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19859-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's have a client meeting and what
we're going to do. I think so approach.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19859-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think you need to do after the meeting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19877-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is what we're gonna do tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19877-1
<v Ricky Horton>because it changes the whole thinking
process of you have that meeting,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19877-2
<v Ricky Horton>what you're gonna do tomorrow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19923-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then people start realizing that
they're not ready.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19923-1
<v Ricky Horton>And they realize that at 2:00 in the
afternoon,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19923-2
<v Ricky Horton>instead of at 6:00 in the morning or five
in the morning with the whole crew is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19923-3
<v Ricky Horton>there, you've got a little time to react.
And it changes your way of thinking about</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19923-4
<v Ricky Horton>how it works.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19925-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't. I mean, some people do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19937-0
<v Ricky Horton>It it is a hard mindset to shift that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19974-0
<v Ricky Horton>The main,
the main purpose for the look at, look at,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19974-1
<v Ricky Horton>oh,
look at spend or think they're called</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19974-2
<v Ricky Horton>underreleased work packages or something
like that is to reserve a spot in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19974-3
<v Ricky Horton>schedule. Yeah, so estimating can say, oh,
there's a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19999-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have something in house.
It's just not ready. Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19999-1
<v Ricky Horton>And it's we're taking,
they're taking up this much time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19999-2
<v Ricky Horton>These guys just start cramming **** down.
It's like we have to figure it out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/19999-3
<v Ricky Horton>Coding is just an absolute. It's chaos.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20002-0
<v Ricky Horton>Absolute chaos. There's no.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20018-0
<v Ricky Horton>We plan daily.
That's where most of my time is helping</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20018-1
<v Ricky Horton>these guys plan the guard space and just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20052-0
<v Ricky Horton>Excuse me from logic in how things work.
And it's always said that there's no how</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20052-1
<v Ricky Horton>many coding jobs would you say go through
in a week or a month, 10 or 1000?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20052-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know, probably 1010 to 15,
but it may vary per week.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20088-0
<v Ricky Horton>Per month, 10 per month,
but they vary in size. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20088-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's we're quoting on the border of
all. Oh, that's a shot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20088-2
<v Ricky Horton>We did a a WW infill job last year lasted
I think 8-9 months.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20088-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you have that kind of work and then
you'll have.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20129-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
Arizona Water with the Gilbert water</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20129-1
<v Ricky Horton>treatment time. We, I mean,
there's stuff coming in and out every</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20129-2
<v Ricky Horton>week. Yeah.
So what we would do is we have things</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20129-3
<v Ricky Horton>very big jobs, right?
This got to the last place.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20133-0
<v Ricky Horton>And these bays are going to be big jobs
and then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20146-0
<v Ricky Horton>On a daily basis, we get can we do this,
can we do this, can we do this, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20146-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's just constant and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20184-0
<v Ricky Horton>You've got to keep the big hitters moving.
You just got them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20184-1
<v Ricky Horton>You cannot chop into this thing because
any money you make on a rush job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20184-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to lose it on the big job.
So we just had a quick hitting team.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20219-0
<v Ricky Horton>They got a Bay or half a Bay,
whatever it was,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20219-1
<v Ricky Horton>and then they would do it and we made
them sub out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20219-2
<v Ricky Horton>Probably to you guys all coding.
There's only scheduled work that goes in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20219-3
<v Ricky Horton>coding facility. We didn't let.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20256-0
<v Ricky Horton>Quick hitting jobs with coding. You know,
I don't know if it's the same year,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20256-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you know you got sandblasting.
You can only do so many pieces of setup</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20256-2
<v Ricky Horton>before you got to clean that area out.
Same thing. Next code, next code.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20256-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we did not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20280-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not saying any,
but we really try to avoid unplanned work</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20280-1
<v Ricky Horton>through the COVID facility because it fit
disruptors. We would,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20280-2
<v Ricky Horton>we would love to do that,
but we got one a month ago.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20282-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20327-0
<v Ricky Horton>I was here when I think you guys were
getting in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20327-1
<v Ricky Horton>I walked through the tour and you guys
were like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20327-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it sounds like you guys just
swallowed it. We smashed it. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20327-3
<v Ricky Horton>we but that's good.
It was great because we we made so much</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20327-4
<v Ricky Horton>damn money in such a short period of time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20351-0
<v Ricky Horton>We really knocked that apart and then it
led to another like 6 truck loads.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20351-1
<v Ricky Horton>But did you have to sacrifice anything?
And what was the sacrifice? We we had a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-0
<v Ricky Horton>We were ahead of schedule,
so we really didn't sacrifice anything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-1
<v Ricky Horton>We just,
we just kind of left that order that was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-2
<v Ricky Horton>in house going to go back on schedule
instead of pulling it forward.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-3
<v Ricky Horton>We just put it in there.
But if we didn't hit our numbers,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-4
<v Ricky Horton>it would have,
it could have pushed that schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20394-5
<v Ricky Horton>That schedule was in jeopardy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20420-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the cool thing is we have field
people too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20420-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we we pulled in some field guys for
that job and have them work on that job</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20420-2
<v Ricky Horton>while the other guys were still working
on some of the other jobs so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20468-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they don't.
There's not a whole lot of time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20468-1
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of these,
a lot of the jobs we do our rush.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20468-2
<v Ricky Horton>We keep getting like they move so quickly.
You know, like this back job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20468-3
<v Ricky Horton>we'll spend 6-7 months dealing with the
the, the set up and the, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20468-4
<v Ricky Horton>all the ******** waiting before we get
started.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20486-0
<v Ricky Horton>Fabrication where coatings will be like
we'll be on the phone on Monday and like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20486-1
<v Ricky Horton>Friday we're receiving steal.
So it's way faster moving what we get.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20518-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you do a majority of their stuff.
Like there's very there's not a lot that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20518-1
<v Ricky Horton>are like preplanned out.
How many places can you last?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20518-2
<v Ricky Horton>Right now we should only be like stand
left in hand with financing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20519-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20529-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're trying to utilize that as much as
possible, but it's such a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20560-0
<v Ricky Horton>Machine and then it's in this ****** spot.
So trying to move big stuff through there</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20560-1
<v Ricky Horton>and we do a lot of tape place.
That's the funny thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20560-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know why they said it or they
said it, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20562-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20586-0
<v Ricky Horton>The penguin is useless to be there,
the overhead,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20586-1
<v Ricky Horton>the plate you could design it.
So if it was most plates, not bad,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20586-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's not bad the right width.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20595-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's kind of a real small window,
so but it works for the beeps.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20623-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or when you want to play,
you want to play through a sideways</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20623-1
<v Ricky Horton>hanging off the conveyors,
that's a nightmare in the place to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20623-2
<v Ricky Horton>involve.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20654-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying that we're seeing the Gods
support those beams there. Yeah, well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20654-1
<v Ricky Horton>which is what you're really saying is if
you don't have a wheel that shoots like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20654-2
<v Ricky Horton>this,
you have a wheel that shoot like I got</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20654-3
<v Ricky Horton>both.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20673-0
<v Ricky Horton>The one that's when it's off with what
we're getting there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20673-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's from the size that they would
do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20704-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would do pretty well on like on a
ascendance,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20704-1
<v Ricky Horton>like these reflanges and base plates and
stuff like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20704-2
<v Ricky Horton>But it's there's no way it's a continuous
moving conveyor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20704-3
<v Ricky Horton>so you have to pick it up in the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20728-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's too much.
And then you put money into that thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20728-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's ancient, you know,
you have the blue machine, which is,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20728-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
a horizontal machine and it's a plate</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20728-3
<v Ricky Horton>machine, so it's just got four wheels.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20731-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the one that we used to be noticed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20766-0
<v Ricky Horton>30 years old and it's the wheel operator
machine and it was designed as like an</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20766-1
<v Ricky Horton>economy machine.
It wasn't supposed to last 10 years,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20766-2
<v Ricky Horton>so we are dumping much.
We've dumped a lot of money in that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20766-3
<v Ricky Horton>machine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20803-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's all we're basically for solar power,
but we're using it for other stuff,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20803-1
<v Ricky Horton>trying to put too much stuff through
there as possible and then take it out to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20803-2
<v Ricky Horton>blast. If the if the numbers make sense,
we'll build that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20832-0
<v Ricky Horton>We got a bunch of small parts.
We can't hand glass.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20832-1
<v Ricky Horton>We put them in a basket,
put it through that machine and it's a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20832-2
<v Ricky Horton>good time safer.
So just each job has to be Coding's guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20832-3
<v Ricky Horton>are all real technical. They understand.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20860-0
<v Ricky Horton>That means they can plan that they don't.
They don't think outside the box.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20860-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's it's more of a a lot of processing
production lines.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20860-2
<v Ricky Horton>They they like to lay everything out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20911-0
<v Ricky Horton>And do a big batch and then it's like and
I tell them these these things that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20911-1
<v Ricky Horton>started over there have been sitting
either for you know 10 hours you know and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20911-2
<v Ricky Horton>then you're not going to touch anything
until tomorrow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20911-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that means sitting there for 19 hours,
no worse than being done on it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20911-4
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm trying to get them to focus on
smaller batches.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20912-0
<v Ricky Horton>1.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20938-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they they really need the schedule.
They need that the time they're talking</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20938-1
<v Ricky Horton>about.
Not that it's going to change anything,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20938-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it can.
It gives everybody an idea that we might</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20938-3
<v Ricky Horton>have to bring more people in for this job
or or whatever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20956-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or maybe you can sum it out.
Is the importance more the long-term view</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20956-1
<v Ricky Horton>or the here's where we are over the next
2-3 weeks?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/20966-0
<v Ricky Horton>We wanna go as far as possible.
So for coding, what we're gonna do is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21004-0
<v Ricky Horton>The week ahead of whatever week here is
locked that not touched that week and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21004-1
<v Ricky Horton>then it's the the following weeks can be
adjusted. Gotcha.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21004-2
<v Ricky Horton>And what I wanted to do is schedule,
trying to get them in the mindset of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21004-3
<v Ricky Horton>scheduling dead time and schedule things
so that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21039-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's short lead time or or emergency
guard to try not to impact the schedule</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21039-1
<v Ricky Horton>as much.
I think everybody wants to see it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21039-2
<v Ricky Horton>Jeff is big on this.
He he has everyone working on a master</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21039-3
<v Ricky Horton>schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-0
<v Ricky Horton>The current schedule, Yep.
And all these details.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then we're looking at Tectonic,
the tech that can do most of the stuff</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-2
<v Ricky Horton>already. Yeah,
instead of having all these spreadsheets</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-3
<v Ricky Horton>with all these, you know,
the office personnel working on making</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-4
<v Ricky Horton>issues. Yeah, take a time. I mean,
we have a guy that was in Todi's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21081-5
<v Ricky Horton>literally. That's all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21114-0
<v Ricky Horton>We did pretty much. Yeah. Spreadsheets.
Yeah. And he recently left,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21114-1
<v Ricky Horton>so it's a great time to get started on
this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21114-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's the value of spreadsheets is
everybody knows how to operate</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21114-3
<v Ricky Horton>spreadsheet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21148-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the bad part is,
is disconnected from everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21148-1
<v Ricky Horton>So there's a manual update for everything.
So I think it's so much better having it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21148-2
<v Ricky Horton>in the system. I mean,
I would do everything I could to get it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21148-3
<v Ricky Horton>in there. Yeah, I agree with you.
Who can streamline it all?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21148-4
<v Ricky Horton>So there's reason.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21162-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we're really trying to and we're just
be over the device because yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21162-1
<v Ricky Horton>we can't afford it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21184-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then on top of that, it's I mean,
these guys are are busy all day and it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21184-1
<v Ricky Horton>like we start looking at what people are
actually doing. It's like there's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21226-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean for some of these guys with actual
work and the rest of like paperwork or or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21226-1
<v Ricky Horton>updating. Yeah,
all this **** that's it's like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21226-2
<v Ricky Horton>I couldn't believe my site was wonderful
and I was like, I don't know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21226-3
<v Ricky Horton>there's another company that needs to
have spreadsheets to run stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21234-0
<v Ricky Horton>We used to do what we call a hard same
thing. Wonder book, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21303-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hour a week to keep it up later.
And then it's like I I'm trying to teach</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21303-1
<v Ricky Horton>everybody the question.
When people ask for a report asking,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21303-2
<v Ricky Horton>give it to them because I'm not into.
I'm not into like, oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21303-3
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to see what you. No, I don't.
I don't care if you want to see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21303-4
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to see, you figure out how to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21342-0
<v Ricky Horton>You wouldn't believe the number of
reports I kill at some at some shots.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21342-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like if they're switching,
like if I go to the shop to switch it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21342-2
<v Ricky Horton>from Fat Patrol to to this,
it's like I tell them I OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21342-3
<v Ricky Horton>now's the time to review everything.
Why do we do this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so I'll, I'll simply be like, well,
I need this form, that form,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-1
<v Ricky Horton>that form or this would report something.
And so there's been some objectors like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-2
<v Ricky Horton>OK, what do you use that for?
I don't know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-3
<v Ricky Horton>I just have to give it to the shop.
I'll go to the shop. I'm like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-4
<v Ricky Horton>what do you do with this report?
I don't know. They give it to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21394-5
<v Ricky Horton>I'll throw it away. So you know, I I find.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21429-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've done that stuff all the time because
somebody at some point asked for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21429-1
<v Ricky Horton>something and then it became the standard,
but nobody actually used it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21429-2
<v Ricky Horton>Every once in a while I used to run a job
myself and it was all this paperwork.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21429-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would just hold paperwork back just to
see if anybody came and asked me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21468-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't use this. I don't know why you got.
Oh well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21468-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know the ISO manual paragraph 6.
3 says we got to do this like we don't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21468-2
<v Ricky Horton>use it. Well, that's it.
I don't want to do that, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21506-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know I find that too,
when some people are like, well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21506-1
<v Ricky Horton>our quality manual says we have to.
I'm like, well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21506-2
<v Ricky Horton>can't we just change the manual?
And they're like, well, no,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21506-3
<v Ricky Horton>that takes 13 people to do that. So yeah,
so that's that's really what we want to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21506-4
<v Ricky Horton>use it that portion.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21511-0
<v Ricky Horton>Project managers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21543-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mark is up to date. What do you run?
Like 8 hours behind? 10 hours behind?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21543-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's your. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Coding to 10 days behind. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21543-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then do a manual estimate to to kind
of fill in the gaps. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21543-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we want to get.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21567-0
<v Ricky Horton>Want to get Mark up to speed within
minutes and then podiums come along to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21567-1
<v Ricky Horton>let it up to the left.
When you say up to speed,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21567-2
<v Ricky Horton>it means the guys that wanting their time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21586-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the goal we've got.
We're geared up harder,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21586-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I think we're gonna have a faith in
where we're gonna need to make sure that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21586-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21603-0
<v Ricky Horton>The last thing I want to do is is keep
going to this and then screen all kind of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21603-1
<v Ricky Horton>problems within there and someone's
having to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21612-0
<v Ricky Horton>So do you have a longer time every day to
a data mix?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21659-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
so when Alex creates the work package,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21659-1
<v Ricky Horton>he's creating the labour code that
pertains to each one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21659-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we do it very granularly,
having it will burn and then each of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21659-3
<v Ricky Horton>guys pick on their workstation,
you know how they worked.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21711-0
<v Ricky Horton>8 hours on welding today,
then he'll talk to the job number and the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21711-1
<v Ricky Horton>sequence code and then it all rolls up
into this database of QC signed off.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21711-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is he ever linked himself or is he? Yes,
all the employees get their time manually</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21711-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then my phone number use it to make
sure there's any issues.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21711-4
<v Ricky Horton>Some guy that forgets to take out the
notice break.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21726-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mentioned our yeah, they started,
they took this area or so we make those</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21726-1
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments. So the system.
So what I'm used to do is guide the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21730-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what starts at everybody if you
want it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21758-0
<v Ricky Horton>The new job 683 Work Center 25 on that
job at work center.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21758-1
<v Ricky Horton>Halfway through the day,
there's a lunch break.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21758-2
<v Ricky Horton>This is just docs to lunch for everybody.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21783-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so there's no worrying about you're
going to get docked for lunch,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21783-1
<v Ricky Horton>but nobody has to do anything.
It's just automatic.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21783-2
<v Ricky Horton>You get 2 breaks and lunch is just docked.
No interacting with anything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21806-0
<v Ricky Horton>You go to a different job, the job,
the minute you type into that job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21806-1
<v Ricky Horton>the other one is you don't have to walk
out of that one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21806-2
<v Ricky Horton>It just knows you went into this one.
It closed that one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21837-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, we were in mid manage,
which had its own problems.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21837-1
<v Ricky Horton>We went to IFS,
which was an order of magnitude worse.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21837-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm not saying mid manage.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21841-0
<v Ricky Horton>Time tracking was decent up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21855-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I'm just wondering,
I mean be interested to see the mechanics</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21855-1
<v Ricky Horton>here around it because there shouldn't be
this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21887-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, redundant I'm tracking.
That just happens today.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21887-1
<v Ricky Horton>Just like with a lot of software,
somebody's good is the key point putting</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21887-2
<v Ricky Horton>the data right.
Sometimes in a 12 hour share,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21887-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm working on four projects. Oh,
I worked on one. So guys get a little.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21921-0
<v Ricky Horton>Placing it,
but we have those checks and balances.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21921-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, my department,
the department had to check as well here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21921-2
<v Ricky Horton>but there wasn't, you know,
the guys have to, like you said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21921-3
<v Ricky Horton>they have to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we've tried to talk system for a
while, but then with us being out here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-1
<v Ricky Horton>we didn't have as much IT support back
then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-2
<v Ricky Horton>So there was claw downtime and then we
just, you know, back to paper copies.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-3
<v Ricky Horton>But right now we have our facial
recognition. One,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-4
<v Ricky Horton>we hadn't got that until mid during COVID
and then we use that as a as a safety</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21968-5
<v Ricky Horton>check on our NMA.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/21974-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you got here at 4:15, not 4:00.
Got to document something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22005-0
<v Ricky Horton>Was that on our system?
It's a little confusing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22005-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we're to the the pads which I I get
it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22005-2
<v Ricky Horton>but that's what that's what tech was
designed to do. So they.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22031-0
<v Ricky Horton>They can go in with the job,
got loads of drawings and the other they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22031-1
<v Ricky Horton>need and then they're out and then he's
getting they're getting updates. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22031-2
<v Ricky Horton>this cut's done on this,
the ball's done on this and it's up to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22031-3
<v Ricky Horton>the speed.
Do we need the drawings on that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22074-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep. So like if we pull,
how big is that like that? It's set up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22074-1
<v Ricky Horton>The nicest one I've ever seen is so they
have big job box and the guy's got a big</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22074-2
<v Ricky Horton>touch screen, like 28 inch,
a big monitor in there that you could</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22074-3
<v Ricky Horton>really.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22090-0
<v Ricky Horton>See all of them. I think in your idea.
I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22090-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know how many drives in the
drawing packages,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22090-2
<v Ricky Horton>but this thing is awesome and each.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22136-0
<v Ricky Horton>Workstation, job, you know, job.
So there's a monitor that's touch.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22136-1
<v Ricky Horton>They can really see drawing to the school.
I think each one on our assembly,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22136-2
<v Ricky Horton>it'll pull up each individual one and
then maybe go into further details with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22136-3
<v Ricky Horton>parts.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22173-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have 9 inch tablets and that's what I'm
using in the shop where I was. Um,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22173-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys don't. It doesn't matter.
Everybody is so used to doing this anyway</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22173-2
<v Ricky Horton>and moving it makes a zero difference.
We we bought bigger ones for the QC guys.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22209-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they ended up. I don't like it.
They wanted the smaller one just because</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22209-1
<v Ricky Horton>it was easier to carry and they can save
them in and out all in one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22209-2
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody's used to it. So and I'm funny,
I'm a paper man. Yeah, to me,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22209-3
<v Ricky Horton>when I watch these guys put a few things
electronically,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22209-4
<v Ricky Horton>it just happened in the book.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22241-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well, the the beauty.
The beauty of the tablet though,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22241-1
<v Ricky Horton>is when when a revision is imported,
it immediately,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22241-2
<v Ricky Horton>it immediately updates that draw and they
can't get it all drawn.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22286-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you don't have the bad dash to the
shop,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22286-1
<v Ricky Horton>still find all the drawings and somebody
has one stuck in their toolbox and you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22286-2
<v Ricky Horton>can't, you can't get it. You know,
the flex side of it is, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22286-3
<v Ricky Horton>your notes that you put out there because
it was this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22315-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I have seen standardized iPads and the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22315-1
<v Ricky Horton>Androids. They work further.
I've seen them in shops as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22315-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's pretty cool, you know, you'll be.
I was shocked when I first put in place</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22315-3
<v Ricky Horton>in the shop. I was new. I was like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22366-0
<v Ricky Horton>And my guys, I don't know.
That's going to be like pulling teeth for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22366-1
<v Ricky Horton>me to get a place. I want to be in place,
but and I was shocked. They pushed me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22366-2
<v Ricky Horton>And now that I go around doing this
across the country, I am floored.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22366-3
<v Ricky Horton>Every shop I go to once and then says
what I hear, you don't know my guys.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22366-4
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like, I do know you guys.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22405-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've seen this 100 times.
I'll win 80% of people right out of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22405-1
<v Ricky Horton>gate, and then I'll win 10 to 15% of them.
And they'll want to go to tablets after</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22405-2
<v Ricky Horton>they've used it for a couple weeks.
And then 5% of them just are never going</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22405-3
<v Ricky Horton>to like you no matter what you do,
you know? So, but I'm for the Lord.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22446-0
<v Ricky Horton>That how our guys take to it.
I'm I I it's still surprising me to this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22446-1
<v Ricky Horton>day. So like the piece part,
if I had to make a piece part and it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22446-2
<v Ricky Horton>got 3 features, whatever,
simple drawings like that piece part,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22446-3
<v Ricky Horton>no problem.
But if you're a guy running a job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22446-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's got.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22485-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hundreds of parts or thousands of parts
and he needs to see how they go together.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22485-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just,
I don't want to see because he's trying</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22485-2
<v Ricky Horton>to plan it out.
I haven't really seen that one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22485-3
<v Ricky Horton>He's giving up all those parts in the
smaller sections. This guy's doing this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22485-4
<v Ricky Horton>this guy's doing that,
this guy's doing that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22513-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I, you know,
I got plants running massive trusses that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22513-1
<v Ricky Horton>are that are running the tablets.
Bridge work, I mean mining type stuff,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22513-2
<v Ricky Horton>NASA type stuff and those guys are
running them on the tablets.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22543-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's, it's really. You'd be surprised.
Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22543-1
<v Ricky Horton>You guys got to understand about this
place is the environment.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22543-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we got the iPads right now.
They stay inside.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22588-0
<v Ricky Horton>The office over here,
which doesn't do us any good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22588-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we bought a we bought a rolling
charger, post 20 iPads.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22588-2
<v Ricky Horton>Right now we can keep it out wherever it
doesn't matter.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22588-3
<v Ricky Horton>But in the summer we're going to take a
beverage center,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22588-4
<v Ricky Horton>a refrigerator and modify it and that's
what.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22623-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're about to sit because our iPads are
shut down in the summer.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22623-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we we're battling like stupid things
here. I think I told you,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22623-2
<v Ricky Horton>but do you know all things now?
So they're QC lading.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22664-0
<v Ricky Horton>That that handles it.
A freezer for in their shop because we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22664-1
<v Ricky Horton>looking for our work list for shipping
receiving soft side cooler.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22709-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. Everything shuts down.
All of the products. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22709-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's a because I like what Eric's saying.
That's what I want.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22709-2
<v Ricky Horton>I want screens in the shop.
I want a place they can go. I want.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22709-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'd really like the TV up with the
schedule. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22709-4
<v Ricky Horton>So people can see what's going on. Yeah.
And.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22711-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not here, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22722-0
<v Ricky Horton>Refuse. Yeah, I was all shocked that they,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22722-1
<v Ricky Horton>they had the dollars of the bonus.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22755-0
<v Ricky Horton>Real time on the floor. Well, guys,
I know it's like they're watching.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22755-1
<v Ricky Horton>It just went down.
It wasn't that real time,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22755-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I think it's day-to-day.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22795-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whether everything was ahead of schedule,
behind schedule, reworked, whatever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22795-1
<v Ricky Horton>But they kept that real-time bonus up
there. That's intense.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22795-2
<v Ricky Horton>I I used to the shop files that everybody
had a tablet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22795-3
<v Ricky Horton>It didn't matter who they were.
And for a while I started emailing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22795-4
<v Ricky Horton>everybody because everybody had an e-mail
address too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22842-0
<v Ricky Horton>I started emailing to everybody
automatically a report of what everybody</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22842-1
<v Ricky Horton>did the day before work.
So all the pieces they produced.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22842-2
<v Ricky Horton>So the guys that were killing were like,
look what I did and the other guys were</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22842-3
<v Ricky Horton>like, holy ****, to see what I didn't do,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22842-4
<v Ricky Horton>and it actually was pretty phenomenal.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22879-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've got I have guys on our on our
robotic welder first secretary ship guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22879-1
<v Ricky Horton>getting in a contest because they're like
oh I can do more than you you know and so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22879-2
<v Ricky Horton>they started getting in the contest.
It's kind of cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22879-3
<v Ricky Horton>So but they did that to beamlines.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22891-0
<v Ricky Horton>They'd crank out 3400 be 3 or 400 calls
in one day because they would have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22891-1
<v Ricky Horton>competitions. Yeah, that was pretty funny,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22930-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
it's interesting to see what motivates</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22930-1
<v Ricky Horton>people. Yeah, money. It is. I used to do,
like, a lot of twenty-them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22930-2
<v Ricky Horton>And I said to a good welder, I said,
I bet you can't well five days on a day.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22930-3
<v Ricky Horton>Here's 100 bucks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22934-0
<v Ricky Horton>And the day they were done,
it's 100 bucks. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22934-1
<v Ricky Horton>And my kids do that everything. Yeah,
yeah, exactly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22951-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's easy to kill yourself for one day.
It's hard to do it all week and then come</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22951-1
<v Ricky Horton>back and do it next week. That's right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22999-0
<v Ricky Horton>I tried to get our owner to do the kind
of the new core thing where it's like, OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22999-1
<v Ricky Horton>we make X amount of money and it's X
percentage of, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22999-2
<v Ricky Horton>X percentage of profit,
then we're going to take this amount,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/22999-3
<v Ricky Horton>this amount of that and just hand it to
everybody.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23028-0
<v Ricky Horton>So everybody's whole mindset was the
bottom line, right? You know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23028-1
<v Ricky Horton>and I couldn't get him to do it for
nothing. I could not get him to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23028-2
<v Ricky Horton>He's like, well, then I'd have to,
you know, family owned business.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23063-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's like, yeah,
then we'd have to let everybody know what,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23063-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know, what our income is. I'm like,
who cares? I like the more you make,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23063-2
<v Ricky Horton>the more they make. Who cares?
I couldn't get them to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23064-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23108-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I I have seen also people get
compensated for certain things that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23108-1
<v Ricky Horton>actually worked against the company.
Like I'll I'll see a lot where purchasers</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23108-2
<v Ricky Horton>and PMS are fighting with each other
because the purchaser.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23148-0
<v Ricky Horton>Purchase the material.
They're they're paying based off of how</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23148-1
<v Ricky Horton>well they utilize the material.
Purchase it under budget. Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23148-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then it's so detrimental to the shop
because now all these pieces have to be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23148-3
<v Ricky Horton>save this remnant on here.
It has to go back down the yard for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23148-4
<v Ricky Horton>another sequence.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23177-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so the handling went through the roof
flat because I could and it would have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23177-1
<v Ricky Horton>been a lot faster process it played. Yeah,
if I could have thrown it on a burn table.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23177-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.
But now you have to hand process</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23177-3
<v Ricky Horton>everything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
is that I don't need bonuses up with any</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-1
<v Ricky Horton>of the material I work here.
So I go straight into the shop.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-2
<v Ricky Horton>How do you want this done? I think, yeah,
you guys tell me where it's gonna make</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-3
<v Ricky Horton>the most sense for you guys to guys that
are working. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's like sometimes I don't talk to them
and then they come back to me and they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23222-5
<v Ricky Horton>say, yeah,
we need to do to read you the order.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23225-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23271-0
<v Ricky Horton>I do like the shotgun involved in those
decisions because they actually do this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23271-1
<v Ricky Horton>**** every day, all day.
They know the best way to do it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23271-2
<v Ricky Horton>and they're going to.
Sometimes you still and the people love</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23271-3
<v Ricky Horton>that for me out there.
But like if you prefer the platformer and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23271-4
<v Ricky Horton>that's how it's going to be a problem for
sure, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23303-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we were pretty close to buttering our</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23303-1
<v Ricky Horton>shop. Yeah, yeah,
I think it's changed too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23303-2
<v Ricky Horton>because it used to be all manual layout
and so you want to try to run something</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23303-3
<v Ricky Horton>through a laser,
put all the features in it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23303-4
<v Ricky Horton>embed it into a manual.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23328-0
<v Ricky Horton>But then all of a sudden you have this
little shape, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23328-1
<v Ricky Horton>shape plasmas like you do the same thing.
So now you can go back to the shape.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23328-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you can look like a press brace step,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23333-0
<v Ricky Horton>All it still just keeps on changing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23383-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, finally,
I think we're starting to catch up a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23383-1
<v Ricky Horton>little bit with the technology that's
been in manufacturing for forever, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23383-2
<v Ricky Horton>And it's just that the structural
specifically has been so far behind just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23383-3
<v Ricky Horton>because it's like I just get out a bigger
hammer, you know, I don't need to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23392-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't need the technology side of it,
but I I think we're finally getting there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23392-1
<v Ricky Horton>Just been so far behind.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23408-0
<v Ricky Horton>There is a lot of the layout stuff now
for like even like stairs and rails and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23408-1
<v Ricky Horton>stuff and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23414-0
<v Ricky Horton>Finally, robotic welding is a thing, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23462-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's still coming slow for a lot of
places, though.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23462-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think the last shop I did,
they had one robotic builder and they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23462-2
<v Ricky Horton>sell them and used it.
Even they have steel that we have it a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23462-3
<v Ricky Horton>year and a half and complete it. Yeah,
there's other places they do really.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23494-0
<v Ricky Horton>We had it where I was and we had one for
about a year before I left there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23494-1
<v Ricky Horton>Since then they bought three more.
But now we were very heavy warehouse,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23494-2
<v Ricky Horton>so we did lots and lots of tube columns.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23526-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just simple, right?
You got a lot of the same parts you can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23526-1
<v Ricky Horton>set up for it,
but I think the vision systems or the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23526-2
<v Ricky Horton>detection systems have gotten to so much
better that you can get the lot sizes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23526-3
<v Ricky Horton>You don't have to fixture as much anymore.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23566-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it it didn't matter what what the
assembly was. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23566-1
<v Ricky Horton>they have it now to where it doesn't
matter if it was the same or not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23566-2
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't matter.
He knows what it's supposed to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23566-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we just ran a lot of that and the
reason it's so simple is because it could</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23566-4
<v Ricky Horton>well lose out 100%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23608-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas like some of the more complex
structural things, it couldn't get it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23608-1
<v Ricky Horton>it couldn't get in everywhere to Weld it
and a guy would have to finish it up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23608-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it was super simple.
Those everything was welded 100% but but</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23608-3
<v Ricky Horton>it it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23642-0
<v Ricky Horton>It didn't care what it was, you know,
it just pulled the data straight from the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23642-1
<v Ricky Horton>model and in order to pull it into the
welding robots database and it started</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23642-2
<v Ricky Horton>running it, you know, So pretty amazing.
I love that robots worked really well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23666-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we have the AVV early version hated it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23666-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it was too picky.
Then we got the Lincoln.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23666-2
<v Ricky Horton>That was the newest vision still needed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23678-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know I found a few times and they can
see what they were going where it was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23678-1
<v Ricky Horton>going. Holy ****.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23688-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
people like can implement that stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23688-1
<v Ricky Horton>They could go if it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23729-0
<v Ricky Horton>I find that the ones that implement that
stuff the best are just stubborn people.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23729-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's a lot of shops that do buy that
stuff and they don't want to put the work</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23729-2
<v Ricky Horton>into it to really make it work.
But the ones that are stubborn and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23729-3
<v Ricky Horton>determined it's going to work,
they'll make it work, you know?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23758-0
<v Ricky Horton>I do see a lot of robots sitting out.
I I I think a lot of them just,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23758-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I see the same robot working like
crazy at another shop.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23758-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think it has more to do with the people
running it than it does the equipment</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23758-3
<v Ricky Horton>itself.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23769-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now it's adding into.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23783-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, yes. And so now we don't have time,
so you have to take HSS and pass to it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23794-0
<v Ricky Horton>You guys run KPA Flex through the app?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23809-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
you can get it through your your phone as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23809-1
<v Ricky Horton>well. Yeah, you can.
It's easier with the app if you have CPI.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23814-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. Where is it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23815-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23832-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you go to your laptop,
if you go to Chrome,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23832-1
<v Ricky Horton>that doesn't make sense. close this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23856-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
just don't be surprised if it doesn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23856-1
<v Ricky Horton>work. Let me see, go there,
select one of those and go up to global</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23856-2
<v Ricky Horton>added operations here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23857-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23878-0
<v Ricky Horton>That doesn't make it. Uh,
look at that beams are showing. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23878-1
<v Ricky Horton>go to ships, grid sizes.
This doesn't make any sense how this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23878-2
<v Ricky Horton>could work.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23887-0
<v Ricky Horton>And go up to drop down and go shake
maintenance.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23894-0
<v Ricky Horton>And now go to SSHSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23899-0
<v Ricky Horton>How see the mature groups of these?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23909-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh my goodness, really? What is this HSSR?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23919-0
<v Ricky Horton>It changed to the same material group as
tubes. That's why it ought to be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23924-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wow, that's jacked up.
Let me look something here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23934-0
<v Ricky Horton>Man, man, man,
I'm wanting to see if that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23934-1
<v Ricky Horton>out-of-the-box.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23947-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you change SSTS to HSSSSSHSS, right?
Yes, yes. Let's see. Crap.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23951-0
<v Ricky Horton>Holy cow, that is our box.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23959-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're not using it yet, right?
We exchange that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23964-0
<v Ricky Horton>We we definitely need to change that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23965-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23977-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
I changed it to after all that can we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23977-1
<v Ricky Horton>well, can we export it and then?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/23990-0
<v Ricky Horton>Deleted and then just reimported after we
add the new post list.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24023-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. What? Well,
I'll tell you what I would say yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24023-1
<v Ricky Horton>because HSS is not. We exported from HSS,
so that'll work. I'm,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24023-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm kind of just wondering what I'm
saying if we.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24027-0
<v Ricky Horton>Duplicate this one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24039-0
<v Ricky Horton>Duplicate it and then delete it and then
just add when we have a new one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24044-0
<v Ricky Horton>Doesn't make sense why you approved.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24051-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anyone gets in my opinion,
but obviously it doesn't return me to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24055-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, operations, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24061-0
<v Ricky Horton>It'll matter. It'll matter for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24096-0
<v Ricky Horton>It'll matter greatly on the instrument
because it will use the beam labor codes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24096-1
<v Ricky Horton>rather than the two labor codes and the
labor operations will be a big difference.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24096-2
<v Ricky Horton>So why they why would they have it set?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24117-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think,
I think it's probably a screwed up. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24117-1
<v Ricky Horton>probably I've got a I I would get we
probably some of your estimates I've been</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24117-2
<v Ricky Horton>going through estimating and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24118-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24150-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know I knew there were some issues with
the default setup with some of the labor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24150-1
<v Ricky Horton>pins and like as an example,
plate out-of-the-box only does a burner</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24150-2
<v Ricky Horton>on width and length, not width length,
width length.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24179-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so I I threatened for a long time.
I'm going to go through all of them and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24179-1
<v Ricky Horton>get all.
I think I'm up to 28 different issues</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24179-2
<v Ricky Horton>that I see on labor case.
So that's probably right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24179-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's just the main side.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24181-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24214-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think we can just copy.
There's no way to just copy this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24214-1
<v Ricky Horton>In other words,
because all the all the sizes will come</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24214-2
<v Ricky Horton>over.
It's just going to be the format of it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24214-3
<v Ricky Horton>So what about an export? Can we export it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24225-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the text. Yeah,
you said exporting was intacting. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24225-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you export this out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24230-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that sucks. Holy cow, man.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24243-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now we probably just thought of delete.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24245-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24260-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think so.
Just go to the you'll have to go to shake</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24260-1
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance to do it, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24264-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hopefully it's not used anywhere.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24268-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to check that first?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24269-0
<v Ricky Horton>5.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24270-0
<v Ricky Horton>Help.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24280-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably. Or do we just want? Yeah, yeah,
try it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24290-0
<v Ricky Horton>Labor Standards.
Now that would be that one size though.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24296-0
<v Ricky Horton>Try it. It'll panic as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24299-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24313-0
<v Ricky Horton>Worst case,
we change it back to SSTS and then just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24313-1
<v Ricky Horton>set up a new one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24318-0
<v Ricky Horton>Standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24319-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24344-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we'd have, yeah, we got to delete that.
We can delete that labor standards and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24344-1
<v Ricky Horton>try it again,
just go up to maintenance and estimating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24351-0
<v Ricky Horton>Labor maintenance and Labor Standards.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24355-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just deleted out there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24365-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
now you definitely hope it's not there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24365-1
<v Ricky Horton>not being used.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24368-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24378-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now I'll just go up HSS and copy it
basically.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24381-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that's interesting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24389-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm amazing. Love of accents you guys.
I sleep right here, right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24390-0
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24394-0
<v Ricky Horton>That small. We have to do that.
I actually need to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24431-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can't remember you got this this
facility is doing landmark revenue that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24431-1
<v Ricky Horton>we were doing. I'm I I'm with you. Like,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24431-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was down lucid for a little bit and
couldn't do anything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24431-3
<v Ricky Horton>You'd have to call someone in and a
specialist in the administ in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24437-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to work,
but here it's like we serve this, this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24437-1
<v Ricky Horton>that and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24438-0
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24447-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's cool, but at the same time it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24465-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's great. It's great. It's great.
It's great at times,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24465-1
<v Ricky Horton>but other times it's like, holy cow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24474-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we would do the European change our
installer build database.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24487-0
<v Ricky Horton>They gave us all different parts,
but the other shop still have to keep</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24487-1
<v Ricky Horton>adding, keep adding.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24490-0
<v Ricky Horton>In a smaller.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24498-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's just like today.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24501-0
<v Ricky Horton>It works great.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24551-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's great about this is I will give
some large fabricators and it's like it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24551-1
<v Ricky Horton>takes an act of Congress to get anything
changed in the system.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24551-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's like we're sitting there. It's like,
come on guys, this is changes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24551-3
<v Ricky Horton>We can make a change today, right?
You're right. So that's the great thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24551-4
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24583-0
<v Ricky Horton>You instill a lot of confidence in us.
I don't do anything. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24583-1
<v Ricky Horton>I keep that doing. I'm not. He's not.
He's not afraid to make a mistake. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24610-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're here.
The guys in Gilbert are going,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24610-1
<v Ricky Horton>why is our database changing? Yeah,
good video. Or why is it so slow?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24610-2
<v Ricky Horton>Because we're updating the database.
That does happen a lot when I do some</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24610-3
<v Ricky Horton>places like everybody is like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24621-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why's the system so slow a little over
kind of in this right in the middle? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24621-1
<v Ricky Horton>staring at the top.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24640-0
<v Ricky Horton>Again,
I think the one key step to learn is only</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24640-1
<v Ricky Horton>8 by 8, so Mr.
Billy starts chopping down the side of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24640-2
<v Ricky Horton>the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24644-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, they got like the bottom it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24659-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we should be able to then hopefully on
day estimating at that point that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24659-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24666-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
you want to get a maintenance and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24666-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimating.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24667-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24686-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now we'll have to get HSS and
hopefully be able to see it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24704-0
<v Ricky Horton>You'll need to do it the other way.
Right now you're passing from SSHSS to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24704-1
<v Ricky Horton>something else.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24705-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24721-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you need to select what you want to
pass and then go in to it and select what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24721-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're passing into, correct? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24752-0
<v Ricky Horton>And even though we were on like one and a
quarter by one and a quarter too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24752-1
<v Ricky Horton>it can go to everything else because of
that extrapolation factor makes it grow</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24752-2
<v Ricky Horton>for like 8 inch feet, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24763-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, now SSHSS should have time.
Let's make sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24765-0
<v Ricky Horton>What tracks move?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24766-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24796-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go up to maintenance and estimating.
Actually go to go to labor standard</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24796-1
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance drop down.
You might be able to get there from here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24796-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, view labor operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24838-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then Scroll down to move right here.
So get piece would be OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24838-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's in the yard somewhere.
We're grabbing it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24838-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're taking it up to the machine to cut.
Move would be pretty much all movement</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24838-3
<v Ricky Horton>through the shop everywhere.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24875-0
<v Ricky Horton>After that. So now it's customizable too.
You can do, you can slip ahead,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24875-1
<v Ricky Horton>but that's definition of it, yeah.
And then is it driven by weight?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24875-2
<v Ricky Horton>So move right there.
You see the extrapolation factor says it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24875-3
<v Ricky Horton>varies, varies directly by length.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24911-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.
So I was looking at the length of it in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24911-1
<v Ricky Horton>order to make that last.
Now some people are like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24911-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care about length,
I care more about weight. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24911-3
<v Ricky Horton>that can be changed if you want to.
So how do you look at it when you guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24911-4
<v Ricky Horton>saw that you were off on your material
handling?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24915-0
<v Ricky Horton>When do you change? Get beat,
slow or move?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24936-0
<v Ricky Horton>It varies by project,
but for the heavier jobs we did it by</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24936-1
<v Ricky Horton>week. OK,
but but you changed the category move or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24936-2
<v Ricky Horton>you changed all three categories?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24975-0
<v Ricky Horton>You just say I just not just you can't
have. They just have more hours. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24975-1
<v Ricky Horton>so handling is in another person, but no.
But what he's saying is cool. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/24975-2
<v Ricky Horton>handling, but get piece moved,
load unload could be considered handling.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25025-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which one of those factors we can change?
We didn't change that. We didn't change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25025-1
<v Ricky Horton>Don't change.
That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25025-2
<v Ricky Horton>He did it manually, isn't you?
This was what the estimate was given and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25025-3
<v Ricky Horton>then he looked at it and their last
minute was short. So then it was added to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25025-4
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, so you didn't change it in here.
You changed it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25057-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's so what you could really do.
What I'm hearing is if we update it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25057-1
<v Ricky Horton>if it was the way dependent or like
dependent,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25057-2
<v Ricky Horton>if you mess with get piece login,
it will carry your lessons in the future.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25057-3
<v Ricky Horton>Have you guys done that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25100-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So we have,
we have to link it loading stuffs on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25100-1
<v Ricky Horton>saw and then if it gets,
we get it and get some pieces different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25100-2
<v Ricky Horton>When you move into the shop,
length has to be to do with the panel and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25100-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's hard because we are a top shop,
so product specific.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25100-4
<v Ricky Horton>Some of these can have three different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25108-0
<v Ricky Horton>It up inspection depending on you know
how entropy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25108-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's really hard to kind of just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25145-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
change it in one area when it varies so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25145-1
<v Ricky Horton>so different, right.
So that's where what I was looking at was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25145-2
<v Ricky Horton>like we're going to be doing an operation
that requires a certain piece of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25145-3
<v Ricky Horton>equipment.
Do we add it into that equipment time?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25183-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or otherwise we have to make a specific
chart.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25183-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean estimators have to go into adding
next amount of handling for this or move</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25183-2
<v Ricky Horton>for this or whatever.
So that doesn't seem very efficient.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25183-3
<v Ricky Horton>Let's dig into that a little bit more, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25200-0
<v Ricky Horton>You you're saying that just changing the
time here would not be good because it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25200-1
<v Ricky Horton>would vary so much like give me a give me
a example.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25207-0
<v Ricky Horton>What would make it change on a job on a
job basis?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25256-0
<v Ricky Horton>It could be the intricacy of it.
So we have some beams in the shop that if</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25256-1
<v Ricky Horton>we just did it by weight,
it may not actually work out in our favor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25256-2
<v Ricky Horton>We have a multi-step fit and Weld column,
so I have to fit and Weld this area</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25256-3
<v Ricky Horton>before I can add the secondary phase to
fit and Weld.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25293-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I'll make up to seeing additional
handling time because of the stop start</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25293-1
<v Ricky Horton>of a fitted Weld, you know, as an example,
just for additional handling that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25293-2
<v Ricky Horton>wouldn't necessarily equate back into
like a weight, you're you're saying OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25333-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've got parts on this size side of the
column,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25333-1
<v Ricky Horton>parts on this side of the column and
because of that I should have more</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25333-2
<v Ricky Horton>handling time,
specific to how long our shop is set. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25333-3
<v Ricky Horton>And so it it does that because it gets,
it puts handling on the parts as well as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25333-4
<v Ricky Horton>the main piece as well. So it does.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25335-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do that so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25365-0
<v Ricky Horton>In in general,
I would just change the the handling in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25365-1
<v Ricky Horton>here in order to make it go up.
The more parts you got,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25365-2
<v Ricky Horton>the more handling you got,
which is the case and that's what it does.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25365-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if you go through and change it then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25366-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25406-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is some channels we want to run on our
ACPC and then some we don't because if</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25406-1
<v Ricky Horton>they're just straight cuts,
it makes so much more sense to run on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25406-2
<v Ricky Horton>saw, right?
But your handling is gonna be so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25406-3
<v Ricky Horton>different,
drastically different handling it on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25406-4
<v Ricky Horton>ACPC machine versus.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25449-0
<v Ricky Horton>At the sum.
So how would you the point and that's my</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25449-1
<v Ricky Horton>question.
Can you attach handling for unique</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25449-2
<v Ricky Horton>handling for operation or for? You can,
but the the fact of the matter is that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25449-3
<v Ricky Horton>the point of the estimate,
you have no clue where you'll go, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25449-4
<v Ricky Horton>So you almost have to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can dictate that. Once we have that,
yeah, we know where we want to send it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-1
<v Ricky Horton>If if it's got no holes,
I mean it's got if it's literally just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-2
<v Ricky Horton>straight,
that's we're sending it to the salon 90%</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-3
<v Ricky Horton>of the time.
But like you're saying in the beginning,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-4
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
you aren't estimating you're done for the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25488-5
<v Ricky Horton>care book. You run it. Yeah,
as long as it's recovery.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25529-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
you you either are going to take an</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25529-1
<v Ricky Horton>average of that over time.
I know the average is somebody are going</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25529-2
<v Ricky Horton>to be here,
somebody are going to be here and you get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25529-3
<v Ricky Horton>an average for that and and apply it or
some some shops will just say I'm taking</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25529-4
<v Ricky Horton>the worst case scenario and if I if I go
over to the other machine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25571-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a savings for me.
So I'll put that down for our action</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25571-1
<v Ricky Horton>items.
Our lab money this year didn't get around</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25571-2
<v Ricky Horton>to it. Yeah,
I wouldn't build it so that if I cut it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25571-3
<v Ricky Horton>here, it's going to be this time.
If I cut it here this time,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25571-4
<v Ricky Horton>because you're just not going to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25589-0
<v Ricky Horton>That at the estimate level. So, yeah,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25589-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you have to build an average into it.
So you just have to, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25626-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is the concept of first and second fit
system the software? I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25626-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can back build anything you want.
So are you talking about like a super</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25626-2
<v Ricky Horton>assembly where you've got,
you've got basically assemblies within it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25626-3
<v Ricky Horton>that make up a larger assembly?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25657-0
<v Ricky Horton>Translate structural.
Like if you're throwing flat plates on,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25657-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's easy. First,
but now you're going to try to make</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25657-2
<v Ricky Horton>something more complicated.
That's like putting two big columns</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25657-3
<v Ricky Horton>together, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25694-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think they'll create routes based
off of our review.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25694-1
<v Ricky Horton>So if we come across a project that has a
multi-step fitment well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25694-2
<v Ricky Horton>they'll designate or create a new routes
project specific to where you have state</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25694-3
<v Ricky Horton>one fit well, then you go and tailor it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25727-0
<v Ricky Horton>They should be well and then they can
carry that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25727-1
<v Ricky Horton>But is the labor factor set up in the
system to handle the the the labor is is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25727-2
<v Ricky Horton>100% customizable.
You can make it that way if you want to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25727-3
<v Ricky Horton>by default it's looking at.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25771-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everything on a part by part basis.
So if I put a shear tab on a column,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25771-1
<v Ricky Horton>then I've got fit up for that particular
shear tab.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25771-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now if I've got 2 columns that then I'm
going to Weld together into a double</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25771-3
<v Ricky Horton>column or something, then no, that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25808-0
<v Ricky Horton>I could build something for that if it's
a common thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25808-1
<v Ricky Horton>but if it's not a common thing,
I wouldn't build a legal thing for that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25808-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, separate assemblies,
because if you tell Techlove that it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25808-3
<v Ricky Horton>each its own assembly,
it's not going to understand that it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25808-4
<v Ricky Horton>needs to be over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25849-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just created in the setting where it has
all of those on. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25849-1
<v Ricky Horton>you could and that's what I'm saying.
The answer is yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25849-2
<v Ricky Horton>it will handle that out-of-the-box with 0
customization of anything.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25849-3
<v Ricky Horton>There's not one in there that's gonna
handle that type thing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25849-4
<v Ricky Horton>But if I'm doing that type of stuff all
the time where I've got that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25871-0
<v Ricky Horton>Double fit up, basically. Oh yeah,
I can build that in it for sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25871-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just wonder what the estimates here
know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25871-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's more they can do here than do in
the field. They don't know it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25871-3
<v Ricky Horton>so you can get off quicker.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25894-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
the estimating is extremely customizable,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25894-1
<v Ricky Horton>so you can build really about whatever
you want to in there. So yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25896-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25917-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's really the beauty of it,
but it's the it it it makes it harder to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25917-1
<v Ricky Horton>implement, right? Because it's like,
I mean, it's still.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25933-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why shapes and sizes aren't just stand
that that's to me,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25933-1
<v Ricky Horton>just it's not as frustrated. I mean,
it isn't doesn't make sense quite.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25953-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean you mean like my one detailer use
A500-B and another one A500-GR dot B and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25953-1
<v Ricky Horton>see even that I feel like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25961-0
<v Ricky Horton>If they were using exactly the lean
method, right? But yeah, our.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25999-0
<v Ricky Horton>That club was already set up on a
standard and obviously when you go to the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25999-1
<v Ricky Horton>important it's telling you pay,
you know it's only A500 or A500B whatever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25999-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you could just make that one simple
adjustment. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/25999-3
<v Ricky Horton>every time you see that it needs to be
this A.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26000-0
<v Ricky Horton>100.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26049-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it it just gets so granular where
it'll have the size to be different where</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26049-1
<v Ricky Horton>they'll put instead of a four by 6,
they put a 6 by 4 and a half. Yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26049-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think a lot of companies have a
standard, but it's a standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26084-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is how we do it.
Everybody must do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26084-1
<v Ricky Horton>The person that actually doesn't locks
that thing down because otherwise you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26084-2
<v Ricky Horton>have what you sounds like you guys have.
The reality is most detailers don't know</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26084-3
<v Ricky Horton>what it should be,
and so they'll put it in as a four by 6</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26084-4
<v Ricky Horton>rather than a 6 by 46 by 4 is the
standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26085-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26086-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26111-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need to order this. Oh,
that doesn't exist. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26111-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then I have to go back to our PES,
our engineers and say this doesn't exist.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26111-2
<v Ricky Horton>We wanted it to. Yeah,
so we we have a whole.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26144-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
the details and the standards and the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26144-1
<v Ricky Horton>details.
So that's something you might be able to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26144-2
<v Ricky Horton>look,
but I agree that we need to have set</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26144-3
<v Ricky Horton>standard cannot. It has to be this way.
That's it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26184-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's how you solve those problems.
We just deal with it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26184-1
<v Ricky Horton>You get 4 characters here, 2 characters,
2 characters. I mean, it's to that level.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26184-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's character to character.
It's perfect.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26184-3
<v Ricky Horton>We don't have standard detailing
standards. We do. We have all the details.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26193-0
<v Ricky Horton>If I look at it, well,
they're about Carday.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26193-1
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody has to fix that.
We'll be living with it forever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26209-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ingredients. Look,
you're screwing this up. You got, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26209-1
<v Ricky Horton>when you got like a dozen,
there's six of them per time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26240-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they're third party. Yeah. Yeah,
at least they want the standard from the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26240-1
<v Ricky Horton>other. Yes. Yeah,
I signed that straight on up here earlier.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26240-2
<v Ricky Horton>I have the ability,
but it's only the last one of those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26257-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's not you know going back to like
like you're handling.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26257-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do you do you manipulate all the time?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26290-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say, yeah, that's a good investment.
We should probably think about changing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26290-1
<v Ricky Horton>it in here.
You don't have to change it here in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26290-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate. You guys know how to do that.
Well, us personally, no,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26290-3
<v Ricky Horton>we can take a dive if we can help out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26312-0
<v Ricky Horton>You don't want to look at how to do it.
So before you get out of here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26312-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't get out of here. Yeah, go back,
go back in there a second.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26314-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26326-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, close that.
I wanna go to view labor operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26352-0
<v Ricky Horton>You leave that open to go to the drop
down at the very top labor standards,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26352-1
<v Ricky Horton>maintenance and go to view labor
operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26352-2
<v Ricky Horton>Never set that side by side with the with
the labor standards, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26382-0
<v Ricky Horton>Never change this without knowing this
extrapolation pattern because I if I'm</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26382-1
<v Ricky Horton>looking at like the one in the 15 minutes
for that team, OK, is that 15 minutes?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26428-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like your load here is varies directly by
length. Cool. So that's 15 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26428-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's my length? Well,
my length is 40 foot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26428-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that's what I'm thinking about.
I'm thinking about putting that 15</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26428-3
<v Ricky Horton>minutes.
I'm thinking what's 40 footer will take</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26428-4
<v Ricky Horton>me because it's varies by length.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26473-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas if it doesn't vary,
I'll just change it to whatever, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26473-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't matter.
So you got to know your extrapolation</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26473-2
<v Ricky Horton>back to whatever you're whatever you're
changing your times. So is it linear? Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26473-3
<v Ricky Horton>So a 20 footer is 7 1/2 minutes, correct?
Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26473-4
<v Ricky Horton>So you put it in your estimate a 20
footer of that you're going to get.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26475-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's in that, you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26496-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26527-0
<v Ricky Horton>So in a sense,
it doesn't matter what your standard</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26527-1
<v Ricky Horton>length is,
it's just a factor to get a rate is all</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26527-2
<v Ricky Horton>that is now.
So if we were going to adjust the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26527-3
<v Ricky Horton>handling,
you're talking what would you consider</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26527-4
<v Ricky Horton>handling?
You consider unloading and loading.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26574-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm talking about unload, get piece,
load all these moves that are down</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26574-1
<v Ricky Horton>through here.
You see where the clips move,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26574-2
<v Ricky Horton>you see plate welded move.
There's a lot of stuff there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26574-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you need to that that has to be
figured is there's a lot of those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26613-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's factors in there that need to be
changed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26613-1
<v Ricky Horton>So if you came to me and said Ricky,
our handling is 15% low across the board</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26613-2
<v Ricky Horton>in general,
I'd probably start out by just going to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26613-3
<v Ricky Horton>unload, bump that up about 15 minutes,
go and get me, not 15 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26646-0
<v Ricky Horton>15% go to get piece, bump it up by 15%.
Anything that that hits a handling factor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26646-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to bump up by 15% and then I'm
going to pass that to all of them,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26646-2
<v Ricky Horton>all of the like shapes.
Does that make sense?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26689-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.
And you can see there's like the reason</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26689-1
<v Ricky Horton>why we do so many investments. I mean,
there's a lot of 0 sums there, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26689-2
<v Ricky Horton>While the, you know what I mean?
Chat is also part of our standard EISC,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26689-3
<v Ricky Horton>just typical shot, right? Look at,
look at welded clips move.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26710-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or, excuse me, weld eclipse layout. Well,
that doesn't even make a whole lot of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26710-1
<v Ricky Horton>sense. Go to the plate welded.
Go to the plate welded layout on the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26710-2
<v Ricky Horton>operations here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26758-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right.
You see that the extrapolation go one</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26758-1
<v Ricky Horton>more down 13. There you go.
See the extrapolation factors varies</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26758-2
<v Ricky Horton>directly by the number of holes in a
standard clip.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26758-3
<v Ricky Horton>Look at the number of holes in a standard
clip up there for the two. It's zero.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26758-4
<v Ricky Horton>That's why we got no time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26803-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because that extrapolation factor,
they probably pulled from AB to say,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26803-1
<v Ricky Horton>look at the number of holes in a standard
clip. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26803-2
<v Ricky Horton>the number of holes in a standard clip in
a tube is not really a thing, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26803-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you can see the holes in a standard
clip is 0.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26803-4
<v Ricky Horton>So that's really where the extrapolation.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26811-0
<v Ricky Horton>Factor for these tubes be looked at,
readjustment, put new time on so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26825-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's a lot of power here.
There's a lot here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26825-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm hearing is we don't use a lot of
this time. Is that right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26830-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not that big, big Dome.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26875-0
<v Ricky Horton>In my opinion,
I think it's that we don't utilize it to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26875-1
<v Ricky Horton>So let's say we look at the job that's
here building box meetings.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26875-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is it built with this power or are you
adjusting it at the end or how's that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26875-3
<v Ricky Horton>Do you like this very specific job that
you're doing right now?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26906-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's estimated intact.
That's a good question. Interesting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26906-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know about that.
That's pretty much all that all that box</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26906-2
<v Ricky Horton>project. I did a manual tape off.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26944-0
<v Ricky Horton>My manual take off and I went put it into
the system and then I called the precon</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26944-1
<v Ricky Horton>and click the review based off of my
physical experiences here with the shot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26944-2
<v Ricky Horton>So knowing our capabilities are happening
process that may not be what our data may</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26944-3
<v Ricky Horton>show because again it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26975-0
<v Ricky Horton>And skewed based off of shopping,
I can get it, but again,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26975-1
<v Ricky Horton>what you really want. Yeah,
100% is it to run through,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26975-2
<v Ricky Horton>to run through technical with all those
steps in there. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/26975-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's something checking the time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27020-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's to do stuff and bring it back to
tech. So we do time studies,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27020-1
<v Ricky Horton>you do time studies and then no time
studies getting input into your then the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27020-2
<v Ricky Horton>the information from those time studies
all the time study is accessible through</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27020-3
<v Ricky Horton>our work packages because we do a one for
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27020-4
<v Ricky Horton>So that and we'll run based off of that
activity. Yeah, it'll show.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27060-0
<v Ricky Horton>So then the the last part of that is
after you show an open one,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27060-1
<v Ricky Horton>does somebody go in to here and update it?
No, that's the stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27060-2
<v Ricky Horton>But it's probably need to, right? OK,
got it. The whole thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27060-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if somebody say it's a trust
and verify system, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27088-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because if you don't do it,
you'll be finding this with the rest of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27088-1
<v Ricky Horton>your life.
Each overrun has to be looked at in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27088-2
<v Ricky Horton>detail as to what was really wrong.
So if there's if they go over and we go</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27088-3
<v Ricky Horton>back and review and find out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-0
<v Ricky Horton>Something happened out of the ordinary
and we don't take it. Yeah, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's like everything was perfect and we
went over just that's your thought.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's nothing there.
That's the part that we have to be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-3
<v Ricky Horton>careful on. Yeah,
it is gatekeeping that and making a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-4
<v Ricky Horton>determination of,
but it's time saves and the day you take</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27141-5
<v Ricky Horton>the time saves.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27178-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they're in here.
That really needs to be done by you guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27178-1
<v Ricky Horton>here, not by the estimates, right?
Because you guys are the ones that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27178-2
<v Ricky Horton>actually know it took this much to do
this. And here we probably, yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27178-3
<v Ricky Horton>we we have the historical status of the
background we already only have is the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27220-0
<v Ricky Horton>The change in the data, yeah,
my own point is it's not something that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27220-1
<v Ricky Horton>you have to be able to do.
It's something you have to be done here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27220-2
<v Ricky Horton>because you guys have the knowledge the
activator does.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27220-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would say though our our one key point
is project closeout. So if.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27260-0
<v Ricky Horton>We typically don't do that unless I'm
enorrhaging and here's why.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27260-1
<v Ricky Horton>But if it's on the head or under,
if it's never, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27260-2
<v Ricky Horton>you don't have to vote.
I think you're a very good estimator.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27260-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I predict.
I think you're a very good estimator.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27260-4
<v Ricky Horton>You've probably done this for a lot of
years.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27313-0
<v Ricky Horton>The guys that are in may be pretty new
and they've probably got to ask a few</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27313-1
<v Ricky Horton>1000 questions.
They may never even step in the shop.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27313-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're counting on you to have the data
because they can say one of these three</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27313-3
<v Ricky Horton>of these, four of these,
and these six of these done. Data is good,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27313-4
<v Ricky Horton>done. It's your brain.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27337-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's in that system and that's what we're
trying to get to. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27337-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's to make it not to do really.
And I bet you got lots of time to do this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27337-2
<v Ricky Horton>here. They they've been.
I don't think the estimate has access to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27337-3
<v Ricky Horton>this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27397-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's that's what we own it. That's good.
We own it. That's it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27397-1
<v Ricky Horton>I personally believe all that should go
out and spend an hour or two in the shop,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27397-2
<v Ricky Horton>three weeks, an hour or two in the field.
So they they were really good at what it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27397-3
<v Ricky Horton>takes to do ****. Yeah,
every shop I've looked at,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27397-4
<v Ricky Horton>I've always put that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27428-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because they need to know.
They need to at least see it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27428-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's only for now. We need to say, oh, oh,
now I understand why we have to take this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27428-2
<v Ricky Horton>long to do this.
Because I'm sitting here watching them do</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27428-3
<v Ricky Horton>it, you know,
the estimators are going to deal for it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27428-4
<v Ricky Horton>but the work is being stuck here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27483-0
<v Ricky Horton>One thing we could do right here,
by the way, with all those zeros, HSS,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27483-1
<v Ricky Horton>if we would go back and look at it,
every single tube has holes and standard</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27483-2
<v Ricky Horton>clip of two.
So if we wanted to make this match what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27483-3
<v Ricky Horton>HSS is right now,
we can deliver the land at the holes and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27483-4
<v Ricky Horton>standard clip and make everything too.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27520-0
<v Ricky Horton>Repass the plan and then these will get
filled in with what's currently on HSS,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27520-1
<v Ricky Horton>which may or may not be right,
but that would make it the same if we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27520-2
<v Ricky Horton>wanted to do that.
So we just change it here. So go,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27520-3
<v Ricky Horton>go to the drop and see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27523-0
<v Ricky Horton>The top one, Bill, it holds the same.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27528-0
<v Ricky Horton>So again, just SSHSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27533-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then OK at the bottom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27570-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now we'll get back to HSS and it will
redo what takes off of this whole,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27570-1
<v Ricky Horton>she said.
It's live whether it's right or not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27573-0
<v Ricky Horton>You need to go to HSS first.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27597-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's something because you see all those
have times for layout,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27597-1
<v Ricky Horton>feed out and whatnot there.
So now you do blood blended operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27600-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there we go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27607-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do you mean?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27628-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not there. Oh, that's right.
They do feel any shots.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27628-1
<v Ricky Horton>So now this is HSS should get more times
in those other fields. There you go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27645-0
<v Ricky Horton>And these to us, maybe shot.
So it's like really updating where it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27645-1
<v Ricky Horton>says it's something old in there,
but all they do is good job doesn't just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27645-2
<v Ricky Horton>make the document.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27669-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the one of the next two is the chart</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27669-1
<v Ricky Horton>right here where it says I'm gonna put
those back together. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27669-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can change that. Yeah,
we can change it all that. Um, no,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27669-3
<v Ricky Horton>unless we recap stuff on that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27700-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
so you went through and changed that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27700-1
<v Ricky Horton>whole. Truthfully,
what I would probably do is change the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27700-2
<v Ricky Horton>stripolation factors based off of the
holes in the state of the clip because</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27700-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's really not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27746-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's really not the right, right thing.
I I think what they did originally was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27746-1
<v Ricky Horton>they took the they built the beams which
made sense for like the welder clips to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27746-2
<v Ricky Horton>be based off the holes of the center clip
on a beat, right? The bigger the clip,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27746-3
<v Ricky Horton>the more time I'll have to play it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27781-0
<v Ricky Horton>But and then they just kind of said,
let's mimic that for twos.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27781-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't really. I mean,
you're not sure you might every once in a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27781-2
<v Ricky Horton>while live on a on a on a two,
but not often, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27781-3
<v Ricky Horton>So are we looking at the can?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27822-0
<v Ricky Horton>Numbers here from PowerPoint.
I don't let you know if you change that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27822-1
<v Ricky Horton>at all. I'm not sure.
We'll have to go back and compare.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27822-2
<v Ricky Horton>The 12 minutes looks familiar to me and
move 18 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27822-3
<v Ricky Horton>I wouldn't doubt that it was out of box.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27860-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I'll I'll say this about the
out-of-the-box times. By the way,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27860-1
<v Ricky Horton>normally when I go to somebody that's
fresh with this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27860-2
<v Ricky Horton>the main things that I'll change are well
times are generally very slow in here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27860-3
<v Ricky Horton>Burn times need to change because
technology has changed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27889-0
<v Ricky Horton>Handling gets manipulated,
but the layout fit up are generally</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27889-1
<v Ricky Horton>pretty close in the ballpark.
The cutting times a lot of times are just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27889-2
<v Ricky Horton>little alert,
but most of the time the layout fit up is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27889-3
<v Ricky Horton>not too awful bad.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27936-0
<v Ricky Horton>If I were to,
if I didn't know what my shop was doing</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27936-1
<v Ricky Horton>and somebody told me that, it's like,
what should I adjust here?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27936-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say let's go change our weld times
and let's run with it. And honestly,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27936-3
<v Ricky Horton>that's what I do a lot to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27971-0
<v Ricky Horton>To evaluate the labor here versus what
they're estimating,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27971-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll change the well times and then let's
grow an estimate and see where it ends</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27971-2
<v Ricky Horton>and a lot of times we're in the zip code.
We're probably within 10% of where they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/27971-3
<v Ricky Horton>want to be. So how easy is this?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28000-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say we finish a job, any job,
and we will close out and we have the O</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28000-1
<v Ricky Horton>bridges. You go in and update everything.
I assume you can now run the model back</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28000-2
<v Ricky Horton>through estimated to do a checksum.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28038-0
<v Ricky Horton>You could,
you could run it back through there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28038-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you have to have.
So these labor standards are built into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28038-2
<v Ricky Horton>what's called a land code, a labor code.
Think of it as a recipe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28038-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's all your ingredients right there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28090-0
<v Ricky Horton>And the labor code says this these are
ingredients, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28090-1
<v Ricky Horton>So all the pieces have to have a labor
code on us and the system knows what what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28090-2
<v Ricky Horton>hours to apply to it, right.
So if the system says it's got a 16,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28090-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to grab whatever line 16 says.
Yes, yes, correct. I get that. So,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28090-4
<v Ricky Horton>so when you bring if you were to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28123-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pour the bottle into estimating.
You still have to put the proper labor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28123-1
<v Ricky Horton>codes on it in order to see what labor.
But yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28123-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can because my goal would be like the
last three jobs.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28149-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I don't care if they're over,
under or whatever. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28149-1
<v Ricky Horton>And I would run them back through to see
if they estimated correctly for each</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28149-2
<v Ricky Horton>operation.
Then I know that my database was behaving,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28149-3
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28151-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you push for morning.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28163-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know he he does the your checkup on
the job more broad than that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28169-0
<v Ricky Horton>We we do postmortem this project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28205-0
<v Ricky Horton>Lots of grass and we made a lot of money.
You got this report. So what do you get?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28205-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think we all,
we all did those reports too,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28205-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I think all I say for us we never
went back and updated the standard and so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28237-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. We just got to do that. Yeah,
I've done that. Look,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28237-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're welding rates this this many
minutes for you to fix it right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28237-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's over. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28283-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably should for you. Well,
I think you're about to kill this box</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28283-1
<v Ricky Horton>being done. You're about to kill it,
right? And you said it's a 3000 hour.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28283-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what the number is and it's
going to take 2000,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28283-3
<v Ricky Horton>so much different number, right?
And it's probably because you did 28 of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28283-4
<v Ricky Horton>them and you learned a lot of little ****.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-0
<v Ricky Horton>Along the way,
switching process from manual analog to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-1
<v Ricky Horton>cell part. So you know,
things like that may be progressing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
beating based off of our manual load time</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-3
<v Ricky Horton>versus because you don't necessarily want
to change it because you might not have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-4
<v Ricky Horton>to clear the new method and might have to
read it exactly. But again,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28336-5
<v Ricky Horton>I do think you want to change it because.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28365-0
<v Ricky Horton>The sub arc welding is a new operation
that is totally going to change the game</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28365-1
<v Ricky Horton>of how you did that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28378-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, because if the FC Maker sees,
I got 28 of these,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28378-1
<v Ricky Horton>he can choose to run somewhere around.
Yeah, it will be done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28384-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
it's a pretty good definitely too, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28413-0
<v Ricky Horton>And now I I talked through how to change
this. Do you want to change one? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28413-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's go back to the labor standards over
here on the right here and click on that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28445-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if we want to check.
We could take like you're not using PX,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28445-1
<v Ricky Horton>right?
We can change PX without screwing up</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28445-2
<v Ricky Horton>anything just to show you how to make
sure you know how to change it so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28456-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so let's say that we wanted to bump up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28504-0
<v Ricky Horton>Handling by 10%.
There's a bunch of items here that are</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28504-1
<v Ricky Horton>considered handling.
So like unload is currently at 12 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28504-2
<v Ricky Horton>So and this is like Rob Russian.
I just want handle going by 10%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28504-3
<v Ricky Horton>Cool at that point.
I'm not sure I care what the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28504-4
<v Ricky Horton>extrapolation factor is.
I'm just going to take all the times.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28522-0
<v Ricky Horton>So so now there we would need what 13.
2 is that correct? So change it to 13.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28522-1
<v Ricky Horton>2 say only for PS18.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28562-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.
And then we'll change it on PX18 and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28562-1
<v Ricky Horton>we'll pass the all the others,
all the other PX, but not to the WTS,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28562-2
<v Ricky Horton>correct, correct.
We'll be able to choose that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28562-3
<v Ricky Horton>So they're going to get paid to do the
same things.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28568-0
<v Ricky Horton>Change it to no,
just go down to get piece over here on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28568-1
<v Ricky Horton>the right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28576-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, right there. Change that to 13.2.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28608-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go to move down there. Well,
load would be the next one I guess, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28608-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that would be we're adding a minute
and a half to that. So 16.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28608-2
<v Ricky Horton>5 move then is going to go up to 19.8,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28640-0
<v Ricky Horton>You have the idea, right?
Then you would go to the, well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28640-1
<v Ricky Horton>the clips move, the plate building move,
so I'll set for it all the way down and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28640-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're looking, right? Yep. OK,
so the moves are not 12 is not related to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28640-3
<v Ricky Horton>seven.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28693-0
<v Ricky Horton>Correct. Yes.
So you got to move general overall,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28693-1
<v Ricky Horton>but then the welded clips move would be
the clip itself. I'm going to go get it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28693-2
<v Ricky Horton>So, so I assume we did all that right.
We went there and did move all the way</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28693-3
<v Ricky Horton>down. So now you know we got 1/8 fixed.
We're going to pass that to everybody.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28699-0
<v Ricky Horton>Things.
So now we're going up to the drop down at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28699-1
<v Ricky Horton>the top, global ended operations.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28747-0
<v Ricky Horton>We had 1/8 selected,
so now let's pull over PX.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28747-1
<v Ricky Horton>Notice 1/8 is not included over here
because we're passing from 1/8 to then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28747-2
<v Ricky Horton>yes. So we'll say OK,
now we're going to pull over the unload,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28747-3
<v Ricky Horton>get piece, move.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28751-0
<v Ricky Horton>All those things that we want to affect,
yeah, load.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
And we would have done all the other</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28780-1
<v Ricky Horton>moves, right?
Hit OK and now that has just had all the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28780-2
<v Ricky Horton>other sizes. So I've got a question.
What's the column being here? W 1240?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28780-3
<v Ricky Horton>What about the column?
Give us something to the column.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28785-0
<v Ricky Horton>WB. Can you pull up the W8 by 24?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28822-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right.
I think you're using out-of-the-box stuff</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28822-1
<v Ricky Horton>for all your operations. Those 12 minutes.
I think that's out-of-the-box.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28822-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let me look here. I can tell you.
I just want to see if they've been</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28822-3
<v Ricky Horton>changed. They haven't been changed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28862-0
<v Ricky Horton>Eight at 24, so we've got 1212.
Well now cut is 6.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28862-1
<v Ricky Horton>68 out-of-the-box paints 14.981501853.757.
52.63 so it looks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28868-0
<v Ricky Horton>Kind of what I'm seeing.
Everything's out-of-the-box except cut</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28868-1
<v Ricky Horton>has been changed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28883-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's why the sense I get is we're not
really using the database 'cause it feels</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28883-1
<v Ricky Horton>like we're not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28888-0
<v Ricky Horton>Other practice too,
like unload how it comes in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28893-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have no, no control over that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28942-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are they interlocked? You know, are they?
Are they separated with dunnage?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28942-1
<v Ricky Horton>Big difference. Massive. Well,
that's definitely one of the things that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28942-2
<v Ricky Horton>drives me crazy. For example,
in ponies we start,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28942-3
<v Ricky Horton>we start doing estimates on blasting and
you say, OK, the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28979-0
<v Ricky Horton>The wheel greater can run so many feet
per minute.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28979-1
<v Ricky Horton>If this wheel comes in at this grade,
it doesn't come in,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28979-2
<v Ricky Horton>it can take hats to run slower,
but you have no control over that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/28979-3
<v Ricky Horton>So the estimated will go in the middle of
getting an average.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29010-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. And it's like you're still gambling.
You really are. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29010-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's just no way you can notice some
of that stuff up at the estimate level.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29010-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you almost have to just say
historically, yeah, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29010-3
<v Ricky Horton>you're an average or a high average. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29051-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think something that's not going to
allow here is they they estimate it a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29051-1
<v Ricky Horton>certain way and it comes in and stacks of
inner dogs, you know, like ****,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29051-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're screwed.
That's not that is to be notated in the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29051-3
<v Ricky Horton>jobs somewhere.
So do we make adjustments to it? No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29051-4
<v Ricky Horton>go to this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29067-0
<v Ricky Horton>The number of is specific and you know,
but when you say it comes in,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29067-1
<v Ricky Horton>are you saying how do you bought it from
Brown and Strauss? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29072-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can't you control our brand of Cows
Prince to you?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29119-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know you've said that,
but if virus screws me,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29119-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to Samuel.
I'll go to whoever until they comply with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29119-2
<v Ricky Horton>the way I want to get it.
I think they're under the same notion</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29119-3
<v Ricky Horton>with us. They have a second criteria here.
Why would I spend 10 hours living this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29119-4
<v Ricky Horton>when I can spend 2 interlock it and you
hear everything on your.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29162-0
<v Ricky Horton>Time to, you know what I mean? So hey,
can we make the request? Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29162-1
<v Ricky Horton>But then we're also driven by their
deliverables and I may get a release</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29162-2
<v Ricky Horton>today that I need to procure order and
how about my next Monday? So I get it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29162-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know what I mean? So,
but I think it's percent, it's 80%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29198-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're going to create a way that it is
standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29198-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's going to be the 20% or whatever
oddballs and I I wouldn't exactly sweat</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29198-2
<v Ricky Horton>those until they started moving the
needle.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29198-3
<v Ricky Horton>But I think these times you got to build
up for the 80% and basically you got to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29198-4
<v Ricky Horton>build it and you got to build it for the
average guy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29245-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, Ryan, you got your A guys, you guys,
you got a building for your average guys.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29245-1
<v Ricky Horton>That is why the postmortem is really nice
to have to to be and say, OK, cool,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29245-2
<v Ricky Horton>we we find on the last three jobs,
we are blowing it on unloading or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29245-3
<v Ricky Horton>whatever you you you pick,
pick your metric, we're blowing it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29283-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now we're going to update these. I,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29283-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll go to some shops and they'll want to
adjust all their labor based off of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29283-2
<v Ricky Horton>looking at one assembly. No, no, no, no,
no.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29283-3
<v Ricky Horton>Do 123 jobs and see if you see a tree and
if so, then now we'll go change it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29327-0
<v Ricky Horton>And do it on a macro level rather than a
micro level,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29327-1
<v Ricky Horton>which is kind of why I I kind of said OK,
handling these go up by 10%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29327-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that I'm going to fight too
much over whether it's plate welded move</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29327-3
<v Ricky Horton>or not. You know,
I'm just going to say all of it's going,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29327-4
<v Ricky Horton>you know, because.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29330-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29332-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's the 80%, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29364-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it and if we have those numbers,
I think they have, we can,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29364-1
<v Ricky Horton>we can make some changes here. Yeah,
I think it's a little database that needs</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29364-2
<v Ricky Horton>to have here, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29411-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's really pretty easy to change.
It's just you got to know what to change</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29411-1
<v Ricky Horton>and you got to know what it is.
What's your?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29411-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are you a good data base user?
I have a good data base user.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29411-3
<v Ricky Horton>Like if you were to go on,
these guys have got 100,000 things to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
I don't know what we're doing yet. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-1
<v Ricky Horton>I got a pretty good idea. I'm getting it.
I think we need to be the ones having the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-2
<v Ricky Horton>data because I think it'll help me learn.
I got enough data. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-3
<v Ricky Horton>mine's outbased team,
but I've been doing it since. I get it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-4
<v Ricky Horton>I see it since 79 and I started sweeping
the shop and everything,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29467-5
<v Ricky Horton>which I'm going to say.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29531-0
<v Ricky Horton>This dollar is ********. That's right.
I didn't even say that. You're right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29531-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've been to other shops and and even
more metal shops. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29531-2
<v Ricky Horton>stainless aluminum and brass. It's like,
and I know it's either physically done or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29531-3
<v Ricky Horton>watching being done for four or five or
eight years. So yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29531-4
<v Ricky Horton>I am going to look at it as I get deeper
into the system.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29564-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we say, well, that number is ********.
That number is ********.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29564-1
<v Ricky Horton>This one needs to go up. This one needs.
I think they're asking for help.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29564-2
<v Ricky Horton>But but see,
it's the same experience that these guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29564-3
<v Ricky Horton>have because they're doing out all day.
They know what it takes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29564-4
<v Ricky Horton>I'll do whatever it takes to help the
company, whatever.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29616-0
<v Ricky Horton>Todd still asked me to do it.
He asked me to help out basically when I</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29616-1
<v Ricky Horton>was hired. Look,
I want you to help out a bunch of young</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29616-2
<v Ricky Horton>project managers since you can have me
involved in their projects and give them</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29616-3
<v Ricky Horton>feedback and can help out doing their job
and he wants to be heavily involved.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the pre-construction of the that's
what he very specifically told me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-1
<v Ricky Horton>He said, no,
I will be involved in exactly what we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-2
<v Ricky Horton>doing here.
You're going to think that should start</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-3
<v Ricky Horton>way half and anyone in the third thing
you must be involved in anything that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-4
<v Ricky Horton>going between the shop and the field.
I mean I've account all aspects of it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29664-5
<v Ricky Horton>I only do the obstruct.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's still only for six years. It's like,
yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I kind of understand all aspects of it,
but I can't do everything all at one</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-2
<v Ricky Horton>season.
But I think you understand closing the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-3
<v Ricky Horton>loop. Yeah,
and I think we need to teach these</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-4
<v Ricky Horton>project managers that when they close the
jobs out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29697-5
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know who to feed back to right
now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29733-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's why it sounds to me like these
guys here are the ones that are going to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29733-1
<v Ricky Horton>update this after the rest of the shot,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29733-2
<v Ricky Horton>So then we had to have the same
conversation with the field people</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29733-3
<v Ricky Horton>because I'm sure there must be field
superintendents or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29774-0
<v Ricky Horton>They need to be involved in the same type
of discussion regarding the field, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29774-1
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, not the field.
We have the conversation, but build this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29774-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's just shot. Well, don't be estimated.
Don't be estimate the field to use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29810-0
<v Ricky Horton>But eventually, aren't they?
Are they going to want to estimate field</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29810-1
<v Ricky Horton>hours through this as well? No, no.
If you have,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29810-2
<v Ricky Horton>you did and then you have to work. OK,
I think there's I know there's no one</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29810-3
<v Ricky Horton>that tech was not the field at all.
It's all shot. Really.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29810-4
<v Ricky Horton>They just want to be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29846-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I've been,
I've been really did use it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29846-1
<v Ricky Horton>I worked at Bragg training starting with
the rating department.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29846-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's all he did was install it.
They used it for that. It's not possible.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29846-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's just we don't do that here.
So that's fine. Why don't they do it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure I'll be involved in this. OK,
look,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-1
<v Ricky Horton>show me what program you use for your
field. Let's look at it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-2
<v Ricky Horton>Then they have to sit down with their
field superintendents or their some of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-3
<v Ricky Horton>their the perform and their key people
and say, look,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-4
<v Ricky Horton>how long does it really take to do this?
How many sticks can you put up a day of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29897-5
<v Ricky Horton>this type of work? I mean, you know,
regularly to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29917-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, the ones that operate the smoothest,
what are they doing differently?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29917-1
<v Ricky Horton>You mean like on the estimated size,
is that what you're talking about?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29955-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Are you tired of the other? Well,
that's a pretty broad question.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29955-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what do you mean?
Like the ones that are doing the best,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29955-2
<v Ricky Horton>what will operate in the smoothness?
Is that what you're saying?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29955-3
<v Ricky Horton>Are they using type of to estimate the
field,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29955-4
<v Ricky Horton>but not to estimate the field generally,
OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29992-0
<v Ricky Horton>Generally, that's outside of it.
Now I've done it when I've done it inside.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29992-1
<v Ricky Horton>But if you were to put time right here,
it's going to mix it in with the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29992-2
<v Ricky Horton>fabrication hours. No, no,
I think it's going to be separate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/29992-3
<v Ricky Horton>I in there. We need to take, OK,
here's all my shop stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now there's on my field,
so it takes as much time to set a column</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-1
<v Ricky Horton>as much time instead of being as much
time to do a brace there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-2
<v Ricky Horton>I've built it into where because I've
seen that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-3
<v Ricky Horton>I've taken one of those parametric
assemblies. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-4
<v Ricky Horton>I've done it where it's like, OK,
how many columns you got? How many?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-5
<v Ricky Horton>If it's like so much per column,
so much per being,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30057-6
<v Ricky Horton>whatever and you put it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're quantities and then it it spits
out the number.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you could build it in here,
but it's not separate labor weight for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-2
<v Ricky Horton>that too.
It's like here's my here's labor weight</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-3
<v Ricky Horton>and all the field stuff.
That's what I've seen in the past.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, OK,
so here's all the shop stuff and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-5
<v Ricky Horton>over here's my field stuff.
It's all done in the same program.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30104-6
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's pretty.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30141-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to be estimated in three
different programs. Yeah, it seems a lot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30141-1
<v Ricky Horton>What a lot of shops will do is it might
be it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30141-2
<v Ricky Horton>the field is a different critter, right?
Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30141-3
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of we'll do it in a different
one,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30141-4
<v Ricky Horton>but then bring the numbers back in here.
Sure. So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30170-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I'm I'm the ones that do it the best.
It's all-encompassing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30170-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've got my numbers in one spot. Yeah,
I I might generate some of the numbers</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30170-2
<v Ricky Horton>outside,
but I'm going to bring them back to this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30170-3
<v Ricky Horton>spot. I agree.
I think it all should be within tech.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30208-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that estimate summary would be the
place you do that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30208-1
<v Ricky Horton>bringing it into the estimate summary and
I've got my correction numbers in there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30208-2
<v Ricky Horton>whether they're calculated there or not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30252-0
<v Ricky Horton>To touch back on what Eric said,
he would be more than accepting mental</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30252-1
<v Ricky Horton>help for sure. And our plan,
what I'm thinking is first and foremost,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30252-2
<v Ricky Horton>we need to get everything else corrected
and then we need to implement sooner than</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30252-3
<v Ricky Horton>later the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30299-0
<v Ricky Horton>The constant feedback with the checks and
balances of showing your data as we move</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30299-1
<v Ricky Horton>forward on all of these items. Yeah,
but right now, if we had somebody,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30299-2
<v Ricky Horton>we'd start. I agree with you. If not,
we can't get that help.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30299-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to take this other route
where we focus on getting this stuff done</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30299-4
<v Ricky Horton>and doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30308-0
<v Ricky Horton>June.
I don't know how much time we have this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30308-1
<v Ricky Horton>week, but I would like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30330-0
<v Ricky Horton>But good job in that job. That's done.
Completed. Shop only for now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30330-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's keep the field with your stuff.
Good job in that job and we run the model.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30365-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll run it through here and see what the
estimate says it would do just on a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30365-1
<v Ricky Horton>baseline case.
So we're looking at the estimate that is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30365-2
<v Ricky Horton>apples to apples with what you actually
fabricated. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30365-3
<v Ricky Horton>the answer is and the answer is it's
within 10%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30393-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool. Then that's great.
The answer is it's something completely</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30393-1
<v Ricky Horton>different and we could probably look at
it by operation.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30393-2
<v Ricky Horton>We very quickly learn all of the data
once we work that as a standard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30428-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think life gets better.
Would it be easy to take two or three</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30428-1
<v Ricky Horton>jobs that in fact work estimated through
Tekla so that you only got to come up</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30428-2
<v Ricky Horton>with the postmortem stuff.
That's exactly what I want. Yeah, not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30428-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to be myself starting fresh.
They went through the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30428-4
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have some jobs that you're
completed that they go to a bad?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30471-0
<v Ricky Horton>That that actually were estimated within
that. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30471-1
<v Ricky Horton>we could do kind of the combination of we
got the estimate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30471-2
<v Ricky Horton>but let's literally take the IFC model,
import it back in as an S as an estimate</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30471-3
<v Ricky Horton>because if there's differences between
the estimate and the actual.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we we we kind of want to account for that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-1
<v Ricky Horton>as well, right.
You're talking about changing or because</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-2
<v Ricky Horton>all this stuff change on the job possibly.
And yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-3
<v Ricky Horton>I I don't know your your specific work,
but some shops I go to estimate there's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-4
<v Ricky Horton>going to be differences by the time we
get to fabricate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30517-5
<v Ricky Horton>but if it's very similar then we can't,
we could just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30557-0
<v Ricky Horton>One month, five months, a month,
three weeks,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30557-1
<v Ricky Horton>something about the system and how to put
that together.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30557-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then I don't know how long that's
going to take. I was hoping each day.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30595-0
<v Ricky Horton>The day we kind of look at what's gonna
happen next day,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30595-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimate how much time we have. Yep.
So if we have enough time,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30595-2
<v Ricky Horton>we can fill in Wednesday.
I really think Thursday, Wednesday,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30595-3
<v Ricky Horton>Thursday is gonna be really tied up with
the electrical stuff. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30595-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's the kind of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30631-0
<v Ricky Horton>But how do you say electrical?
How do you say electrical even? Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30631-1
<v Ricky Horton>well, let me, let me, let's get this.
I want to do what you said.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30631-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I want to figure that. Yeah,
do the easy part.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30631-3
<v Ricky Horton>I want to figure when we do it or we can
do this on Friday.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30631-4
<v Ricky Horton>We'd like to try to run a demo.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30654-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go through the podium.
So either we can do this comparison,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30654-1
<v Ricky Horton>this analysis that Eric's talking about
tomorrow eventually or Friday. So yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30654-2
<v Ricky Horton>how long does it take?
It's gonna take 10 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30701-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, that that's going to be, well,
it depends on what you want to change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30701-1
<v Ricky Horton>We just want to look at it.
We just want to look at the data.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30701-2
<v Ricky Horton>If it's an estimate's already in there,
yeah, looking at it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30701-3
<v Ricky Horton>there's nothing to it.
That's not a big real problem.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30739-0
<v Ricky Horton>As long as there's the data on the back
end to look at,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30739-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're putting it off for Friday. Yeah,
yeah, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30739-2
<v Ricky Horton>We have the ISC pod starting tomorrow,
March,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30739-3
<v Ricky Horton>and we'll kind of sign in with that.
So I'll just put it in there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30739-4
<v Ricky Horton>just send it in for Friday and I'll
resend it out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30765-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just keep in mind checks and downs.
Job close out post mortem post mortem</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30765-1
<v Ricky Horton>review Friday. My flight's at 3:40,
so I just need to be out of here in time</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30765-2
<v Ricky Horton>to get to the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30783-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going home, North Carolina. Yeah,
yeah, we want to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, yeah,
I mean that that would be great to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-1
<v Ricky Horton>If we can make some major strides there,
that would be tremendous, I think.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you get it early,
I'd love to see it earlier.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-3
<v Ricky Horton>I've got Tecla.
I want to see if I can make it. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-4
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
I think we're going to be really</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30833-5
<v Ricky Horton>surprised to see how long it can take.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30877-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know he. Yeah, he's right next to him.
Oh, he can't get to you. I asked him.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30877-1
<v Ricky Horton>He didn't.
I acted like he didn't know how to do</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30877-2
<v Ricky Horton>whatever it was. Well,
he's just advised I really ought to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30877-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'll ask him.
I bugged him Thursday and he finally got</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30877-4
<v Ricky Horton>to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30941-0
<v Ricky Horton>This morning, when I started Friday,
somebody else invited me in this week.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30941-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's it. You know,
I'll put in the request.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30941-2
<v Ricky Horton>The request got good Friday.
I sent in a second request this morning</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30941-3
<v Ricky Horton>because I didn't see a response from the
first one and all I got was, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30941-4
<v Ricky Horton>we received a request. OK, still good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30973-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll see how long it takes. Yeah,
I bugged him Friday because I haven't got</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30973-1
<v Ricky Horton>the class love that has it,
but I think somebody else can send it out</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30973-2
<v Ricky Horton>via like IT support. Yeah, send it. Oh,
I sent it like this. I sent it. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/30973-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get one. Yeah, I sent.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31019-0
<v Ricky Horton>8 feet away from the piece of office,
but I think somebody here was having a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31019-1
<v Ricky Horton>problem because he said he was working on
eight different using upgrades.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31019-2
<v Ricky Horton>It took me 3 days to get the movie and
the only bad guy was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31031-0
<v Ricky Horton>But Keith, he's that.
Give me about 2 hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31031-1
<v Ricky Horton>He did contact and saw about three months
ago and still on. Oh, nice.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31039-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then after a movie,
it took me another hour to get my mark.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31075-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now all the dropping back,
you'll have to finish out all the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31075-1
<v Ricky Horton>stainless shapes, right?
And get all those in there and everything</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31075-2
<v Ricky Horton>and make sure it pulls everything over.
But even being the stainless.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31112-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is going to be identical to identical
times to the carbon right now, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31112-1
<v Ricky Horton>So then those need to get adjusted
appropriately as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31112-2
<v Ricky Horton>So that's something that I'll have to be
thought about as well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31112-3
<v Ricky Horton>but certainly it takes a lot longer to do
a lot of that in statements than it does.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31137-0
<v Ricky Horton>In in carbon, yeah.
So far it's the material shape for each</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31137-1
<v Ricky Horton>size basically. OK,
just the point of any activators yet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31171-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like,
I know they got pretty backed up with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31171-1
<v Ricky Horton>their training last week. Yeah,
actually they did.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31171-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're probably picking up slack today.
So do you personally work with Exactly to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31171-3
<v Ricky Horton>do an estimate or are you using your
experience to do it? I'll use my.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31180-0
<v Ricky Horton>Experienced to do it and then uh, yeah,
who's our new techno Tesla?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-0
<v Ricky Horton>Coordinator, if you would, he'll input it,
do his,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-1
<v Ricky Horton>do the takeoff based off of there and
then we'll compare it from one to one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-2
<v Ricky Horton>So he's doing the takeoff,
utilizing the import files and then I'm</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-3
<v Ricky Horton>doing mine based off of physical
experience with the shop. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-4
<v Ricky Horton>And then we'll make adjustments based off
of it. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31235-5
<v Ricky Horton>So we need to get your brain there and
then, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31267-0
<v Ricky Horton>That was that was the problem in the shop
where I was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31267-1
<v Ricky Horton>I couldn't get my brother's brain 45
years of experience in this kid's head.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31267-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I took it from his head into here,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31267-3
<v Ricky Horton>And so then that kid could get the same
thing. So there's so many.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31313-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody wanted to know my brain
estimating a certain thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31313-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I always said it's always different.
And I finally just gave up and said no,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31313-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't need to worry about the special
case. That's where you get hung up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31313-3
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody does want to talk about the
fringe of stuff that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31337-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, what if?
Stop talking about the what if,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31337-1
<v Ricky Horton>get the 80% in there and there. Yeah,
it it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31337-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's hard enough to realize that this job
is more difficult than the average job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31337-3
<v Ricky Horton>and this one's a lot easier than the
average job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31337-4
<v Ricky Horton>The other way we should be able to look
that and go on to the job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31380-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I can use all the regular numbers.
There's there's what you got. Well, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31380-1
<v Ricky Horton>you've used this a little bit,
but there is what's called the efficiency</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31380-2
<v Ricky Horton>factor. So you can say, hey,
I forget what the I don't believe what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31380-3
<v Ricky Horton>you guys using efficiency.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31427-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's at 100%.
It's like bring it down to 85. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31427-1
<v Ricky Horton>I had a big argument.
They moved us to 100% efficiency. I said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31427-2
<v Ricky Horton>well,
nothing is 100% because there's always</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31427-3
<v Ricky Horton>that factor.
So are we in the decision from the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31427-4
<v Ricky Horton>standard 75 to 85? Yeah, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31461-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be more.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-0
<v Ricky Horton>Competitive,
but also I don't know who operates at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-1
<v Ricky Horton>100% anything, you know, I love it. Well,
some shops I go to,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-2
<v Ricky Horton>they'll run it at 100% because they got
their flood,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-3
<v Ricky Horton>their inefficiencies built into the
numbers in the back. That makes sense.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-4
<v Ricky Horton>So we have to use the efficiency factor.
I sat with you, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31473-5
<v Ricky Horton>like number estimated.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31507-0
<v Ricky Horton>I sat with the estimator and he said,
oh look, I have the efficiency factor.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31507-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll put in X amount.
So it adjusted this numbers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31507-2
<v Ricky Horton>Usually the guys that use the efficiency
factor,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31507-3
<v Ricky Horton>the norm is somewhere between 75 and 85%
where they generally fall.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31541-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've seen as low as 50%. So, but yeah,
I got two. Yeah, uncertain items.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31541-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to use twice as many hours as
I pay. Yeah, I think it's also the 28.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31541-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's how you play with.
There's 28 of them, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31541-3
<v Ricky Horton>You're gonna get better.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31564-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if you leave yourself 100%,
you got no room doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31564-1
<v Ricky Horton>You don't want to screw up too many.
You're going to get every job or you're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31564-2
<v Ricky Horton>going to get no jobs depending on where
you said that, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31565-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31567-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, and I guess.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31603-0
<v Ricky Horton>Question. Yeah,
based off of what we were planning for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31603-1
<v Ricky Horton>today, do well,
we didn't talk through some of this other</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31603-2
<v Ricky Horton>stuff. I was going to say,
should we grab a job or do we It seems</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31603-3
<v Ricky Horton>like we have time and it's only 2:00.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31627-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean we we we talked about,
you know how to do the aluminum and and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31627-1
<v Ricky Horton>stainless, it just has to be done, right?
And we did some of it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31627-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it just has to be done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31638-0
<v Ricky Horton>Push labor to do the added aluminum
stainless sizes. You know how to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31638-1
<v Ricky Horton>It just has to be done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31661-0
<v Ricky Horton>Add and adjust labor codes.
We didn't really talk through that a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31661-1
<v Ricky Horton>whole lot.
The codes are what labor to apply and the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31661-2
<v Ricky Horton>rates OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31710-0
<v Ricky Horton>Would be it's applicable to that.
But if this is, hey,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31710-1
<v Ricky Horton>I need a new labor code for sheer tab on
one end, clip angles on the other,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31710-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's not already in the system.
We can build customer stuff, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31710-3
<v Ricky Horton>Or we can build like a double column
labor code if we wanted to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31743-0
<v Ricky Horton>You need to get everything,
but then that means it easily won't open.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31743-1
<v Ricky Horton>The best one I can't stand.
I'm using five different spreadsheets or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31743-2
<v Ricky Horton>somebody's did this, this,
these programs like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31759-0
<v Ricky Horton>When you say here new codes exist,
but some do not generate labor correctly,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31759-1
<v Ricky Horton>you want to look at that or you have a
specific example.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31782-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we need to wait on Gavin for that.
Yeah, I think we'll OK, but I got B&amp;</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31782-1
<v Ricky Horton>C circling back of the Gavin. OK,
D talking face fill, this restriction,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31782-2
<v Ricky Horton>low pressure last time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31783-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31798-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're thinking about that one.
Which one's the visit date code? No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31798-1
<v Ricky Horton>because I don't know how they're,
how they're what?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31805-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are we running into character
restrictions on the basically?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31807-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31851-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or or a stupid question for me since I
don't have anything. Phase codes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31851-1
<v Ricky Horton>are these the operations that you're
pushing in the Vista?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31851-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's what Vista will generate from that
estimate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31851-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if we take the next floor and we have
these line items.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31892-0
<v Ricky Horton>It'll have, let's just say for instance,
if I broke that out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31892-1
<v Ricky Horton>it would have a move and labor code,
you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31892-2
<v Ricky Horton>3010 and then it would go 3010 dash,
dash one, dash two, dash three.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31892-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it's just a way that we communicate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31930-0
<v Ricky Horton>From what we're tracking to our ERP
software for financials,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31930-1
<v Ricky Horton>are you pushing Tacla to Vista or is
Vista keystroking things in or what's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31930-2
<v Ricky Horton>this?
We get the data from Vista based on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31930-3
<v Ricky Horton>export and then we translate that into
your per base code.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31959-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, correlation. Some of this,
some of this will send to Vista,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31959-1
<v Ricky Horton>some doesn't.
So like what what what can go from here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31959-2
<v Ricky Horton>into Vista are POSPO receipts,
inventory transactions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31994-0
<v Ricky Horton>Other than that,
nothing else flows automatically.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31994-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's what's first?
Do you set up a job in Vista or set up a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31994-2
<v Ricky Horton>job in Power? It it doesn't really matter.
But yeah, is that how you do it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31994-3
<v Ricky Horton>Basically,
that's how we generate the job and we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/31994-4
<v Ricky Horton>coming from that software.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32035-0
<v Ricky Horton>Beard and are the ones that set up.
So they set up this stuff and then you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32035-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys come back and do your thing. Yes Sir,
but you've done the estimate in check,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32035-2
<v Ricky Horton>correct?
But we cannot get this into the database</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32035-3
<v Ricky Horton>until we have a job number.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32039-0
<v Ricky Horton>The job number comes from a generated at
Vista.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32072-0
<v Ricky Horton>My brain is saying you estimated it in
Tekla and so you've got everything set</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32072-1
<v Ricky Horton>the way you wanted to tackle,
which should drive.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32072-2
<v Ricky Horton>You get the job you want it. Got it. Boom.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32117-0
<v Ricky Horton>Vista doesn't say everything's perfect
because we know what Vista wants.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32117-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is that an evidence or does Vista cause
an extra step for you guys?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32117-2
<v Ricky Horton>So the extra step is this isn't our end
all, be all for the estimate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32117-3
<v Ricky Horton>This gets exported and either.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32128-0
<v Ricky Horton>To proboard heavy bid and then that is
exported and then sent to Vista and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32128-1
<v Ricky Horton>it comes back to that correct.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32156-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the never ending thing program's not</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32156-1
<v Ricky Horton>talking to each other. Yeah,
that's what you have to hear. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32156-2
<v Ricky Horton>Do they use all exporting or is there a
lot of manual? I'd say it's all export,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32156-3
<v Ricky Horton>but again, that's done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32159-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32173-0
<v Ricky Horton>You I don't know how long we would change
that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32173-1
<v Ricky Horton>Are you exporting the POS from here to
build Vista?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32227-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because we generate the PO,
the PO numbers specifically in Vista.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32227-1
<v Ricky Horton>So in order to create the PO in tech,
I've got to generate a Vista purchaser,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32227-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know what I mean?
So why does it have to be that way?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32227-3
<v Ricky Horton>Did we talk about this accounting?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32257-0
<v Ricky Horton>The county went through. Yeah, they they.
I mean, they dictate it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32257-1
<v Ricky Horton>They they're on set. So I've used,
I've used tech ones specifically for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32257-2
<v Ricky Horton>fields and they have to put it
specifically to everybody else.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32271-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hand the the report from and I would say
accounting for the but I think the reason</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32271-1
<v Ricky Horton>we do it from.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32305-0
<v Ricky Horton>Vista to technically I'm not the expert,
so it's not our PO.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32305-1
<v Ricky Horton>So is so we follow a number lately. Yeah.
Do you have,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32305-2
<v Ricky Horton>do you have to manually type out the PO
in Vista?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32332-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you're doing it twice.
You're doing it in this and then after</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32332-1
<v Ricky Horton>that and you're doing it again.
That sucks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32332-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I I and I I'm emulating type out half
of the PM, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32332-3
<v Ricky Horton>because it it auto generates.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32363-0
<v Ricky Horton>The number portion, yeah,
because this is what they wanted and we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32363-1
<v Ricky Horton>changed our PO configurations to match
their their number system now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32363-2
<v Ricky Horton>But what they realized in in our old
system used to work so much better was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32402-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our job number came before the PO number
and the PO number used to only be three</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32402-1
<v Ricky Horton>to four number with you know digits.
Well then they realized now if they only</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32402-2
<v Ricky Horton>have a six digit code,
so we're in the 400,000 tradings.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32453-0
<v Ricky Horton>400,000, well,
they don't know what ******* job it goes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32453-1
<v Ricky Horton>to until they go back to try to look into
and then they have to hope that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32453-2
<v Ricky Horton>So now what we have to do is is again,
so I create the PO,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32453-3
<v Ricky Horton>I add the job and then I take that job
number like the AZR file number we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32453-4
<v Ricky Horton>looking at.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32485-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I add that to the PO and then take
that full PO including the job number and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32485-1
<v Ricky Horton>then add it to Tecla.
So the PO that the PO in Tecla PO number</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32485-2
<v Ricky Horton>does match the PO,
the PO number in this because my because</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32485-3
<v Ricky Horton>my.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32516-0
<v Ricky Horton>So have you have you tried the export?
So have you tried? OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32516-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's creating your I created in Tekla
then tried to export it. Will it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32516-2
<v Ricky Horton>Have you tried to see the line items good?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32551-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm wondering if you can see your the PDF,
the best one and dump it in tech. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32551-1
<v Ricky Horton>I I save the.
I save the tech surely because it's so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32551-2
<v Ricky Horton>much cleaner.
Either that or I'll take the quote or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32551-3
<v Ricky Horton>dump it into Vista.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32599-0
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of people just take it.
It's it's I'm going back and forth</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32599-1
<v Ricky Horton>between the I'm.
I'm curious if it will actually be</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32599-2
<v Ricky Horton>employed in that area. I so with Vista,
I just do it as a I don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32599-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't include everyone.
You don't you don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32644-0
<v Ricky Horton>What you received? No, it's the lump sum.
Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32644-1
<v Ricky Horton>OK cuz I mean this much money that you're
actually typing in the tech in tech.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32644-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was making an assumption. Yeah, yeah,
sorry, no. So I'm not doing. OK, OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32644-3
<v Ricky Horton>but if you wanted to go over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32657-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm wondering if if we could still do it.
If you wanted to do that, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32657-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think it'd be great for that, yeah,
but I I mean.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32690-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can you define PO for me?
Is the PO coming?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32690-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is the PO coming from the customer? No,
we we issue the PO to the vendors.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32690-2
<v Ricky Horton>The vendor purchases the vendor and
supplier.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32690-3
<v Ricky Horton>You guys are talking here about
purchasing material material from.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32698-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whoever. But yes, what you're talking,
I might be wrong here is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32712-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is all this is internal.
You're not buying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32712-1
<v Ricky Horton>Are you buying on a second or you're
buying on the Vista?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32753-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, he gets the,
he gets the number for Vista, the job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32753-1
<v Ricky Horton>he gets the number, the PO number,
the job number.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32753-2
<v Ricky Horton>Then he takes all that and he enters it
into Tecla and he actually writes out the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32753-3
<v Ricky Horton>person in a text if I understand
correctly. Where's the customer PM?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32783-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's your contract. I mean, Bob,
you have to work the customer orders.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32783-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now when you say the customer,
like the people we're doing the work for,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32783-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, that'll be, OK,
so the work comes in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32833-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a spot for it exactly.
Once you get a job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32833-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can turn your estimate into a project,
if I'm not mistaken, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32833-2
<v Ricky Horton>You get the job. So we got this job.
So now we got to pull the building from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32833-3
<v Ricky Horton>an estimate to a project, right?
It doesn't pull the data,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32833-4
<v Ricky Horton>but you got to set up the project. Yes,
I set up the project in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32846-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's why you guys can't start it in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32846-1
<v Ricky Horton>Tekla because that's that has to be done
before anything gets done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32856-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
You got to have a quarter in Vista before</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32856-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can give it in.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32860-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's like I think what you're saying is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32902-0
<v Ricky Horton>Creating the PM,
but not finalizing it so that there's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32902-1
<v Ricky Horton>essentially just no information other
than the PM number and then the backer</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32902-2
<v Ricky Horton>and then seeing all the line by the line.
Yeah, I don't know if it would do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32937-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't even know if you need to do it
cause actually you probably put one other</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32937-1
<v Ricky Horton>item in with the total maybe even quicker
than trying to export.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32937-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah I mean I wasn't going to say how
much time is to add to my work flow,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32937-3
<v Ricky Horton>but I mean if this is what it needs to be
done to like if it's simplifies somebody</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32937-4
<v Ricky Horton>else's job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32951-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wait, what is?
This is how I'm procuring this. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32951-1
<v Ricky Horton>let me hear me as well as the PC for the
shop, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32983-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we don't have a dedicated programmer
procurement. Yeah, all of that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32983-1
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody here, you buy all the material,
all raw material, all raw material. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/32983-2
<v Ricky Horton>so let's say the PO.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33029-0
<v Ricky Horton>They get the invoice in.
I'm not sure of the total process,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33029-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they get the invoice invoice in.
Let's say it doesn't match what you have</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33029-2
<v Ricky Horton>on the PA. What do they do with that?
Do they come back to you? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33029-3
<v Ricky Horton>they get the but typically he adds a
snippet of the detailed one in Tecla</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33029-4
<v Ricky Horton>because that's also how we set up our
overdue schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33053-0
<v Ricky Horton>By that item,
you have to attach it to the one. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33053-1
<v Ricky Horton>to the one.
I guess you have to do the one item and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33053-2
<v Ricky Horton>attach that into the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33093-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just so you guys know, Tammy,
as soon as you have access to Vista,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33093-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can talk to him.
It's kind of weird here,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33093-2
<v Ricky Horton>but and everybody can talk to you.
So like, if I'm putting this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33093-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's a fund by a new drill board or they
wouldn't buy into a drill middle,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33093-4
<v Ricky Horton>they're not going to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33131-0
<v Ricky Horton>The way when I got here is like great for
all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33131-1
<v Ricky Horton>So when I'm doing one thing I do if I
have a guy in the warehouse,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33131-2
<v Ricky Horton>he is doing all the funneling,
all procurement for receivable and OK and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33131-3
<v Ricky Horton>trying to minimize everyone else not not
so much.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33170-0
<v Ricky Horton>From the perspective of control of cost,
but more of taking those responsibilities</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33170-1
<v Ricky Horton>away from people so they can focus on
other stuff. Yeah. So ideally, and yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33170-2
<v Ricky Horton>so this is where we're talking,
we're not always as much at all,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33170-3
<v Ricky Horton>but we're getting,
I believe we'll say no more than</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33170-4
<v Ricky Horton>consumable price, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33191-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33192-0
<v Ricky Horton>Correct. Right. I do for my work.
If that is the case, he doesn't mind.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33192-1
<v Ricky Horton>I would have it. I would have it.
I would have the issue.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33192-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say everybody's job waiting. Yeah,
automatic reports can be dependent.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33194-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, Cortana.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33218-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just our It varies.
It depends on the moving some jobs.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33218-1
<v Ricky Horton>Good job. Yeah, I understand.
The next thing is to have. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33218-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's right.
Taking the information from that one,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33218-3
<v Ricky Horton>supporter, letting you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33246-0
<v Ricky Horton>True bits. Everything is at least three.
And then I get the and then I'll reach</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33246-1
<v Ricky Horton>out and have a guidance.
Sometimes it's only one field.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33246-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's like it's three. Who? Who asked you?
It's I don't know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33272-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're nesting too. Yes.
This is programming all of the the play.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33272-1
<v Ricky Horton>Wow. I've never heard of the procurement.
I'd be a nesting guy. Well, I I hear you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33272-2
<v Ricky Horton>I hear you. There's one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33310-0
<v Ricky Horton>Instances of it happened because I've
been researching here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33310-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've been researching your your role and
all the stuff in there. For example,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33310-2
<v Ricky Horton>project coordinator,
project coordinator typically doesn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33310-3
<v Ricky Horton>have.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33345-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, never.
But there's jobs out there that you can</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33345-1
<v Ricky Horton>look up when you tell them it's your
little shop that they're only operating</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33345-2
<v Ricky Horton>three guys. Yeah,
that's what it's like other place that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33345-3
<v Ricky Horton>they.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33385-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, you got a project manager,
a project engineer, a project coordinator.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33385-1
<v Ricky Horton>They turn around and they say, oh,
you know what? I need this part.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33385-2
<v Ricky Horton>They gather,
they hand it over to the purchasing agent</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33385-3
<v Ricky Horton>and that guy just purchasing it and then
track and let him know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33414-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the minority of the shops I go to.
I mean, vast minority.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33414-1
<v Ricky Horton>I I would say 95 to 98% of shops I go to,
the purchasing agent is doing the nesting</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33414-2
<v Ricky Horton>as well. Yeah, totally.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33440-0
<v Ricky Horton>By far, because instructional,
it's supervised. Yeah, the system does it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33440-1
<v Ricky Horton>The system does it for you. Yeah,
I get it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33440-2
<v Ricky Horton>Wait until you start getting the complex
stuff. Yeah, so, but going back to this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33476-0
<v Ricky Horton>It compliance. Yeah, yeah,
but I'm talking nesting it to this,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33476-1
<v Ricky Horton>to our actual systems,
to our actual machines.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33476-2
<v Ricky Horton>How many times last year we could program
on Java in there?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33476-3
<v Ricky Horton>Did all of them required?
All of them required?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33476-4
<v Ricky Horton>You're you're talking about.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33516-0
<v Ricky Horton>Doing the combining and then also doing
it basically for the machines as well</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33516-1
<v Ricky Horton>because of no integration. Pronis,
you're in Pronis there, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33516-2
<v Ricky Horton>And that was on the thing, right?
And that was really the thing I was</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33516-3
<v Ricky Horton>working on Friday,
but we'd still have to see the dronis</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33516-4
<v Ricky Horton>first.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33547-0
<v Ricky Horton>But then for it to pull into, yeah,
checkpoint. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33547-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's how we provide how much sheet we
need. Yeah, sure. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33547-2
<v Ricky Horton>So like what I do now because vendors,
not to say that they're, they take,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33547-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
time to gather all their information</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33547-4
<v Ricky Horton>before they give it back to them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33595-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll find it out.
So at least they're working on something</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33595-1
<v Ricky Horton>for me 'cause it's a lot easier to say,
hey, I thought I needed two sheets,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33595-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I actually need 4 sheets. So yeah,
so I send it out to them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33595-3
<v Ricky Horton>I go back into our system, figure out, oh,
I actually do need these many sheets or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33595-4
<v Ricky Horton>actually instead of sheets is I'm gonna
go with A5X instead of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33626-0
<v Ricky Horton>4 by 8 because of the primers of our our
machines.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33626-1
<v Ricky Horton>We give them kind of an advanced building
type of thing so they don't get some of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33626-2
<v Ricky Horton>this stuff and we start working.
But you yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33626-3
<v Ricky Horton>you could even nest nest the plate in the
system for ordering purposes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33641-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then for,
but you're going to do it in progress to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33641-1
<v Ricky Horton>see what you really need.
This is real numbers. You offer this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33641-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you guys are getting ripped off.
There's some big numbers for standards.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33643-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33650-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean the 260 looks OK,
the 810 for a channel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33654-0
<v Ricky Horton>688 for a piece of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33662-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those are some big numbers and that was
our speaking approach.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33663-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33703-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you're buying a four by eights.
Nobody loves that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33703-1
<v Ricky Horton>You're buying from post.
It's not the low bid stainless guy.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33703-2
<v Ricky Horton>They were lower the price. Really.
So if you guys have connection,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33703-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to take, you know,
whoever you're using on your price.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33756-0
<v Ricky Horton>Particularly going back to this.
So if you want to give me,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33756-1
<v Ricky Horton>we can look at trying to get that in
there because it is supposed to import.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33756-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now the general flow is they're saying
imported to Vista, imported to Vista.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33756-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So if it's a benefit to you, cool,
it's gonna take more time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33772-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that I if it's working now,
don't break it, right? You know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33772-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I don't know that I I I would,
but we will see if you wanted to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33824-0
<v Ricky Horton>Either way I I still still I still have
to create the price.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33824-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's not going to limit you need you need
Vista creating the number then yet.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33824-2
<v Ricky Horton>But what I'm saying is can you just
create the PO without anything and then</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33824-3
<v Ricky Horton>we we push the line items over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33859-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
created in Vista just with no lot items,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33859-1
<v Ricky Horton>no nothing on the PO.
You've created the PO, just don't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33859-2
<v Ricky Horton>You're not putting any. Yep.
And then and then you created it in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33859-3
<v Ricky Horton>Tackler, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33895-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you push from Tecla over to
Vista and all the line items go over with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33895-1
<v Ricky Horton>the. Yeah, you can make a.
The typical flow would be you create it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33895-2
<v Ricky Horton>in in Tecla and you push it over.
It creates it in this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33935-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so,
but but you got to have the numbers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33935-1
<v Ricky Horton>I do know that Vista,
if if anything changes on the PO,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33935-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's a problem, right?
Like you ordered a 40, they ship,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33935-3
<v Ricky Horton>they ship you a 45 footer, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33966-0
<v Ricky Horton>That that's a that's a problem.
You got to go manually change that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33966-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm going back and manually changing
the lump sum number. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33966-2
<v Ricky Horton>if they do that to me. Yeah.
So so if you want to look at it,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33966-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't let's see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33982-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not.
I'm not as much of an expert there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33982-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we can we get the right people
involved if that's a benefit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33982-2
<v Ricky Horton>If it's not a benefit, don't do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/33992-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's at least worse if it can do
that. If it does, I agree. Alright, I see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34010-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if if if that is the case,
phase codes are critical cost codes in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34010-1
<v Ricky Horton>here,
they are critical that you end up on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34010-2
<v Ricky Horton>everything.
So I think we're just looking at is it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34010-3
<v Ricky Horton>easier for you to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34025-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
take a PDF at a tech down to to Vista or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34025-1
<v Ricky Horton>as he's here to transfer, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34026-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34049-0
<v Ricky Horton>If it's if, if it's working the way it is,
I don't know that it's any better,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34049-1
<v Ricky Horton>but if it gives them more information and
less questions back to you, maybe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34051-0
<v Ricky Horton>Person.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Gosh, that'd be really possible. Maybe.
Maybe we don't do it. Yeah, don't do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34069-1
<v Ricky Horton>Everything's all good.
Let's don't create a problem.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34093-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just know it's there if if down the road
you there's a needle. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34093-1
<v Ricky Horton>you probably need to check your projects.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34095-0
<v Ricky Horton>And there is like 3, two, one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34117-0
<v Ricky Horton>206 a pound and three or four,
one and three were just a couple.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34117-1
<v Ricky Horton>That is really high numbers,
like $8 and $6 a month.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34117-2
<v Ricky Horton>Were they an oddball size? Did you notice?
That's nameless,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34117-3
<v Ricky Horton>isn't that much like we've worked with a
lot, so yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34155-0
<v Ricky Horton>It didn't seem that on all I mean,
but they probably aren't just stocking</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34155-1
<v Ricky Horton>distributors,
so they're probably getting it from</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34155-2
<v Ricky Horton>somebody else and you're paying to get it
there. He definitely, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34155-3
<v Ricky Horton>he's got another plan that he offers,
but it it was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34155-4
<v Ricky Horton>So I just really look at the totals that
you're buying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34188-0
<v Ricky Horton>They bought it from his guy at Ryerson
and resold it to him.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34188-1
<v Ricky Horton>And I I think that's, you know,
I think Ryerson knows I don't all operate</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34188-2
<v Ricky Horton>that way.
Maybe the more volume you do with them,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34188-3
<v Ricky Horton>the better they're priced against them
essentially. And they all sort of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34223-0
<v Ricky Horton>If he was, you know, if you,
since I don't think that you're doing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34223-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm really, I see you all,
I see you all around in any look,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34223-2
<v Ricky Horton>all of it has to be shot. Yes, yeah,
but if it's not, if it's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34255-0
<v Ricky Horton>There are some instances where the guy's
gonna be able to ask me to work here</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34255-1
<v Ricky Horton>something. Yeah,
if it's going to the field directly,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34255-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's that's outside. Who does that?
They were PM.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34255-3
<v Ricky Horton>How do you like to do the PM? The PE?
The PE? The PM will task the PE.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34255-4
<v Ricky Horton>Like I said, sometimes they.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34278-0
<v Ricky Horton>Reach out and then ask me to either
provide a vendor or.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34278-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just surprised it's not like one that
everybody feeds them on data. Yeah, right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34278-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's surprised what happened.
Every other product company I did that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34311-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the plan was, yeah,
recon here at rotor system that's coming</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34311-1
<v Ricky Horton>about and that would be there would be a
preparing the person in there to prepare</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34311-2
<v Ricky Horton>for this facility and all the other
facilities. So I guess what's the?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
because that's how you make it easier for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-1
<v Ricky Horton>one person to do it all.
You're actually going to save money</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-2
<v Ricky Horton>because instead of having 10 different
people going to all these places to buy a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-3
<v Ricky Horton>little bit here and over there,
one person is buying everything he may</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-4
<v Ricky Horton>say, even though he's probably in here,
may have said, oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34361-5
<v Ricky Horton>I think he can buy a beer for his rights.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, this guy is purchasing every day,
all night for a living.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34385-1
<v Ricky Horton>He knows he can get a better price on
that big item.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34385-2
<v Ricky Horton>He can work all of it for 500 jobs at the
same time. Not really one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34385-3
<v Ricky Horton>Our can you get a better price our.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34412-0
<v Ricky Horton>Processes require me to reach out to our
PDS and PMS if there is an overrun on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34412-1
<v Ricky Horton>material, but yeah,
but that's purely the customer I see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34412-2
<v Ricky Horton>I see under the budget.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34435-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.
There's the few instances where it's very</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34435-1
<v Ricky Horton>tight and I there's only so many vendors
and so many strings I can ask to hold.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34435-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's good.
Who's your biggest vendor?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Currently, probably.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34469-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, it used to be born in anything,
kind of like what year and a half ago,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34469-1
<v Ricky Horton>but not rice.
The problem with brown is to be able to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34469-2
<v Ricky Horton>play. So sure, they're great on, you know,
beams and HSS.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34526-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if that vendor been acquired by Delta
Steel,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34526-1
<v Ricky Horton>they are pricing it's that they're eating
brown for recasts.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34526-2
<v Ricky Horton>Even on the even on the we've got a
really good relationship with them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34526-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean and I tell all of my my vendors
like listen if you want our business like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34526-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's price.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34568-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all the time.
That'd be great if it. But it's, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34568-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've got no problem like making them
compete though.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34568-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'll tell them like I'm getting it for
this price.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34568-3
<v Ricky Horton>I won't tell them we want them to get it.
Yeah, yeah. And if you can either, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34568-4
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, 100%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34607-0
<v Ricky Horton>I say that I said, you know, you're close.
I don't know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34607-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll never tell anybody anybody's price.
It's a it's a line. That's the words.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34607-2
<v Ricky Horton>Those are the words. That's what I use.
That's the ones I use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34607-3
<v Ricky Horton>I like playing games with me,
so I play games with them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34607-4
<v Ricky Horton>This is the price and that's what.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34611-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have to have you take,
there would be this out and any problems</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34611-1
<v Ricky Horton>with you during this time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34639-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just surprised you are. Yeah.
You're all and all the other stuff you do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34639-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, yeah, all of them.
All those things carrying everything on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34639-2
<v Ricky Horton>the shoulder. Well,
then it's saying we got all these BB's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34639-3
<v Ricky Horton>We just right. We just the coding project,
yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34656-0
<v Ricky Horton>But as you get to the PM's and the TD's
are all right in the first order too. Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34656-1
<v Ricky Horton>hereby all the pain too. Not right now,
but will eventually. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34656-2
<v Ricky Horton>they want me to do that also.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34664-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's really simple, though we need.
So it's like, that's not something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34667-0
<v Ricky Horton>That sounds like still.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34711-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's produce for us really easy.
It's very delicious. It's simple.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34711-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know, we're seeing,
we're seeing the difference with our</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34711-2
<v Ricky Horton>consumables and our tools by finally
living with one guy,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34711-3
<v Ricky Horton>trying to stop everybody else from
purchasing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34711-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's a nightmare because everybody has
access and control right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34747-0
<v Ricky Horton>Through this building program, yes,
we'll get to that. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34747-1
<v Ricky Horton>they can't have that back say, hey,
who wants out of the business?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34747-2
<v Ricky Horton>You gotta go to Skype.
But you can't have vendors, right? I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34747-3
<v Ricky Horton>though,
some there's gotta be a control where.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34773-0
<v Ricky Horton>The vendors are rather at a higher level.
They are, but it's. I can ask.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34773-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can just send it to every nine vendor
and send it over to OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34773-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're in and they'll have it. Yeah,
no questions asked. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34810-0
<v Ricky Horton>It depends on the what it is,
but there's some requirements,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34810-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's just 79 two.
I'm assuming they negotiate payment terms</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34810-2
<v Ricky Horton>with each vendor,
they this many days or whatever, no.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34830-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you know.
They'd like to pay you and you might see</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34830-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you're not, you know, pay for six.
You should be able to get suppliers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34830-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you don't want to get paid in 30,
you don't pay you in 19.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34830-3
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to get paid in 19, we pay you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34875-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're in the transition period where
things are changing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34875-1
<v Ricky Horton>So because there's some intricacy.
So we just now know we can go in and make</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34875-2
<v Ricky Horton>notes.
I think they desire to be director</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34875-3
<v Ricky Horton>procurement to saw that last week.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34882-0
<v Ricky Horton>What is the director? We have to.
Good question. Thank you, thank you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34886-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did he agree with the purchasing?
I don't think so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34900-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right now warehouse is kind of he's been
talking directly with the management is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34900-1
<v Ricky Horton>long. They've been guiding him.
They got him through this acne tool,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34900-2
<v Ricky Horton>the tool crit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34949-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they're he's staying in line with
that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34949-1
<v Ricky Horton>Ideally we would have to be one person
here to do that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34949-2
<v Ricky Horton>My biggest thing is we're not coding
everything correctly, so we have to again,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34949-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's extra work for people at Mark and
I'd like to resuse purchases.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34966-0
<v Ricky Horton>Was.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34976-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you're sure that you've been totally
correctly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/34976-1
<v Ricky Horton>It was aimed at and we had to use that
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35018-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everything seems to stretch to fault
sometimes when purchasing games for a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35018-1
<v Ricky Horton>year to date.
It's like now I'm like the day supports.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35018-2
<v Ricky Horton>This is the question.
Was it better or worse last year before</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35018-3
<v Ricky Horton>the acquisition?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35053-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's that? Well,
it depends on your definition in that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35053-1
<v Ricky Horton>case. I mean,
I know it was better because everything</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35053-2
<v Ricky Horton>was kind of local,
step up and local and now things will</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35053-3
<v Ricky Horton>become more, more,
more time constraints on these things,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35053-4
<v Ricky Horton>you know, and they're.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35075-0
<v Ricky Horton>We work for accountants,
that's their their accountants at the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35075-1
<v Ricky Horton>core.
So everything in financial language more</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35075-2
<v Ricky Horton>or less.
So that's the biggest problem here and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35075-3
<v Ricky Horton>there's no change like.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35125-0
<v Ricky Horton>The spoggles, we tell them, you know, hey,
these are awesome,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35125-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we're going to just throw them and
it's hot as **** in the summer and these</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35125-2
<v Ricky Horton>fog up and they said bad, but that's,
you know, you're getting fired.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35125-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it's like they they don't really
respond well to certain things.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35125-4
<v Ricky Horton>So we've had to try to navigate and do
things.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35128-0
<v Ricky Horton>Figure out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35141-0
<v Ricky Horton>But no,
we don't want to keep purchase these.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35164-0
<v Ricky Horton>But no,
we know there's there's some people that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35164-1
<v Ricky Horton>are over.
But do we have other things or it's just</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35164-2
<v Ricky Horton>open floor? I you know,
if we're done with the J job,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35164-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's a full job.
I'd love to full job if we're done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35165-0
<v Ricky Horton>For a job from this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35167-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go ahead.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35173-0
<v Ricky Horton>Who? Who here is under Wells is the best?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35179-0
<v Ricky Horton>That when Arizona wouldn't this adjust?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35181-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35207-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to tell you,
all things Bell does a really good,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35207-1
<v Ricky Horton>good job. All things Bell. They're small,
but they they run real, real.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35207-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're pretty custom about something.
They they do a lot of structures.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35234-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're short on this slide.
I was cutting edge. Do you know them?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35234-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. I don't know.
I'll do 90 minutes. Sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35234-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was just looking at jobs like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35259-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, so let's, I guess The thing is,
let's look and see what the labor is for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35259-1
<v Ricky Horton>this comparing what it what you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35272-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did and then see what we if we determine
what we would want to adjust.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35330-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I guess one of the questions I would
have is does the estimate really match</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35330-1
<v Ricky Horton>the actual, in other words,
where the big changes between the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35330-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate and the actual to where we
really compared apples and oranges.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35330-3
<v Ricky Horton>You know if if if what the estimate is
similar to what you actually did,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35330-4
<v Ricky Horton>we can adjust off of it, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35340-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're doing in the post war.
Yeah, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35340-1
<v Ricky Horton>I need to stand up because I can't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35381-0
<v Ricky Horton>For shop now,
are they actually entering in weld time</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35381-1
<v Ricky Horton>versus cut times versus, you know,
general fabrication and layout?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35381-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are they not separating that and shopping
them? No, we've separated all of that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35381-3
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what's getting reported.
That's correct. So what happening? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35381-4
<v Ricky Horton>that's solver.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-0
<v Ricky Horton>That way if it's a normal run on one
specific thing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's how we got accounted. Yeah,
that makes perfect sense. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-2
<v Ricky Horton>because if we look at it,
you can see a lump sum.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-3
<v Ricky Horton>We should change the S.
Is that how you look at every job?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-4
<v Ricky Horton>Handling cuts off? We should change the S.
So it just gives you those tones instead</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35434-5
<v Ricky Horton>of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35441-0
<v Ricky Horton>All the breakdown of get piece move,
all that jazz. Yeah, that'd be nice. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35441-1
<v Ricky Horton>I see this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35469-0
<v Ricky Horton>The the hours fields aren't showing on
here. You want to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35469-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is that what you're looking for?
Just I'll bring up the column.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35469-2
<v Ricky Horton>You go down at the bottom Gantt chart
display settings.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35490-0
<v Ricky Horton>And hit the little arrow and then Scroll
down in that list and then you can check</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35490-1
<v Ricky Horton>the the hours and stuff there so it'll
show up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35504-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know where the years are linked
regular or overtime or whatever, but yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35504-1
<v Ricky Horton>total I appreciate it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35527-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is he knowing you need is 12 hours for
each one of those categories that we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35527-1
<v Ricky Horton>talked about? OK,
so he's got a far right with the size of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35527-2
<v Ricky Horton>12 hours. Yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35528-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35538-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, do do what? Check one other thing.
Scroll down in here. Go. Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you put it in original estimated,
I'm assuming,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35553-1
<v Ricky Horton>or you just put the hours in adjustment?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35555-0
<v Ricky Horton>I believe.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35560-0
<v Ricky Horton>The adjustment. OK, so that's the. OK,
cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35593-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you're saying 30 was basically your
estimated hours and 29 is your actual.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35593-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's pretty good. OK,
so I got a question on that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35593-2
<v Ricky Horton>Show me that item.
Give me a give me a line item.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35618-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or is that particular? Is that one piece?
No, that's the entire piece. I know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35618-1
<v Ricky Horton>I guess you're super close on the whole
thing. Drill down for me a little bit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35618-2
<v Ricky Horton>Show me a piece.
Scroll to the right to cause.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35623-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are we seeing the whole picture here?
Yeah, that's it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35665-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's just sequence one.
How come it has the base hours is 0 on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35665-1
<v Ricky Horton>the left and then you end up having total
hours on the right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35665-2
<v Ricky Horton>Base hours are supposed to be pulled from
check. OK, yeah, it it pull.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35711-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the way this can work is you can leave
the production control job to the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35711-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimate and it will say OK,
based off the estimate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35711-2
<v Ricky Horton>here's hours per ton and that can be
broken down in many ways.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35711-3
<v Ricky Horton>It will apply it to the material that's
in production control and it will flow in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35711-4
<v Ricky Horton>as base hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35752-0
<v Ricky Horton>That can then be compared to estimated
hours. So it might be OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35752-1
<v Ricky Horton>I have 150 hours of of estimated,
but my base hour says you really got 200</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35752-2
<v Ricky Horton>hours of work.
That's what I'm using to plan for the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35752-3
<v Ricky Horton>schedule.
So it's kind of like base hours is kind</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35752-4
<v Ricky Horton>of like a re-estimate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35791-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually use.
You're telling me this is accurate?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35791-1
<v Ricky Horton>You guys are that close on it.
That's pretty damn good. Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35791-2
<v Ricky Horton>I like this is only have 30 hours, right?
120 hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35791-3
<v Ricky Horton>What we're looking at right here at the
top, it's going to take all of those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35825-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you have well fed up. OK, I see.
What I'm missing is shows are spot on.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35825-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm looking in QC time. Yes.
So QC time,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35825-2
<v Ricky Horton>which is highlighted at the bottom there.
So it's my project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35849-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I get you there though,
because everybody, I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35849-1
<v Ricky Horton>you got a job for like 4 or 500 hours.
What I'm missing though is where is the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35849-2
<v Ricky Horton>total estimated in the total?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35862-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actual Can you bring up the Gantt chart
display settings again real quick? Yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35862-1
<v Ricky Horton>Sir.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35869-0
<v Ricky Horton>And Scroll down do total planned hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35891-0
<v Ricky Horton>And now scroll. Holy cow.
How's it that close? Yeah, that's hard.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35891-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's why they bring up a big job.
So you'll see like we went over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35935-0
<v Ricky Horton>But by now we're not. By now we're not.
We say 10 hours on and now we're saying.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35935-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can't believe that happened on the
majority of the jobs.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35935-2
<v Ricky Horton>We can bring up the moment here.
These when they're smaller,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35935-3
<v Ricky Horton>you can look at it down to take off of
the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35971-0
<v Ricky Horton>No one will do it.
I'd like to see something with several</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35971-1
<v Ricky Horton>$100 in it.
So did those estimated hours actually,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35971-2
<v Ricky Horton>are they residing in that estimate or is
that the here's what I think it's going</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35971-3
<v Ricky Horton>to?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/35972-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess move. Very good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36014-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those that's how long it would be
whatever was given to me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36014-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I would assume that that's.
So then let's give the estimate and let's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36014-2
<v Ricky Horton>look and see what the estimate came up
because if the estimate came up with 25</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36014-3
<v Ricky Horton>total hours,
we got a lot of adjustment to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36044-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yes, 7119.06. Now is that the same?
Are we comparing the same material to the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36044-1
<v Ricky Horton>same material? We got 8700 panels here.
What was it over there, do you know?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36049-0
<v Ricky Horton>8800 essentially a second so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36050-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36066-0
<v Ricky Horton>So 119 hours versus what was at the end
of. So let's do this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36066-1
<v Ricky Horton>Go back to the SM plan.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36083-0
<v Ricky Horton>And go to the uh, click anywhere.
There we go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36083-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now go to the drop down at the top
estimating drop down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36088-0
<v Ricky Horton>3rd from the bottom view labor details.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36109-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right click, dump that out in Excel.
We'll kind of sum this up to get it in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36109-1
<v Ricky Horton>the same chunks as what you got on your
schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36109-2
<v Ricky Horton>You want to export it to something you
said? Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36118-0
<v Ricky Horton>What percent of the job that you
estimated you went?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36147-0
<v Ricky Horton>Most I'd say 98 OK,
what percentage of the job that you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36147-1
<v Ricky Horton>overestimates? I'll win 5050, which, yeah,
any less. I hear the win rate is 4%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36193-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. So I got it. No, no, exactly.
Yeah, I got you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36193-1
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of what I do is the the bridge
planning runways,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36193-2
<v Ricky Horton>which are pretty regular, pretty regular.
So you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36193-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know you're going to get before they
even give me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36226-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they also build it more regularly so
they know how long it takes because it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36226-1
<v Ricky Horton>a repetitive product.
So you got a 98% get rate. I'm good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36226-2
<v Ricky Horton>We got to fix the 4%,
4% is not unusual for it's it's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36264-0
<v Ricky Horton>Very, very low.
I've seen 4 or 5% of a lot of,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36264-1
<v Ricky Horton>for example, ASD,
because they're so automated,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36264-2
<v Ricky Horton>they have like 20% because they have,
they can get any job where they want to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36264-3
<v Ricky Horton>They're more set up to do the work.
They can do it cheaper.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36292-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you get this? Yeah.
So let's what's what's the breakdowns on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36292-1
<v Ricky Horton>the estimate?
It's what's the what's that breakdown you</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36292-2
<v Ricky Horton>have? You got cut, fit, weld or handling.
Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36292-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I want to get that that total hours
called.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36299-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I want to get that in the same
categories as what's on the schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36320-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like take maybe down here,
down at like a 25 or something,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36320-1
<v Ricky Horton>put in like him on it and then we'll get
on this cut and then we'll tell the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36320-2
<v Ricky Horton>buddies down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36333-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is this a comment? This is me. Oh,
comment is a little bit different. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36333-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36338-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't bother me and it's a it's all
a problem.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36346-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so let's let's get those totals.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36365-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want the tolls from the any. Yeah,
from that column,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36365-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything that's going to be considered
handling, I guess so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36366-0
<v Ricky Horton>6.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36390-0
<v Ricky Horton>So my guess would be this one.
I'm assuming receiving material handling,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36390-1
<v Ricky Horton>move layout. That would fit up, right?
That'd probably fit up, I would imagine.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36390-2
<v Ricky Horton>No, I think that's about it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36408-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're handling. I mean,
if you have another problem,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36408-1
<v Ricky Horton>you put handling in,
you can just sum it by handling.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36408-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's interesting move isn't in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36426-0
<v Ricky Horton>Load would probably be part of it too,
right? So I would,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36426-1
<v Ricky Horton>I would assume receiving material
handling 16.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36449-0
<v Ricky Horton>2014 I say about 20 hours,
which category do you sum up? So layout,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36449-1
<v Ricky Horton>pinch, fit up, starting,
will clean material handling be part of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36449-2
<v Ricky Horton>handling? OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36451-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36458-0
<v Ricky Horton>You got, yeah, 14150 both.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36459-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying smoke this for you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36466-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not doing.
You got to put a cost in after each month,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36466-1
<v Ricky Horton>right? Yeah, or click one at a time.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36478-0
<v Ricky Horton>After equal sum,
put a left a left bracket and then click</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36478-1
<v Ricky Horton>on one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36489-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then left bracket. Yeah,
add all the numbers we arranged from.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36489-1
<v Ricky Horton>This this new people. Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36492-0
<v Ricky Horton>Get ready to be slow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36501-0
<v Ricky Horton>Get rid of the sun.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36509-0
<v Ricky Horton>14 load that would be part of the way.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36532-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say it right. Looks like it. Yeah.
The cut is probably anything we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36532-1
<v Ricky Horton>processing. Is that correct?
So probably cut all those and everything,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36532-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? So cut, you mean? Yep, Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36536-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, you probably won't search.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36537-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36548-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here. I think it's down there.
That's it then, right? Think so. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36568-0
<v Ricky Horton>We left it plus at the end, but OK, OK,
we're good. So yes,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36568-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's not really like 54 plus 570.
It's just because it's too big to take</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36568-2
<v Ricky Horton>the width.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36569-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not pretty.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36576-0
<v Ricky Horton>There you go.
Format cells to use in place, is it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36577-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36579-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like tell me about.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36605-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you are. We already got cut.
We already got cut in the cut.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36605-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you want to do just the burn,
just burn,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36605-2
<v Ricky Horton>just burn and burn because you put cut,
burn.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36607-0
<v Ricky Horton>In cut.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36611-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ask your point before.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36614-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's it, right? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36618-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it would be in layout right there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36620-0
<v Ricky Horton>Philip and Philip.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36632-0
<v Ricky Horton>Voice FP. Well, yes, it's very well.
That's a full pen, full pen. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36632-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's under well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36635-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36640-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then well, there's 9 and 10.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36684-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're talking about QC before,
that's what that checking is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36684-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it it is calculated in there,
but what's the total of that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36684-2
<v Ricky Horton>Does that equal our 119?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36689-0
<v Ricky Horton>We didn't put check in anywhere.
I don't think so. It's 90.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36705-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think we're missing check and we're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36705-1
<v Ricky Horton>missing that other down there or that
other might be.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36720-0
<v Ricky Horton>On this job, this is all 100. Yeah,
super close. Yeah, this is the breakdown.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36720-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is the breakdown of your estimate
level.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36725-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36746-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, it is. That's too good for me.
I think people here know what they're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36746-1
<v Ricky Horton>doing. The estimators don't. Well,
but I think there's also some control</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36746-2
<v Ricky Horton>issues.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36789-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's there's a lot of issues.
So the only thing we're missing is the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36789-1
<v Ricky Horton>other and the check.
That's those two add up with 113.19119.06.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36789-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're missing.
So with the check or layouts or we</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36789-3
<v Ricky Horton>haven't pick out spot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36830-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think check was one that added
separately down on the schedule somewhere</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36830-1
<v Ricky Horton>else. Is that correct? No,
it was it's tracked but not added. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36830-2
<v Ricky Horton>so it's it's direct under QC time. OK,
but it's not it'll give them a a number.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36865-0
<v Ricky Horton>They just,
they just apply as many hours as they</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36865-1
<v Ricky Horton>work on the job.
We'll leave it out to go back over the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36865-2
<v Ricky Horton>into the schedule.
Let's get the hours from the schedule</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36865-3
<v Ricky Horton>line up right next to these and see what
how they actually compare.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36892-0
<v Ricky Horton>QC is not estimated.
Is that what you're trying to get? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36892-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then when we're doing financial
reviews there,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36892-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know if you go over there,
but QC is an estimate,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36892-3
<v Ricky Horton>that's that's what that check is. So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36906-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's not. Well, it isn't in tackle,
but it isn't in any of the other.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36922-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's we're gonna be looking and even then,
even when it's shown in,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36922-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's not a number that we.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36953-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just zero.
They apply them if they need to check the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36953-1
<v Ricky Horton>material. I mean,
Mark can touch more on that than I can.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36953-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is that is the QC time added during the S?
Yeah, OK, by the month, but it is intact.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36985-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's what that's what I'm not
getting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36985-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean because we had so we were giving
up the basing hours out of the Tecla that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36985-2
<v Ricky Horton>take off right.
Well so we put it to one point none of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36985-3
<v Ricky Horton>those hours which it should have been I
believe it's like 5 some change.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/36991-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should have gone to QC.
They utilized almost 30, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37009-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's all that feedback looks like
working. It'll never get fixed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37009-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I'm still missing though, so to be it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37079-0
<v Ricky Horton>Check.
They have so many different steps that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37079-1
<v Ricky Horton>they're checking,
but there's 119 to take on.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37079-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's what you used on the schedule.
120 is what we utilized. So but then,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37079-3
<v Ricky Horton>but if you include QC, right,
so five of those should have been so</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37079-4
<v Ricky Horton>technically 5.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37091-0
<v Ricky Horton>Over. Mm-hmm. But if you include QC time,
we were over. I think it was 140. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37091-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37129-0
<v Ricky Horton>What we've asked at minimum if they're
not comfortable giving a number,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37129-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's just how does there are some buckets
so that they can kind of start getting an</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37129-2
<v Ricky Horton>average,
whether typically it's like 3 or 4% of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37129-3
<v Ricky Horton>the project budget is what a larger job,
right? It's what they should use.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37158-0
<v Ricky Horton>And the rest of that,
do you guys have to wait on QC? Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37158-1
<v Ricky Horton>And who pays for that time? We.
And so do you guys use a flagging system</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37158-2
<v Ricky Horton>to flag those up?
QC got 5 minutes and drop them. Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37191-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, we don't want to talk to you.
It could take me 5 minutes.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37191-1
<v Ricky Horton>It could take me 20 minutes. OK, well,
you know what happens. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37191-2
<v Ricky Horton>if you're standing waiting for a quality
check in shops that push this flag goes</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37191-3
<v Ricky Horton>up, the flag needs to be down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37228-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because of all understanding. Well,
we've done,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37228-1
<v Ricky Horton>we always just have another state that
they move to to. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37228-2
<v Ricky Horton>but that is definitely not always had the
luxury of saying go to this next skid.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37228-3
<v Ricky Horton>I get it. Same thing.
Sometimes you're waiting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37229-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37233-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is that the same breakdown as what we
had on the estimate? Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37270-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the the aspect of course that we know
gets a little more granular with like</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37270-1
<v Ricky Horton>load unload and we kind of just
consolidated.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37270-2
<v Ricky Horton>Well that's that's what we just did was
we consolidated.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37270-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I want to I want to yeah see how it
compares to it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37311-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's what I'm saying.
We can go ahead and set it up so that it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37311-1
<v Ricky Horton>automatically breaks it down like that if
you want to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37311-2
<v Ricky Horton>Right now we get the lump sum and then
we'll break it down on a sheet like is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37311-3
<v Ricky Horton>our initiation sheet. We said, hey,
you have 120 hours,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37311-4
<v Ricky Horton>here's how we want to see it broken down
and all that stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37347-0
<v Ricky Horton>So handling we showed roughly,
you guys have a matching schedule with</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37347-1
<v Ricky Horton>your total hours available and the hours
you're doing each day or you're not using.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37347-2
<v Ricky Horton>I have one that I specifically use. Yeah,
Excel, Excel Wise,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37347-3
<v Ricky Horton>but what we want to touch base on this
week is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37381-0
<v Ricky Horton>Incorporating our work packages that
we've been doing for several months now</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37381-1
<v Ricky Horton>and seeing that on a master.
So that breakdown is all backed out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37381-2
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't match. So what how did,
how did you get the breakdown of 3012840</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37381-3
<v Ricky Horton>and 30?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37425-0
<v Ricky Horton>The breakdown will come from the project
engineers. After they get the export,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37425-1
<v Ricky Horton>they'll consolidate it and then give us
those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37425-2
<v Ricky Horton>We consolidated it from the estimate,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37425-3
<v Ricky Horton>But Gap would have been the one in this
specific instance to consolidate it for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37425-4
<v Ricky Horton>that specific instance, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-0
<v Ricky Horton>Moved. But what I'm saying is,
if this is what you're looking at right</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-1
<v Ricky Horton>here, if that's what's on this,
how do we get these numbers?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-2
<v Ricky Horton>How do we get that right?
The project manager project in here said</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-3
<v Ricky Horton>I know here's what we think it's really
going to take.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-4
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to use this many hours here,
this many hours there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37482-5
<v Ricky Horton>It's different from you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37520-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. But some of this, yeah, yeah,
I understand.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37520-1
<v Ricky Horton>They just broke up how they saw fit.
If you look at fit and well, historically,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37520-2
<v Ricky Horton>we know that that was, well,
it wasn't taken for me now versus yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37520-3
<v Ricky Horton>what we're heading.
So that's why you would have taken.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37561-0
<v Ricky Horton>All of those 12 hours and allocated them
to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37561-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is anybody else saying to DS that they
got that that right? I am.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37561-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I want to see a job he did
because he knows what he's doing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37561-3
<v Ricky Horton>I want to see a job done by the
estimators.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37610-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sitting over there in Gilbert with 500
hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37610-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I want to see how that's not doing
this. It's being done by hand.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37610-2
<v Ricky Horton>But but what I'm saying is OK,
so we took the 100,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37610-3
<v Ricky Horton>we took the total hours and I'm just like
you may be telling me at the end of the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37610-4
<v Ricky Horton>job. They broke this down so tight.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37616-0
<v Ricky Horton>So rematch 100% of what happened in the
shop? No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37640-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't.
I'm I'm just wondering how that happened.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37640-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know that's that's really damn good
that they did that before you know flag</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37640-2
<v Ricky Horton>started getting raised so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37692-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's nice to see you.
You want to look at this one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37692-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have a 5 minute one?
I want to look at what you've done by</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37692-2
<v Ricky Horton>this.
I want that right in right view so that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37692-3
<v Ricky Horton>we so that we can see an average as well.
I get a different area,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37692-4
<v Ricky Horton>so it's never going to match until the
estimates are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37713-0
<v Ricky Horton>Estimate. OK,
then I guess what I'd like to see is one</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37713-1
<v Ricky Horton>of the project engineer and project
manager did versus actions.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37713-2
<v Ricky Horton>Can you look at that?
It would be good to see their estimated</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37713-3
<v Ricky Horton>tech lab versus their.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37740-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know their set up, it will match.
Well, that that's what's interesting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37740-1
<v Ricky Horton>So like you know our larger project,
we did 600 tons for LG.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our pre-car team treated me as a stub,
so I went in and reestimated it all</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-1
<v Ricky Horton>myself. Yeah,
so that they could sell to me if it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-2
<v Ricky Horton>aligned with their budget instead of
shocking it around me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-3
<v Ricky Horton>So even the ones that are in here that
are larger sounds,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-4
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still on my back and redoing the leg.
It was already done, you know what I mean?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37793-5
<v Ricky Horton>So it's kind of hard to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37820-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hold that loop.
I'd say they are all all been similar,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37820-1
<v Ricky Horton>but closer, closer minus.
I'll tell you what,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37820-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'll do this real quick because what what
I want to do.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37847-0
<v Ricky Horton>What I want to do is I want to set these
if we can get 241025 hundred jobs,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37847-1
<v Ricky Horton>the more the better lay them out side by
side like this so that I can see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37872-0
<v Ricky Horton>The trend so that if we see the
handling's always under by 20%,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37872-1
<v Ricky Horton>then you know that's what I'm wanting to
see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37872-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's been 2019 and I'm still worried
another.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37893-0
<v Ricky Horton>Alright, so we'll gather,
I'll put it down as an extra and we'll</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37893-1
<v Ricky Horton>see by let's say by the end of this week
to give us some time to consolidate that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37893-2
<v Ricky Horton>that fair.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37932-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm impressed that you guys are really
that for estimating to your job's done.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37932-1
<v Ricky Horton>You did everything,
but you just that's pretty good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37932-2
<v Ricky Horton>I've never been in a company that's done
that before. What do you judge on?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37932-3
<v Ricky Horton>Are you judged on what you do here or is
it judged on what pre prom?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37958-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's Wonderbuck looking at?
Wonderbuck is not looking at.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37958-1
<v Ricky Horton>The job is sold for $1,000,000.
They decided to use you because you were</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37958-2
<v Ricky Horton>cheaper.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37982-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you were even cheaper than their
estimates.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37982-1
<v Ricky Horton>So they you beat their estimate by 10%
and you beat your own estimate by 3%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/37982-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm kind of wondering where the judging
is being made.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38033-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I can see if you do your wonder
book, you're judging against yourself,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38033-1
<v Ricky Horton>but if you're part of a bigger piece,
then I assume that bigger piece has its</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38033-2
<v Ricky Horton>own wonder book. Well, on on that one,
I think we're still trying to establish</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38033-3
<v Ricky Horton>that good by using the algae. Again,
it was an 8 million project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38051-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I have 4 million of it.
So until I was done with my then the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38051-1
<v Ricky Horton>build portion started and I just kind of
have it off. We left, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38051-2
<v Ricky Horton>it all rolled up on her.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38080-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that'd be a great question. You know,
when you're speaking with Mr. Robino,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38080-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know a lot of it changes,
especially since we're kind of really</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38080-2
<v Ricky Horton>getting to the group with Bowen Broad, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38088-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'm just looking at a lot of data and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38088-1
<v Ricky Horton>just curious about how these numbers roll
out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38095-0
<v Ricky Horton>What was that other job name? What was it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38102-0
<v Ricky Horton>99 L OG20LX.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38119-0
<v Ricky Horton>The 25, OK. And that's the sitting. OK,
I'm just going to set all these side by</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38119-1
<v Ricky Horton>side as we do them and see what that
actually is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38120-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38126-0
<v Ricky Horton>So on this one then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38156-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if we could do the same thing here,
I would like to see what the estimate is,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38156-1
<v Ricky Horton>the estimated hours,
what your breakdown was and then what the</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38156-2
<v Ricky Horton>actual are same same type deal on this
one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38203-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want what we stand to 15 projects to
do?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38203-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do that 10 to 15 projects you'd like to
see or well, the the more the better.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38203-2
<v Ricky Horton>The bigger the sampling, the more.
Like I'll sometimes do this with 567</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38203-3
<v Ricky Horton>different ones and you'll find this one
job that is just totally whacked and it's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38203-4
<v Ricky Horton>the outlier. I'm not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38220-0
<v Ricky Horton>The rest of my labour based off a bit,
right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38220-1
<v Ricky Horton>But the rest a lot of times follow to a
general pattern where it's high over 20%</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38220-2
<v Ricky Horton>over 20% under.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38245-0
<v Ricky Horton>2% for the whole audit. Yeah,
that's crazy. That's amazing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38245-1
<v Ricky Horton>And that was like one of the estimate.
That's good, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38245-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's unbelievable. Really.
I'm actually unbelieving ****.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38298-0
<v Ricky Horton>And like a lot of what we've done,
we started implementing, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38298-1
<v Ricky Horton>this in 2020 and I can say, you know,
probably within the last 14 months</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38298-2
<v Ricky Horton>everything has been, you know,
a lot more teasing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38298-3
<v Ricky Horton>But if you go historically,
I definitely have some bumps and bruises</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38298-4
<v Ricky Horton>and scars.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38323-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, you see,
you worked with me on Shout Pavilion on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38323-1
<v Ricky Horton>that project. So you know what I mean?
I remember coming here twice as big for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38323-2
<v Ricky Horton>about 6 or 8 weeks meeting with you. Yeah.
So can we get the breakdown of handling</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38323-3
<v Ricky Horton>cutburn fit well?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38325-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, overall.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38326-0
<v Ricky Horton>We give you this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38347-0
<v Ricky Horton>Skewed because we had where we have eight
different lots and each lot have anywhere</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38347-1
<v Ricky Horton>between one to three, 8 sequences,
one to three lots per nine sequences.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38357-0
<v Ricky Horton>So he's one of the, yeah,
he's one of these, OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38363-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's cut saw, but I was just.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38370-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to think how we can get the
total.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38375-0
<v Ricky Horton>Get see where it says task up there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38383-0
<v Ricky Horton>And on the header going down, go down.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38397-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right there. All right.
Over to the over to the right of it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38397-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's a little arrow.
Hit that and on handling in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38407-0
<v Ricky Horton>It did not give us just a breakdown of
handling, did it?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38425-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but what if you do a full dump into Excel</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38425-1
<v Ricky Horton>of all this data and then run a pivot
table to consolidate the data?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38427-0
<v Ricky Horton>Have you put the tables?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38439-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have, yeah,
because it would be pretty quick. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38439-1
<v Ricky Horton>the problem would be getting this out to
Excel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38481-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's that's what I'm saying.
Get me into Excel.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38481-1
<v Ricky Horton>How am I getting it into Excel?
Cause it doesn't export.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38481-2
<v Ricky Horton>You go up to the project schedule drop
down, go to export.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38490-0
<v Ricky Horton>You got an export into Primavera or
Microsoft Project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38497-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is the camera on it with AI? Oh,
I see what it may be slow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38513-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do it in APDF and then have it look at
PDF to to do it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38513-1
<v Ricky Horton>You take a picture with the phone.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38514-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38516-0
<v Ricky Horton>Try reports.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38526-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually close this,
go hit the report down at the bottom</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38526-1
<v Ricky Horton>right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38528-0
<v Ricky Horton>There we go.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38535-0
<v Ricky Horton>Save that as a PDF.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38558-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've never seen any place before. Yeah,
that's why. Yeah, that's amazing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38558-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's probably some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38585-0
<v Ricky Horton>You've been around.
You don't see any bugs do that right now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38585-1
<v Ricky Horton>You're up by 230% either way. Yeah,
it's there's big swings. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38585-2
<v Ricky Horton>depending on the day.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38598-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what's in the shop, dude.
Can't you pull up? That's awesome, man.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38598-1
<v Ricky Horton>Exactly, I guess.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38623-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's awesome. It it's awesome.
So what does at the end of John still</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38623-1
<v Ricky Horton>hits my labor building?
It's like Alan's procurement time. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38623-2
<v Ricky Horton>the project set up.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38663-0
<v Ricky Horton>QC time,
all those numbers are not signed into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38663-1
<v Ricky Horton>here. So once you incorporate,
you know the six month project,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38663-2
<v Ricky Horton>but they're ahead of time,
then you're probably looking at that 20%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38663-3
<v Ricky Horton>Is they're ahead of time to get charged
to to the job? Is it job custom? Yes, Sir.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38663-4
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so it's not like overnight, right? No.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38695-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've been told to target to the project,
not to reduce.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38695-1
<v Ricky Horton>But how are you supposed to do this?
Those numbers though,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38695-2
<v Ricky Horton>are reflected right here though on the
schedule. No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38695-3
<v Ricky Horton>this is just my my guys in here because
those are, you know, that's not a count.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38695-4
<v Ricky Horton>There's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38706-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, with that, his time, his, you know,
your guys is not. It's it's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38742-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not estimated.
So when you pull this job up in Vista on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38742-1
<v Ricky Horton>the work report,
you're going to see those numbers skewed</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38742-2
<v Ricky Horton>because we have indirect costs that still
is associated with the job itself.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38742-3
<v Ricky Horton>So when you look at it, you probably,
Oh yeah, it's about 20%.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
this is just a a a labor basis for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38780-1
<v Ricky Horton>production.
The fact that their labor is that close</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38780-2
<v Ricky Horton>to any place they've been a lot of it on
here too that also does pretty well is</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38780-3
<v Ricky Horton>all our beans come in 90% on this project.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38801-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is just labor. You're thinking,
well, they come free process. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38801-1
<v Ricky Horton>so if I don't have to do all that,
then I'd probably be in a lot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38842-0
<v Ricky Horton>Closer to what you're when it when it
gets estimated,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38842-1
<v Ricky Horton>they do figure the the beam line work.
I'll call it right the the beams cut code</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38842-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know mark sometimes if they know I my
limitation with the W30 and thought as</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38842-3
<v Ricky Horton>work if you run into issues resolved.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38858-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, but if not,
I'll go take my dollar amount for labor</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38858-1
<v Ricky Horton>and transfer that over to a subcontractor
about you. Oh yes, Sir.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like this one, it was all lump sums.
But when I see the project,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-1
<v Ricky Horton>how can I make sure we're successful?
How can I make sure we get schedule and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-2
<v Ricky Horton>get the budget?
Then that becomes about me for needs and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-3
<v Ricky Horton>methods. Well,
I don't want to take these beans,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-4
<v Ricky Horton>so fall out, take my dollars.
They're charging me 95 bucks a bean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38915-5
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm doing it for 150 on the shot.
So you know what I mean? So.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38953-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's that in consideration when we
when we get these released as well.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38953-1
<v Ricky Horton>So when they estimate,
they don't know what's going to be about</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38953-2
<v Ricky Horton>or not. No,
they just estimate the time in there.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38953-3
<v Ricky Horton>Did you get cited or print or would you
be right? Just to see if I can export it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38953-4
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to say it as the by the way,
kudos y'all are doing this schedule.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38970-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's awesome. That's really,
really cool. It's really great.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38970-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is that was that sarcastic or towards me?
Because I'm the one that, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38970-2
<v Ricky Horton>has him do it.
Do you want to work with the other?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/38980-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, like this. They have to be a person.
You have to do this for. OK, got it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39027-0
<v Ricky Horton>We we've gotten this.
It was difficult at first,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39027-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I think now that we have a lot of
them already preset, yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39027-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's not so bad.
Now that we've worked in the work</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39027-3
<v Ricky Horton>packages,
that's one of those lovely ones where I</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39027-4
<v Ricky Horton>get to my reports and they start bringing
them up and.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are not including what I'm saying.
I'm going to realize time and then do my</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39069-1
<v Ricky Horton>work package.
You can break this down by work packages</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39069-2
<v Ricky Horton>too. Now by the way,
I don't know if that helps, but you could.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39069-3
<v Ricky Horton>It can be a breakdown item as opposed to
sequencer a lot or in addition to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39069-4
<v Ricky Horton>sequencer a lot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39074-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what percentage of the work that they
do in their UX and bio?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39109-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, we're getting to have it here.
I'd say about maybe 25%. When you do that,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39109-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can say whatever money,
whatever they pull out,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39109-2
<v Ricky Horton>they deduct that from the office in here.
Yes, Yep.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39115-0
<v Ricky Horton>So in fact, like never see those.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39159-0
<v Ricky Horton>That can see the the deductive amount.
They you know the time you put it into</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39159-1
<v Ricky Horton>the system,
we've already made that call on</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39159-2
<v Ricky Horton>adjustment. Yeah, got it.
Are you plugging something in the base</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39159-3
<v Ricky Horton>hours? Because like in the other job,
base hours was completed,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39159-4
<v Ricky Horton>but there were no hours in production
control.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39160-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39187-0
<v Ricky Horton>I wonder where the base hours came from
because on the other job there wasn't</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39187-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything in there were no hours in the
production.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39187-2
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes it pulls base hours and
sometimes it doesn't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39187-3
<v Ricky Horton>So where I kept the adjustment is.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39217-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can bring it, right? And sometimes,
like I said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39217-1
<v Ricky Horton>technical holds it over and it's not.
So I have to subtract those numbers.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39217-2
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes I just hold it over something
over and it's low. So then I pull it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39217-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, enough hours to to correlate.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39251-0
<v Ricky Horton>But your plan hours is what you're going
by, is that correct? No,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39251-1
<v Ricky Horton>they deduct the hours that they're going
to buy out first. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39251-2
<v Ricky Horton>what what I'm saying is the adjustment is
the adjustment plus the base hours equals</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39251-3
<v Ricky Horton>the plan hours, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39262-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know that's what it calculates,
but what are you going by?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39262-1
<v Ricky Horton>What is the correct estimate?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39306-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
total hours would be your your actual,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39306-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, the actual work.
I think we're going to see that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39306-2
<v Ricky Horton>consistently because I can say we never
linked the estimate to this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39306-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's always our input data that we
received.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39336-0
<v Ricky Horton>Ease that give us that breakdown that we
manual input.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39336-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I believe that's why it's always
adjusted hours instead of base out, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39336-2
<v Ricky Horton>Because we don't need the estimate to
this. So but this one had both.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39336-3
<v Ricky Horton>So like if you had 1000 in base.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39349-0
<v Ricky Horton>And -250 in adjustment and you're going
to have 750 plan dollars.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39364-0
<v Ricky Horton>Got into Excel.
I don't know if you want that Excel. Oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39364-1
<v Ricky Horton>you'd have made it. Yeah,
that would be beautiful.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39378-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just take a picture with AI.
Is that what you did? Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39378-1
<v Ricky Horton>I turned it into a test file.
Good for you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39391-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's your last name? Chris?
Can't tell you. OK, I might.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39391-1
<v Ricky Horton>How about that? ****.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39406-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, can you spell that? GAR.
I'm sure you do this every day. GARGI.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39421-0
<v Ricky Horton>Councillor Bravo, KRJWLOW.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39433-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to make some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39436-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he starts.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39447-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think I can call you by another low.
So yeah, I know. No, this is the team.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39447-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'm here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39462-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's too cheap. I'm too old.
You better have Gray hair. You're too old.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39462-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. That top was looking sus.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39480-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, I see the roots coming in.
You got to read it again.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39480-1
<v Ricky Horton>It sounds like my kids and grandkids.
Come on, check that room, bro. You know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39480-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to HR.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39483-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39488-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not easy to deal with this.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39489-0
<v Ricky Horton>You see, you know.
So now he's going to look for you,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39489-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's masterly.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39491-0
<v Ricky Horton>Office admin 712 to.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39496-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't, but I wasn't.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39507-0
<v Ricky Horton>This thing, yeah,
it's because it seems small.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39507-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's a large problem that's going to
factor. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39507-2
<v Ricky Horton>he's right about the direct to indirect.
It's like 11.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39509-0
<v Ricky Horton>You did it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39514-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I got some.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39519-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, we probably can just run a.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39523-0
<v Ricky Horton>We could probably be like a pivot table
or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39524-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mhm.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39525-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39526-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I have a video.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39531-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know how to hit the table here to get
that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39544-0
<v Ricky Horton>You have a good thing first. Can we do it?
Yes, Sir. OK.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39554-0
<v Ricky Horton>In all times, I think it was 1990 million.
You can do that **** anymore, man.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39572-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have a formula to get.
I can do formulas in this form.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39572-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can't remember that we got in the
system, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39572-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think we got some from the libraries.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39586-0
<v Ricky Horton>We've got the talent.
We've got the talent. I like to say it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39609-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's it. So you guys are talking.
Is this Office 365 or something? It's not.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39609-1
<v Ricky Horton>You're in 30 million. Yes, that's.
I got kids over using.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39619-0
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't know there's supposed to be
traveled. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39619-1
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't travel that on the beach a lot.
See, I can double your age.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39635-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I have no idea.
And it's weird as as I get older,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39635-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know, 25 years old at one point,
even when I can get 30, I'll see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39644-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all.
That's when you pick your blocks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39648-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39653-0
<v Ricky Horton>I follow them.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39659-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's going to find out if you're
fitting into logs.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39666-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tomorrow you'll spend a lot of time in
the codings. It'll be fun.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39726-0
<v Ricky Horton>But are you only going?
Usually we take from stock stuff.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39726-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do you guys have a pretty good inventory
and then we're using take from stock and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39726-2
<v Ricky Horton>time to put stuff in the job or you're
not doing that? Yeah, I'd say we are.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39726-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's been a little stagnant since we lost
our main material and haven't looked at</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39726-4
<v Ricky Horton>inventory before us, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39737-0
<v Ricky Horton>We do.
We try to do anything that totally</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39737-1
<v Ricky Horton>updates the verifications because if we
can save, you know, we try to take the,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39737-2
<v Ricky Horton>sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39743-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sorry. So is this what? What is?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39763-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that the 20th right there?
So there's base.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39763-1
<v Ricky Horton>So this would be base hours plus that.
So is this what we need to say that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39763-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39797-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, basically the estimate.
And then that's your actual hours,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39797-1
<v Ricky Horton>correct? Is that for multiple jobs?
If you go back to the tech,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39797-2
<v Ricky Horton>this is for the marketing that we just
looked. Oh, oh,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39797-3
<v Ricky Horton>finally got one different for instance 85,
not designed for you, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39797-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's not right on.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39817-0
<v Ricky Horton>He only did one page. I like this.
This is one board that I was expecting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39817-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I was expecting.
I see multiplexes. You got to tell me.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39817-2
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's pretty damn good though. Yeah,
I can see.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39859-0
<v Ricky Horton>I feel like where's history you both did
a good job.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39859-1
<v Ricky Horton>They have a pretty standard dwelling time.
I was trying to say that I try to get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39859-2
<v Ricky Horton>them to know that position for size,
you know, based off of what we have,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39859-3
<v Ricky Horton>like this past month,
he just upgraded all the things that</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39859-4
<v Ricky Horton>continue ability.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39864-0
<v Ricky Horton>That we can. Let's go. Yeah,
that's it wasn't. That's what.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39913-0
<v Ricky Horton>That'll be the one thing that usually
gets us cause I think was great except in</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39913-1
<v Ricky Horton>my opinion for the CJDS cause some
estimators are overloaded.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39913-2
<v Ricky Horton>They'll do a stigma task and I'm like
this is a 3 inch plan or something.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39913-3
<v Ricky Horton>You guys took over a CJD on one side of
the page.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39922-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, you know,
it's like you got a whole bunch of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39922-1
<v Ricky Horton>cabbage.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39942-0
<v Ricky Horton>Exactly. Clean up and it's ground flows.
How you doing? Yeah, like,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39942-1
<v Ricky Horton>are you guys getting golden connections
here? Yes. Yeah, those estimated. Well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39942-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, it should be CJP multiple correct.
Yeah, it should be 13% on CPU.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39943-0
<v Ricky Horton>H.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39944-0
<v Ricky Horton>Speak.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39960-0
<v Ricky Horton>See,
This is why Alan takes so long to get</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39960-1
<v Ricky Horton>work back to work.
Next meeting would be and next meeting.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/39960-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's better.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40005-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is Ronald House, you guys.
This is hello. OK,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40005-1
<v Ricky Horton>because specifically since we've been
doing our migration,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40005-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's been a bumpy Rd.
for the last three months. I mean,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40005-3
<v Ricky Horton>you've been here for me. How many?
Did you have any issues last week?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40022-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not doing anything big in terms of
little, right? Right.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40022-1
<v Ricky Horton>But just it takes a long time and
sometimes we'll have service issues</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40022-2
<v Ricky Horton>because we're out here, you know,
Internet will crash and you will be down</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40022-3
<v Ricky Horton>for that, you know what I mean? Sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40027-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like you need to have Starlink on
your desk. Yeah, I mean, thanks.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40027-1
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40028-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40049-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
It's not a chance where I'm comfortable</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40049-1
<v Ricky Horton>last week.
I grabbed one with some panic on that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40049-2
<v Ricky Horton>No kidding, he did,
but I still need to stand up because it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40049-3
<v Ricky Horton>kind of can't support.
It's this simple one of those over here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40080-0
<v Ricky Horton>What time are you starting on me? OK,
we'll be in here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40080-1

I did run across next 10 minutes away.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40118-1
<v Ricky Horton>I did that today because I ran a
department over 7 months and we got ready</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40118-2
<v Ricky Horton>to buy a Honda and then I got a call and

fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/40161-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we negotiate.

<v Ricky Horton>Let's go see what the estimate is now.
Let's go see what the estimate was now.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41024-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41062-0
<v Ricky Horton>Beans area.
I was continually going to home on these</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41062-1
<v Ricky Horton>little shops,
but we're going to buy the columns over</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41062-2
<v Ricky Horton>here and the beans over there and stairs
over there. Yeah, there's there's three,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41062-3
<v Ricky Horton>three of them.
So it's the boys have 5D adaptable and</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41062-4
<v Ricky Horton>the shoot.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41066-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, go back to the production from the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41067-0
<v Ricky Horton>The team.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hold on a second.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41073-0
<v Ricky Horton>See the same as this one.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41086-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the total hours is like 434600.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41089-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's 1800.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41092-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why not the right move, baby?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41095-0
<v Ricky Horton>11,000, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41097-0
<v Ricky Horton>8400.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41103-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I don't understand how.
How's that so far?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41120-0
<v Ricky Horton>Alright,
so we have to reestimated from one to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41120-1
<v Ricky Horton>take off those because then it's be
cheaper than the pricing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41133-0
<v Ricky Horton>I bet you see that's like 2.
42 hours per ton of you over.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41133-1
<v Ricky Horton>This just wasn't labored out.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41141-0
<v Ricky Horton>You see the the rest of the guests a
little bit.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41142-0
<v Ricky Horton>So 7.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41143-0
<v Ricky Horton>Repeat.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41152-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hit see see the filters on the.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41176-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the same job.
There's something graphically changed.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41176-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's the hours per ton.
This was drastically different.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41176-2
<v Ricky Horton>Go back to that one that was 2 point
whatever hours per ton.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41185-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go to labor code on the left hand side on
the filters.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41210-0
<v Ricky Horton>And open that up. Yeah.
So it's not labored.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41210-1
<v Ricky Horton>It A is the default on this that
basically handling and cutting and that's</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41210-2
<v Ricky Horton>it. This doesn't have any labor to it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41218-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it would be somewhere else in
another estimate meeting,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41218-1
<v Ricky Horton>reach out to the estimate meeting, so.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41224-0
<v Ricky Horton>She can't smile at issues.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41245-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's another reason we haven't really
obviously something that's on our list to</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41245-1
<v Ricky Horton>delete this back. Yeah,
obviously that's correctly. Yep,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41245-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's great.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41259-0
<v Ricky Horton>For sure.
I think we had just left when they're</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41259-1
<v Ricky Horton>basically helping. They have to be an org.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41297-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then I said, hey,
let me see your last three years worth of.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41297-1
<v Ricky Horton>So nominal. What's that nominal?
Something. It's it's why the other days.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41297-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see your last three years worth of
estimates versus actuals. They go,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41297-3
<v Ricky Horton>what do you mean? They go, well,
I want to see, you know.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41334-0
<v Ricky Horton>Drafting hours, shop hours,
give it out and you have to spend, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41334-1
<v Ricky Horton>And they go, we don't have that. They go,
what do you have? This is,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41334-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can tell you this job 800 last night.
That's all.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41334-3
<v Ricky Horton>You can't tell me if it's made money or
last money because people are already got</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41334-4
<v Ricky Horton>shop hours.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41366-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or material. No. Oh, great.
So I implemented the last couple of</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41366-1
<v Ricky Horton>months. Dude,
you have to have that job costing,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41366-2
<v Ricky Horton>real job costing,
and you have to have estimates.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41366-3
<v Ricky Horton>The owners of the company,
you only have that been for 35 years.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41404-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah,
this cheap land looks about 75 bucks a</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41404-1
<v Ricky Horton>square foot and this handrail is 500
bucks the land a foot. OK, well,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41404-2
<v Ricky Horton>where's the computer right now? How much?
We just know this is what we can sell it</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41404-3
<v Ricky Horton>for.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41441-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's been 5 years now we've been doing.
So in the last seven months,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41441-1
<v Ricky Horton>all I did was implement job passing
program and fix their estimating and I</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41441-2
<v Ricky Horton>left at my board because I want to come
back home, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41441-3
<v Ricky Horton>So when I turned in my notice two or
three weeks ago, he said,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41441-4
<v Ricky Horton>what can you do is come favor?
What's that?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41474-0
<v Ricky Horton>They also had five estimators,
all 5 estimators in different labour</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41474-1
<v Ricky Horton>rates in different markets.
So it completely screwed it up, right?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41474-2
<v Ricky Horton>From scale and location, he said.
Can you give you our estimators and kind</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41474-3
<v Ricky Horton>of say on those three guys? Sure.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41522-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I have time studies that I have
personally made-up since it takes this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41522-1
<v Ricky Horton>many minutes for folks to do a a wire for
them to take one of this many minutes for</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41522-2
<v Ricky Horton>folks to do a take one of this many
minutes for work to do a Polish this many</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41522-3
<v Ricky Horton>minutes to do this many minutes to make a
panel on which should bend,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41522-4
<v Ricky Horton>should form it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41570-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's been as much time.
So I made a cheat sheet off of my memory</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41570-1
<v Ricky Horton>and I said I would use these times and I
would actually enter the measured costs</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41570-2
<v Ricky Horton>and shop fabrication times and erection
times all based on the things that I've</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41570-3
<v Ricky Horton>given you. And so now they're doing that,
but they wanted me to explain all that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41611-0
<v Ricky Horton>The day before my last day,
it's like I was very friendly and I could</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41611-1
<v Ricky Horton>actually go back to work there,
but I was really trying to get these guys</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41611-2
<v Ricky Horton>up to the 20th century.
So you get a great shape to wear it back.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41635-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's not the hard part of me.
That's awesome though.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41635-1
<v Ricky Horton>You said it was a 1099. No, no, I had it.
I was working as a as an employee, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41670-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but I actually offered to estimate or</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41670-1
<v Ricky Horton>consult for them after I left,
because it does not conflict with what</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41670-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to do is polished brass,
polished stainless are a real super</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41670-3
<v Ricky Horton>trusted. If you guys don't do that here.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41681-0
<v Ricky Horton>By often they didn't take me up on it,
which is fine, but like, you know,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41681-1
<v Ricky Horton>it might, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41696-0
<v Ricky Horton>Personally, bring your chair.
You're on the screen.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41696-1
<v Ricky Horton>You should talk to somebody.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41720-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, $300 chair. Yeah, a good one.
Mine's like found like 7 bucks. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41720-1
<v Ricky Horton>like a $25 Costco room.
It was funny before.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41749-0
<v Ricky Horton>They used to.
I'm going to fix that tomorrow.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41749-1
<v Ricky Horton>Bring some good ones.
I just bought a chair for a home,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41749-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I looked at the most comfortable
office chair is Aaron's chair.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41799-0
<v Ricky Horton>$1750 So I started looking for used ones.
I found one for the 400 bucks last</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41799-1
<v Ricky Horton>weekend and bought a big home.
Is it the best chair you're going to sell?</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41799-2
<v Ricky Horton>You know what? It's pretty damn close.
My wife's bad.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41799-3
<v Ricky Horton>Can you pay 400 bucks for a chair?
I paid $400 for a $1700 chair for a used</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41799-4
<v Ricky Horton>chair.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41804-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. But you know what?
It's real comfortable.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41832-0
<v Ricky Horton>It does. So this job is wrong, right?
We're missing information.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41832-1
<v Ricky Horton>Looks like I'll have that information
full waiting for the estimator every</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41832-2
<v Ricky Horton>second scene, but.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41866-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we done today. Looks like it. Yeah.
See you guys in the morning.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41866-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be here 7,
maybe 7:30 in the workshop.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41866-2
<v Ricky Horton>I need to come on. Thanks, Sir.
And by the way, I hope nothing.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41905-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would like to look at it to see if we
have a disagreement because I was going</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41905-1
<v Ricky Horton>to bring it up, but no, we'll be good.
It was all good. Appreciate it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41905-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'd like to.
I'll screw up something like that.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41905-3
<v Ricky Horton>One person that threw me out, I guess,
is we had a conversation with.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41936-0
<v Ricky Horton>With Jim Blair and we lost that
discussion. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41936-1
<v Ricky Horton>but he knew Jim Blair and I.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41964-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do not make that dial. Yeah, I see that.
I never. Yeah,</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41964-1
<v Ricky Horton>it was one of the things where.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41984-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because even more like this is what's
happening.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41984-1
<v Ricky Horton>What is it you can take it or you're not
going to have any business in the valley.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/41984-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's small. I really have it.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42005-0
<v Ricky Horton>Smoothly. Yeah. Not more into.
Let's try to work together to fix this</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42005-1
<v Ricky Horton>one and that's it.
It's all looking forward.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42005-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's just the same.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42014-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's good.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42035-0
<v Ricky Horton>You too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I see a lot of videos. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42035-1
<v Ricky Horton>Jason, he said. He's looking up. You know,
he's all over. I've got stuff for.</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42064-0
<v Ricky Horton>Clients send me questions. I'm like,
I've answered the same question five</v>
fbb3b0ff-8658-461b-940f-caf4aec8740f/42064-1
