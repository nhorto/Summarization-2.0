a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/58-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's they're doing really good like

<v Ricky Horton>And it's Vivaldi's. Oh,

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/89-1
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I'll be talking about it.
I was gonna be here, though. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/89-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's dope. So in January,
we're gonna do it with the bad budget</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/89-3
<v Ricky Horton>review, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/93-0
<v Ricky Horton>Super cool. Candlelight.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/109-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is their extra meeting.
We weren't allowed to record during the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/109-1
<v Ricky Horton>summer in autumn and winter, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/124-0
<v Ricky Horton>But these, these are worse, right?
But these are better. If they're worse,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/124-1
<v Ricky Horton>when you're rolling, I'm just afraid.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/128-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, thank you. Appreciate it.
It seems like meetings.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/134-0
<v Ricky Horton>Reminders inside. God,
it's a big what I did.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/152-0
<v Ricky Horton>I was just letting you guys know the AI
St. audit is what it's going to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/152-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure it's going to be our key people.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/156-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/170-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're glad we did that. Yeah,
Alan will say it. I'll just go over here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/172-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
see any books you find property though.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/188-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was, yeah,
it was 22 degrees close and then and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/188-1
<v Ricky Horton>severe winter's strong one.
They have a lot of you. Good morning.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/188-2
<v Ricky Horton>How are you? Good this morning.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/189-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/190-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/191-0
<v Ricky Horton>Partnership.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/196-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unforgive me.
I'll see you later in a while.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/225-0
<v Ricky Horton>He said they're not an update right now,
so he's still they're trying to duplicate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/225-1
<v Ricky Horton>the entire database in a separate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/251-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they explain that's why everything's
super slow. It's a simple, easy process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/251-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just the pretty quick. Yeah, yeah,
that's quick. So I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/288-0
<v Ricky Horton>They started the process last Thursday,
so excuse I'll that's our excuse at this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/288-1
<v Ricky Horton>point. I could show you right now.
I'll have because I will told would be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/288-2
<v Ricky Horton>there, you know, about that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/295-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't have minutes.
That's that's kind of what I thought.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/295-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's right now. Dave. Yeah, so, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/320-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
there's there's these kind of if you want</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/320-1
<v Ricky Horton>to swap through that. OK, can we get one?
No, this one's all right. This is bad.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/320-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to test these out today.
It's not a steel officer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/320-3
<v Ricky Horton>This ain't intentionally what I sent them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/336-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's getting down to it.
So and they've been following this to a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/336-1
<v Ricky Horton>tee allegedly, so I.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/367-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm unsure where the hiccups are coming
in now, like the SQL Service manager.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/367-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like I have had an issue with it like not
doing the naming,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/367-2
<v Ricky Horton>but afterwards there's like the naming.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/408-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think copies it and does everything
right. I have to mean it. But yeah, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/408-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's exactly what it's going to be
right there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/408-2
<v Ricky Horton>And I've been waiting for them to give me
the new port number and I followed up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/408-3
<v Ricky Horton>this morning and I was like, Oh yeah, no,
that's not done yet. I was like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/431-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've been working on this since Thursday.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/431-1
<v Ricky Horton>give me access to SQL and I'll just take
a while. I have it. But yeah, we have,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/431-2
<v Ricky Horton>we have. All right,
you have access to the server there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/462-0
<v Ricky Horton>I wish. Also, I sure they have a bill.
They don't trust me with that. Yeah. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/462-1
<v Ricky Horton>the guy that it does is sitting in my
office right now. Oh, yeah. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/462-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can show a lot of bill if you also
might be your need. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/462-3
<v Ricky Horton>something important for me to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/494-0
<v Ricky Horton>He's over here, definitely.
Then at least you know the plugin is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/494-1
<v Ricky Horton>admin.
So looks like the main goal for today for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/494-2
<v Ricky Horton>the morning is inventory clean up taking
stocks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/528-0
<v Ricky Horton>My P OS review and answer questions.
Finish the taking stock clean up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/528-1
<v Ricky Horton>So a good portion of our taking stock
clean up is being cleaned up and they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/528-2
<v Ricky Horton>putting umbrella so loaded just because
there's some videos that are unfinalized.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/556-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this was over 1,000,000 pounds before.
Yep,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/556-1
<v Ricky Horton>now our on order weight still reflects
the same as because of that and and I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/556-2
<v Ricky Horton>guess one thing that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/589-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty sure there isn't.
There isn't a way to batch funds and SP</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/589-1
<v Ricky Horton>OS. It's all right.
So I had one client who had not finalized</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/589-2
<v Ricky Horton>in five years and so they had some tool
that they used.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/617-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's almost like a script they wrote.
Yeah, there wasn't a script.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/617-1
<v Ricky Horton>There was some,
there was some programs that you can sit</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/617-2
<v Ricky Horton>in there and I'll see if I can find it.
But he he he basically.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/651-0
<v Ricky Horton>Showed it or trained it how to finalize
and he turned it off when I came back to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/651-1
<v Ricky Horton>the next door. In fact, he just,
he just left it so that every night when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/651-2
<v Ricky Horton>they left and finalized all their ideas
from that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/651-3
<v Ricky Horton>they say they like to do it here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/661-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, ma'am, I can't think who that was.
Let me see if I can find that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/675-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yesterday's meeting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/684-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/710-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I'll have to figure out who that was,
cause I actually not remember who that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/710-1
<v Ricky Horton>was. Man, it was really sweet. Yeah,
it was quick, but otherwise, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/710-2
<v Ricky Horton>it is PO dot PO. You gotta go with the D.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/711-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/720-0
<v Ricky Horton>Dang, I can picture the guy.
I can't think of where he is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/743-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have to find that and see if I can
and and and then you got to figure out</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/743-1
<v Ricky Horton>how to use it too 'cause it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/778-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's a program that's comes on the
you like create short pass and stuff like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/778-1
<v Ricky Horton>the dude was getting like control T or
something like that and it was it was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/778-2
<v Ricky Horton>running stuff impact from what we just
trying to do certain things.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/778-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's pretty cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/782-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not Power BI. No, it wasn't Power BI.
Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/800-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I'll I'll have to figure out who that was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/800-1
<v Ricky Horton>and find it. I I don't remember,
but if I can, I'll figure that out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/805-0
<v Ricky Horton>See.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/812-0
<v Ricky Horton>I thought random.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/838-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll have to look. I don't.
I can't find it right off the top. So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/838-1
<v Ricky Horton>So why are these PO open POS?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/849-0
<v Ricky Horton>These are videos from the whole projects
and I guess we never really got it as a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/849-1
<v Ricky Horton>portal or.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/881-0
<v Ricky Horton>Procedures to go back in and finalize and
approve them formally in the system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/881-1
<v Ricky Horton>So as you said,
I mean close the purchase orders as fully</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/881-2
<v Ricky Horton>received.
Can you show us something like what do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/881-3
<v Ricky Horton>you mean by that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/913-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So,
so basically this is a purchase order</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/913-1
<v Ricky Horton>that has been fully received at this
point and everything that's been on has</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/913-2
<v Ricky Horton>been cut off with the exception of the
buy items because not associated, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/921-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
anything that's great out been associated</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/921-1
<v Ricky Horton>with a couple of stuff can be used. Uh,
so on here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/956-0
<v Ricky Horton>We would just have to essentially for the
PO process follow this all the way</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/956-1
<v Ricky Horton>through,
finalize the items in here so they no</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/956-2
<v Ricky Horton>longer show on the order in our inventory
system and then approve the purchase</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/956-3
<v Ricky Horton>order which would then be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/984-0
<v Ricky Horton>This can't be edited out to this point
unless you go in and unlock it and roll</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/984-1
<v Ricky Horton>with approval.
So with us having the the main issue that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/984-2
<v Ricky Horton>this wasn't added to our.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1036-0
<v Ricky Horton>Process flow initially was this was a
duplicate of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1036-1
<v Ricky Horton>We originally used to do all of our
purchase orders in and that was our</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1036-2
<v Ricky Horton>governing guide and then this was a
duplicate so that we could generally cut</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1036-3
<v Ricky Horton>this and handle all the data.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1079-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then with us switching to Vista,
not necessarily the same thing as we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1079-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't have to break out the line items
and Vista like we were previously</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1079-2
<v Ricky Horton>referred to and throw over.
Now it's just pulling the number and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1079-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're tracking the actual details of the
purchase order in here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1126-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's something that we just need to
add to our process of once we are now in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1126-1
<v Ricky Horton>place in order,
once we know that it's received and I've</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1126-2
<v Ricky Horton>been adding this as a task to shipping
and receiving the received of the final</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1126-3
<v Ricky Horton>item, they could finalize the PO and the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1148-0
<v Ricky Horton>Either me and Tom can go on and approve
it or the shipping's right there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1148-1
<v Ricky Horton>The process is super easy.
They can go ahead and go ahead and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1148-2
<v Ricky Horton>finalize it.
Do you have companies of P OS that are in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1148-3
<v Ricky Horton>this state? Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1183-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's where,
that's where if we go into inventory</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1183-1
<v Ricky Horton>right now and we see weight on order is 1,
063,145 lbs in here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1183-2
<v Ricky Horton>but what we actually have for stock.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1217-0
<v Ricky Horton>That is either off the grams or order
materials that have not been processed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1217-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's why the stock and the order number
are not matching. Technically,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1217-2
<v Ricky Horton>we want those to be matching if we're
following this process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1223-0
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so there's a half million pounds on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1223-1
<v Ricky Horton>site somewhere.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1239-0
<v Ricky Horton>In theory, yes. So where the reality is,
reality is probably,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1239-1
<v Ricky Horton>I guess I'd say it's pretty close.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1243-0
<v Ricky Horton>Plus or minus 100,000 pounds.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1245-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1271-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what is that? That's like backlog.
That's what? Yeah, backlog and or I can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1271-1
<v Ricky Horton>I see.
It's actual inventory that you guys</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1271-2
<v Ricky Horton>brought against. Yeah, if I go into.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1288-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is this the inventory that drives the
system or is this the inventory drives</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1288-1
<v Ricky Horton>the system? No, this is right here.
This is the so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1318-0
<v Ricky Horton>So whenever our SOP operators have a
usable RAM outside of our or within our</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1318-1
<v Ricky Horton>guidelines, so 137,
000 of confirmed stop in the yard of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1318-2
<v Ricky Horton>usable RAMs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1352-0
<v Ricky Horton>The other stuff is either rejected
remnants from active projects in system</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1352-1
<v Ricky Horton>or is allocated to a cut list and is
upcoming.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1352-2
<v Ricky Horton>I know that TSMCI have all those
materials entered in here and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1365-0
<v Ricky Horton>No TSMC Fab 3,
that's like 169 time in the project,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1365-1
<v Ricky Horton>so that will show in our stock as
incoming, not necessarily see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1366-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1390-0
<v Ricky Horton>I I sent you an e-mail on it.
It's called Auto Hot Key and the guy sent</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1390-1
<v Ricky Horton>me a couple videos you can watch there.
It shows how to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1392-0
<v Ricky Horton>In fact.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1399-0
<v Ricky Horton>ChatGPT show me all the scripts to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1402-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you probably need access.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
especially if it's a new program</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1437-1
<v Ricky Horton>downloaded.
That's where I'm going to pull up,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1437-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I have to report Keith,
so you don't say anything I need,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1437-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it's going to help us.
I can get downloaded. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1437-4
<v Ricky Horton>he sent me the executive order to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1449-0
<v Ricky Horton>But evidently he took it down or it
expired. Yeah, it it expired already,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1449-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I'll e-mail and see if he'll put it
back up for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1479-0
<v Ricky Horton>And is it? Is it version specific?
I don't know really anything about what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1479-1
<v Ricky Horton>he built that is that I'll document
things.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1479-2
<v Ricky Horton>I really think that it probably would not
be version specific, yes or no.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1480-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1500-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because the process is I'm assigned in
this so it's the last million years,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1500-1
<v Ricky Horton>so that we have no way of truly tracking.
It's gonna be all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1530-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but and that would be the best way to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1530-1
<v Ricky Horton>look at it is inventory stop.
It doesn't work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1530-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's just that it doesn't move it just
because you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1556-0
<v Ricky Horton>No. So once it's received and finalized,
then like you said, right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1556-1
<v Ricky Horton>you have to finalize. Yeah,
until once it's just received by like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1556-2
<v Ricky Horton>because our current process,
we have to see which receives it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1556-3
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't include it from time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1593-0
<v Ricky Horton>That order, yeah, number, right. Yeah.
Which for reason of like us wanting to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1593-1
<v Ricky Horton>utilize,
it would probably be like a hopefully we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1593-2
<v Ricky Horton>have on order both.
We don't have a true keeper to check that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1593-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, pretty much.
And and I mean with all the stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1633-0
<v Ricky Horton>It'll become valuable if we're running
lots of jobs and we're trying to,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1633-1
<v Ricky Horton>since we have limited yard space and then
we have a decent amount of space,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1633-2
<v Ricky Horton>but once that starts building up,
being able to look forward as a we have a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1633-3
<v Ricky Horton>project coming in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1680-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is what we show in stock.
This is what we show on order.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1680-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're projecting another 300 tons of
steel coming in and this is already a new</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1680-2
<v Ricky Horton>purchase orders in the system,
but not received yet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1680-3
<v Ricky Horton>We know that we're going to have to try
and figure out looking for 300,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1680-4
<v Ricky Horton>000 tons of steel. So in order 600,
that's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1707-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would help our guys for sure,
knowing where their material was at and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1707-1
<v Ricky Horton>and obviously like not having to worry
about a place to put it, but yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1707-2
<v Ricky Horton>like for me it feels like a shipping.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1747-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like the benefited mostly to any forecast
where they can make things out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1747-1
<v Ricky Horton>Where is it?
We're talking about inventory.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1747-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're talking about necessarily about
locations,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1747-3
<v Ricky Horton>but for us so can you show so because
what what I wanted to make bin location</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1747-4
<v Ricky Horton>down in the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1773-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, it was. It was. It's it's not now,
but we we also have readjusted it once</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1773-1
<v Ricky Horton>and now we have the five acres and what I
started to do is do overlays of whip bins</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1773-2
<v Ricky Horton>and bin like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1806-0
<v Ricky Horton>Inventory some locations for for this
very reason. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1806-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then other things to it too. Yeah.
So that's what we're going to move to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1806-2
<v Ricky Horton>Once this area is done,
I want to sit down with Mark and uh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1806-3
<v Ricky Horton>most likely to get about the battle
between.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1836-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I can't have a, I can't, I can't,
I can't create these locations.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1836-1
<v Ricky Horton>The player for space is really good,
but really good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1836-2
<v Ricky Horton>But what this would follow is to show
like how much material we already have in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1836-3
<v Ricky Horton>stock and how much material we also are
projecting to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1870-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yep. But with us not finalizing,
so we're like currently, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1870-1
<v Ricky Horton>a piece of material comes in and
receiving takes the heat under applies it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1870-2
<v Ricky Horton>to the system to show that it's receiving
attaches the document into our and that's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1870-3
<v Ricky Horton>pretty much the extended process, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1874-0
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't remove it from the delete
order.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1916-0
<v Ricky Horton>There.
So like right now we show that we have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1916-1
<v Ricky Horton>one point. We don't have that,
but because that purchase order isn't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1916-2
<v Ricky Horton>finalized,
that's actually the last piece that you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1916-3
<v Ricky Horton>received, it still shows.
Does that trigger your controller like is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1916-4
<v Ricky Horton>it your controller?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1932-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't have licenses. They're not.
They don't worry about how much inventory</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1932-1
<v Ricky Horton>you guys they're actually carry or don't
carry, no.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1980-0
<v Ricky Horton>Inventory on steel is already more or
less true through the job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1980-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't know why it still should be in
the inventory,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1980-2
<v Ricky Horton>but steel should be doing the balance and
everything else. If they want to do that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1980-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't, I don't understand it. Yeah,
I don't think that number is reflective</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/1980-4
<v Ricky Horton>of the file.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2006-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's stuff that isn't finalized because
like the line that we're on,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2006-1
<v Ricky Horton>you see the selected line says 08.
It was 22 gauge,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2006-2
<v Ricky Horton>just doesn't have a weight yet in the
system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2006-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm thinking that doesn't reflect the
number that of the stuff that isn't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2006-4
<v Ricky Horton>finalized.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2011-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's 241927.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2020-0
<v Ricky Horton>B2B does have volume. So yeah,
just don't like much.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2027-0
<v Ricky Horton>1.25 lbs a square foot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2028-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2029-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2030-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2036-0
<v Ricky Horton>The white.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2055-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, on order, I think is the same there.
Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2055-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that is reflective of what the system
sees us on order.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2081-0
<v Ricky Horton>So either there is a lot of, there is 1.
1 million lbs on water or else there's a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2081-1
<v Ricky Horton>bunch on EA's that just that.
So one of the two.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2086-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, I would really let me check on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2090-0
<v Ricky Horton>I will do jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2091-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2112-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is there stuff in here that on P OS that
is not steal?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2112-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like sometimes people will order paint
and stuff and they should never receive</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2112-2
<v Ricky Horton>it. Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2114-0
<v Ricky Horton>Chance as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2142-0
<v Ricky Horton>And one big one that I've seen in the
past is test jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2142-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like when we've had trainees or new
employees.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2144-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like this, like that one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2147-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2155-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the steel that will never be received
in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2157-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2165-0
<v Ricky Horton>So at that point you can just delete that,
yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2211-0
<v Ricky Horton>What I don't understand is what we have
interiors in here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2211-1
<v Ricky Horton>whether it's not outstanding.
So why do you guys run test stuff on a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2211-2
<v Ricky Horton>test environment?
I'm used to the database,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2211-3
<v Ricky Horton>which the whole company runs off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2223-0
<v Ricky Horton>But we do training all the time.
We would just go into a test company and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2223-1
<v Ricky Horton>do training in a test company and not
commingle.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2247-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those two entities don't do any training
in the real company.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2247-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's easy to delete them out.
We can get them in and delete all that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2247-2
<v Ricky Horton>out. What is the standard? I mean,
but there's next 10 units probably.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2248-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2252-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not messing with your data.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2255-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I definitely.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2257-0
<v Ricky Horton>The uh the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2296-0
<v Ricky Horton>A huge portion of us not because we've
we've only ever ran with the with the one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2296-1
<v Ricky Horton>company in here and with us creating the
new electrical database and so we've</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2296-2
<v Ricky Horton>never really had a testing environment
that we've ever implemented.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2301-0
<v Ricky Horton>So uh,
that's that's probably an issue there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2324-0
<v Ricky Horton>These it's not.
I think there's only the PO itself.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2324-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think it'll let me with these
items being it should. It should.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2324-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's also not finalized or anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2329-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, bro. Good to leave if you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2338-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I cut this or cut off from whatever
whatever was associated with it, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2346-0
<v Ricky Horton>But in theory,
considering that mass appeal just cleared</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2346-1
<v Ricky Horton>out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2384-0
<v Ricky Horton>49 and the 7000 so even that doesn't make
sense because that one order was only</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2384-1
<v Ricky Horton>showing 87 right? I don't know man,
that was a hell of an RFQ or a hell of a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2384-2
<v Ricky Horton>Pl. So but but I I don't agree but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2387-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which shown 8787,000 lbs. So how would we?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2413-0
<v Ricky Horton>Both of them were selected and there was
80,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2413-1
<v Ricky Horton>000 pounds of oh wait that I deleted out
and nobody freaks out about those numbers</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2413-2
<v Ricky Horton>being there. No,
nobody sees me and I right now to look at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2413-3
<v Ricky Horton>it, honestly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2446-0
<v Ricky Horton>So ideally with us pushing towards this
integration,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2446-1
<v Ricky Horton>we'll track and push some of our purchase
service back and forth between some of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2446-2
<v Ricky Horton>our material purchases because I know
that they're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2473-0
<v Ricky Horton>Their ideal goal with our syncing Vista
is to sync labor codes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2473-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty sure that's not an option at
this point as of yet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2473-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we talked a little bit about that
yesterday and my understanding from what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2473-3
<v Ricky Horton>you explained it is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2510-0
<v Ricky Horton>Technically pushing into this,
but just as a question, is that correct?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2510-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the only thing technically pushing into</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2510-2
<v Ricky Horton>this is PA use, PA receipts,
and then transactions.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2510-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we still are going to do that same
thing we already currently have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2510-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's a push that doesn't have to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2538-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a, you know, for, yeah, yeah,
it's just to create an import export in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2538-1
<v Ricky Horton>the background. So,
but it takes human intervention to force</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2538-2
<v Ricky Horton>it or it just once it's entered,
it actually narrows it over.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2538-3
<v Ricky Horton>You can set it up now and do it all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2572-0
<v Ricky Horton>So,
but the or you what are you guys doing?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2572-1
<v Ricky Horton>Are you physically pushing for for like,
so let's say you're a PO.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2572-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are you physically pushing POS in the
Vista? No. How?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2572-3
<v Ricky Horton>How do you get it in the Vista?
You can manually get to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2611-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we go in weeks creation of the PO.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2611-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's what we talked about yesterday.
We have to create the PO and generate it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2611-2
<v Ricky Horton>in Vista to get the PO number. Yeah,
take that PO number,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2611-3
<v Ricky Horton>then create the PO in Tecla and take it
in. I got you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2611-4
<v Ricky Horton>I remember that conversation. Yeah,
it's true.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2629-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess my thing is,
is would there be the could could we take</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2629-1
<v Ricky Horton>it from Tecla and have Tecla just create
whatever PO number it is right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2675-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just start a PO1, just work our way down,
right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2675-1
<v Ricky Horton>But then when it pushes it into Vista,
have Vista create the PO that it needs to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2675-2
<v Ricky Horton>port it.
It'll only pull whatever information type</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2675-3
<v Ricky Horton>tells it. Yeah,
it'll that's the PO number in Vista, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2696-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's where it's like, either way,
we're still gonna have to go into Vista,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2696-1
<v Ricky Horton>create the PO just to get the stupid PO
number that they want, which that sucks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2740-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I don't have my company number.
It's what's the company number? It's well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2740-1
<v Ricky Horton>our POS are 41, so the 36, yeah,
because they closed out company 36 when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2740-2
<v Ricky Horton>our company 41. That's a PO number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2765-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can't be because I we got orders for 42
liter, but it keeps going on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2765-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll start with a 49 instead of a three.
So it's not just three.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2791-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think we got to that point here.
Well, we will.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2791-1
<v Ricky Horton>We eventually will and that's fine. Yeah.
No, that's all right. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2791-2
<v Ricky Horton>Outside of my view green on that one,
that's for sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2817-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but I'm here as whether it would.
Yeah, once again,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2817-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't don't break something if this is
working,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2817-2
<v Ricky Horton>but if I'm wondering if it would kick it
over, kick the information over there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2821-0
<v Ricky Horton>If uh, it was already created in Vista.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2859-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, do you have to double receipt?
No, it's interested in that club.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2859-1
<v Ricky Horton>They don't.
And what close is it out in Vista? I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2859-2
<v Ricky Horton>once they send their big problem,
they pay still asking this question.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2904-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're bringing stuff on PO's in Vista and
then we're not receiving it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2904-1
<v Ricky Horton>bringing it in and then they and then how
do we backlash it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2904-2
<v Ricky Horton>We so with Pro 4 they used to verify,
right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2904-3
<v Ricky Horton>They used to make sure that it was
received, but now they're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2904-4
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what their process is
foundation with our.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2927-0
<v Ricky Horton>And stuff like that, right? Yeah,
this is what I that stuff is supposed to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2927-1
<v Ricky Horton>happen.
Tech doesn't look like a piggyback to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2927-2
<v Ricky Horton>that, you know,
the accounting side of things, not so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2936-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's a very. This isn't.
This isn't necessarily.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2978-0
<v Ricky Horton>Approving it though,
showing that it's been received.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2978-1
<v Ricky Horton>At least that's not the way it was
explained to me. This is exactly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2978-2
<v Ricky Horton>I go through these.
I have my purchase order.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2978-3
<v Ricky Horton>If they invoice me for something that
I've already received or something that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/2978-4
<v Ricky Horton>we haven't received yet,
I will decline decline.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3001-0
<v Ricky Horton>I will not allow them to dig the inside
so you can find those over the top.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3001-1
<v Ricky Horton>You have two types of approval.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3044-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So the other one's like, yeah, OK.
So like Gavin was just explaining,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3044-1
<v Ricky Horton>this is our check, I guess,
of these would be orders that we place.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3044-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yep, which I get. But here's my,
that's the thing,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3044-3
<v Ricky Horton>but but sometimes they send over from.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some for approval and sometimes they
don't. You get more than I do, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-1
<v Ricky Horton>And I know for sure I'm placing more
still orders than you are now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's like there's no reason.
Bank not only should, I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-3
<v Ricky Horton>you should not only get mine also,
you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-4
<v Ricky Horton>like you you should be getting mine and I
should be getting mine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3099-5
<v Ricky Horton>And once you see that I've approved it,
you know that I've gone through my check.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3135-0
<v Ricky Horton>To make sure that it's been received,
make sure that we aren't getting</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3135-1
<v Ricky Horton>overcharged. But like,
I get it once for paint, like for sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3135-2
<v Ricky Horton>And that's about the extent of it. Like,
yeah, no, I get billing, I get paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3135-3
<v Ricky Horton>I get any random order and once I approve
them, then they go to March.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3171-0
<v Ricky Horton>But Mark usually just pushes them to make
sure everything shines with what we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3171-1
<v Ricky Horton>originally went for. Good point.
So but that that is there if you ever be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3171-2
<v Ricky Horton>appointed it it will do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3208-0
<v Ricky Horton>The PO of receiving annual.
So that's why things are absolute. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3208-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's definitely something we're going
to want to use going forward,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3208-2
<v Ricky Horton>but if you still have to go and create
the PO.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3242-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just adding a lot of adding a lot of.
I think that's cover somebody just trying</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3242-1
<v Ricky Horton>to push it. Yeah, I mean,
what's what it should be pretty seamless,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3242-2
<v Ricky Horton>but yeah,
it's there if you need things for me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3257-0
<v Ricky Horton>What we we used to have is something to
wear to tell the videos or whatever and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3257-1
<v Ricky Horton>we push it like into the night,
but I don't feel like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3296-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we've used some new.
We had QuickBooks. We had foundation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3296-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's, yeah, foundation.
Each one's been different of I need to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3296-2
<v Ricky Horton>put specific quantities, material sizes,
lengths when I.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3322-0
<v Ricky Horton>From all the way down to to over here,
I can put it with you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3322-1
<v Ricky Horton>So now you wouldn't need to set up house
codes and or face codes in here that will</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3322-2
<v Ricky Horton>match.
So Pierre would have to have that on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3365-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's where it's a lot of times most
of our base coats for material are</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3365-1
<v Ricky Horton>relatively similar,
but like this elusiveness metal shop,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3365-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna have 60 different sequences
and each sub block is gonna have its own</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3365-3
<v Ricky Horton>material base coat.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3404-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get it there and sequence form lot
one is going to have 083000 dot 01 and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3404-1
<v Ricky Horton>then lot 6 will have the same base code .
09 and it's kind of all over the place.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3404-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, if if the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3441-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can set it up so that shapes have us
have like a false.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3441-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's got your face in in in a Vista.
She set it up so a shape has a default</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3441-2
<v Ricky Horton>one and just pops it on there so that it
was always the same things.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3458-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. But if it changes all the time,
then now you got Monday in the year,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3458-1
<v Ricky Horton>then yeah, it might be back and forth.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3458-2
<v Ricky Horton>it'd be one thing if we had a dedicated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-0
<v Ricky Horton>Accounting personnel that was working the
data back and forth. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's and even then I'm sure that they
would get to the one where they're like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-2
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
we're defining the standard on this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-3
<v Ricky Horton>because this is just ridiculous. Yeah.
So which I don't,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-4
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think it's out to the wrong
because they have a pretty good breakdown</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3512-5
<v Ricky Horton>of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3547-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is what should go here,
and This is why. Yeah, big Excel sheet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3547-1
<v Ricky Horton>It breaks down why these things go to
what? Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3547-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they would just have to expand on
material for surely. Yeah, instead of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3584-0
<v Ricky Horton>Field oriented difference point, yes.
Now the the estimate can you bring me</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3584-1
<v Ricky Horton>down the the the cost is in a year you
can send us an estimate just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3584-2
<v Ricky Horton>automatically breaks it on the cost.
If the cost schedule changes by a lot of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3584-3
<v Ricky Horton>items, that's something you want to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3610-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
I which I'm assuming somebody somewhere</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3610-1
<v Ricky Horton>is taking the estimate and breaking it
down by cost getting anybody to give to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3610-2
<v Ricky Horton>them.
So but the estimate can do that for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3610-3
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
251819 is probably a good example.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3614-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3615-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3638-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have any issues with three drives
this morning? No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3638-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just you didn't want to just read this,
but that's not actually working.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3638-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are you Jada or?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3641-0
<v Ricky Horton>It must have just happened a little bit
earlier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3642-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3648-0
<v Ricky Horton>2025 I shouldn't have to wait this long.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3651-0
<v Ricky Horton>But he sent me a new link.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3680-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I can set that up in the background so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3680-1
<v Ricky Horton>that runs.
I don't think it's a bad idea to have it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3680-2
<v Ricky Horton>as a part of our process.
This is the checks and balance.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3680-3
<v Ricky Horton>But if I can get that automation set up,
yeah, then because it's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3701-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our check process and receiving items in
it's essentially our final step.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3701-1
<v Ricky Horton>We just want it to be clean.
I would rather have it be clean so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3738-0
<v Ricky Horton>And like these guys, when I got there,
when they tried to open up inventory,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3738-1
<v Ricky Horton>it literally took like four or five
minutes to open the inventory because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3738-2
<v Ricky Horton>they had so many line items in there
because then and they were kind of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3775-0
<v Ricky Horton>Fudging it because they had an automatic
filter set for everything greater than 0,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3775-1
<v Ricky Horton>so they never saw it. But they're like,
why is it so? Yeah, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3775-2
<v Ricky Horton>this is a typical, typical breakdown.
Facebook's relatively similar, but then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3779-0
<v Ricky Horton>Different call outs in the back end of it
and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3826-0
<v Ricky Horton>Base codes are generated by Hemington.
Base codes are generated by Ryan Collins.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3826-1
<v Ricky Horton>He takes our estimate exports and then he
associated associates the base codes</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3826-2
<v Ricky Horton>based upon the long rows hierarchy that
they have for the type of labour area of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3826-3
<v Ricky Horton>labour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3828-0
<v Ricky Horton>And associated um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3834-0
<v Ricky Horton>Trade. So a human does that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3848-0
<v Ricky Horton>If if you go into estimating,
I'll show you how that can be set up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3848-1
<v Ricky Horton>since you're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3873-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cost codes or or phase codes are used
kind of depending on how the material is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3873-1
<v Ricky Horton>used. It makes it more difficult,
but if you go to, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3873-2
<v Ricky Horton>go to company standards.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3880-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
go back up there and go to fabricator</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3880-1
<v Ricky Horton>information.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3898-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maintenance excavating, yeah,
and fabricating information about 5-6</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3898-1
<v Ricky Horton>there from the top and then cost periods
is at the bottom.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3909-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you go through and set up the cost for
all these different areas.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3943-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you got labor rates where you
could go in and you could assign a cost</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3943-1
<v Ricky Horton>per labor rate.
You can do it on estimate extras,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3943-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can do it on shapes.
So if if you set all that up then at the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3943-3
<v Ricky Horton>end of the estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3988-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know this with summary that's in
there it can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3988-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's an option in there break this
down by the cost code and it uses this to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3988-2
<v Ricky Horton>break it all down.
Now with your with it changing depending</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3988-3
<v Ricky Horton>on how you're using it,
you're going to have probably some manual</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/3988-4
<v Ricky Horton>intervention in order to make that work.
Yeah so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4021-0
<v Ricky Horton>Watch out so I get it to you.
I think about 75% of them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4021-1
<v Ricky Horton>They are a bolt is a bolt is a bolt that
is the same cost.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4021-2
<v Ricky Horton>A beam is always the same cost that that
makes it easy where it's just it's just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4061-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if it changes the wrong material,
that's going to be,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4061-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's going to be some main alliteration.
So yeah, that's for sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4061-2
<v Ricky Horton>And and the value of having it be one
line item per item that we can look at a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4061-3
<v Ricky Horton>historical data on it would be easier to
on a Costco basis as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4097-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas we don't,
I like you couldn't tell me how many,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4097-1
<v Ricky Horton>how many beans you bought in the last
year right now. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4097-2
<v Ricky Horton>you don't have Costco's tied to it.
I can just just send my inventory</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4097-3
<v Ricky Horton>information.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4142-0
<v Ricky Horton>Filtering for for what's been on order
and everything and I can go back to my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4142-1
<v Ricky Horton>purchase history and everything and look
at previous pricing for who I've ordered</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4142-2
<v Ricky Horton>based upon vendors and shapes and the
grades and so like if an estimator</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4142-3
<v Ricky Horton>reaches out to me and they say hey.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4167-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have time to get an estimate
pricing on this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4167-1
<v Ricky Horton>Can you tell me what the last date for
wide flange for 10 inch wide flanges?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4167-2
<v Ricky Horton>Just give me a range of sizes and I'll go
in here and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4171-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe this all out and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4180-0
<v Ricky Horton>Selecting group sizes and that's not
self-serve for those guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4214-0
<v Ricky Horton>They'd have to have you intervene.
They can't just self-serve them. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4214-1
<v Ricky Horton>they don't.
They don't know what they don't know what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4214-2
<v Ricky Horton>to do. So I wish I hear you so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4246-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
essentially going here and I'll sort by</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4246-1
<v Ricky Horton>date.
And so this one's a hard example because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4246-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's 2024 and I can tell you right now
I'm confidently pricing exchange from</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4246-3
<v Ricky Horton>them and even back then in 2024 we
weren't always put in the pricing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4250-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, getting sparse in here, so uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4254-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's fine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4255-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like 20 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4291-0
<v Ricky Horton>So these will be in my I can say 7166 to
$0.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4291-1
<v Ricky Horton>74 if you go in and that looks normal and
then that will give you at least a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4291-2
<v Ricky Horton>baseline of what we've paid in the last
few months and I'll take the average.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4320-0
<v Ricky Horton>How is $0.25 underweight in here?
25 cents underweight?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4320-1
<v Ricky Horton>This would have been before we were
putting full breakdowns of of materials</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4320-2
<v Ricky Horton>in there.
So if we look at an old purchase order.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4350-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some of these 22 jobs, this one,
that's bad. It's bad.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4350-1
<v Ricky Horton>We don't need new webcams for not going
away to the lead series. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4350-2
<v Ricky Horton>essentially a lot of these we wouldn't,
we wouldn't put a line in them every</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4350-3
<v Ricky Horton>single.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4386-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
every single price in here and cause</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4386-1
<v Ricky Horton>essentially our pricing was tracked in
the PO system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4386-2
<v Ricky Horton>So as long as we knew if we were per
quote, we put the quote price in,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4386-3
<v Ricky Horton>generate the PO,
attach our quote we got from the vendor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4386-4
<v Ricky Horton>and then this was more of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4412-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tracking lengths and quantities.
Now however,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4412-1
<v Ricky Horton>with our new projects and everything,
all of these are getting broken out for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4412-2
<v Ricky Horton>their specific pricing and cut weight or.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cut the price that we're doing with
Dave's promise and along with Davis</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4437-1
<v Ricky Horton>getting entered in there so that our
historical pricing has a lot more</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4437-2
<v Ricky Horton>accuracy, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4450-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that was early stages.
No reason we couldn't have been broke out,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4450-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we just didn't get that way.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4451-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm on and purchase for members finished
through side.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4452-0
<v Ricky Horton>See if there's anything else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4454-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which you can stop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4456-0

<v Ricky Horton>Anything on this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4479-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just thinking quickly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4502-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so they should be all jobs,
anything from 2022 to 2024,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4502-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything that's not in our inventory
allocated spot. So from here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4510-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can do this whole piece.
These are all projects,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4510-1
<v Ricky Horton>so that'll clear up the last bit.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4529-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to take a minute to think,
but I should clear up the bottom of this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4529-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, for items with the marks on hold,
continue with on hold items.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4530-0
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4541-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4541-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't need that we purchased.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4564-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are we positive? We won't hear anything.
Yeah, I followed up with Gary last week.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4564-1
<v Ricky Horton>He said. OK,

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4564-2
<v Ricky Horton>left to redo it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4570-0
<v Ricky Horton>I got all of this done in zero hours and
0 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4603-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, that's nice. Man,

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4603-1
<v Ricky Horton>morning. Right in the middle of that.

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4650-0

<v Ricky Horton>Is it think?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4658-0
<v Ricky Horton>Totally forgetting to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4664-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just going to wake up seeing these
shorter days.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4669-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you went from down to 318,000, yeah.</v>

<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4675-0
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't it the main authority?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4695-0
<v Ricky Horton>What we're also looking at is the we have
some extra budget on one of our projects</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4695-1
<v Ricky Horton>that we are going to use for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4698-0
<v Ricky Horton>Interested.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4700-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's your last name.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4708-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I was wondering too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4712-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4713-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4773-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I reached out to the progress Rep to
purchase the progress integration. Oh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4773-1
<v Ricky Horton>go with them so that we can get that
going because they know that we're we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4773-2
<v Ricky Horton>have a huge amount of off that runs from
the play machine that can be better</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4773-3
<v Ricky Horton>tracked with the inventory system that's
available in progress. OK and then having.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4808-0
<v Ricky Horton>We went link back and forth with that we
have. So yeah, so that's one thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4808-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then also purchasing the additional
modules which isn't really relevant to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4808-2
<v Ricky Horton>Tackler, but being able to comment like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4836-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, edge cut and everything.
That's going to certainly come to you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4836-1
<v Ricky Horton>So if you have trouble,
let me know how Chris would help me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4836-2
<v Ricky Horton>My guy Chris would help me,
so I forgot it and work on that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4836-3
<v Ricky Horton>integration.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4873-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll provide that.
That is what you got that long iteration</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4873-1
<v Ricky Horton>plan. That's what. Yeah, that's one.
Hopefully,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4873-2
<v Ricky Horton>hopefully we'll get a response this week
so I can get a purchase and then we can</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4873-3
<v Ricky Horton>have all the information that you can at
least get the process started.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4884-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's huge. So that that would be.
There's no reason why we shouldn't and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4928-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not necessarily that we haven't had the
value for it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4928-1
<v Ricky Horton>but if me and Alan are any of your
purchasing and working with your</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4928-2
<v Ricky Horton>programming anyways,
there's no reason why we shouldn't have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4928-3
<v Ricky Horton>that.
You have way better tracking of your</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4928-4
<v Ricky Horton>plate and your inventory for it, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4941-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
so that's the one area we struggle the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4941-1
<v Ricky Horton>most with when your links are really easy
to track and yeah, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4975-0
<v Ricky Horton>Putting when it gives us the you not
using this much square footage of your of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4975-1
<v Ricky Horton>your thing,
it's going in squares and rectangles and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4975-2
<v Ricky Horton>coming out with pitches, slopes,
cutouts and so yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4982-0
<v Ricky Horton>But OK, we'll see back out.
Now we're back.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4989-0
<v Ricky Horton>The stock's a lot better.
I order's a lot better.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/4991-0
<v Ricky Horton>See that was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5009-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's really see here. Uh,
I think a lot of the rest of it's just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5009-1
<v Ricky Horton>going through. So we finalizing.
There's a lot of this stuff from the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5009-2
<v Ricky Horton>bottom. It's all finalizing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5025-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is there a room that's back in for
those jobs we that you just got for that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5025-1
<v Ricky Horton>last smaller portion with the exception
of that one that I had to nullify because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5025-2
<v Ricky Horton>it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5028-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wouldn't let me, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5030-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5033-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5036-0
<v Ricky Horton>So very much.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5067-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it looks looks like there's anything</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5067-1
<v Ricky Horton>right.
So they're not very anything with remarks,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5067-2
<v Ricky Horton>inventory, Alex, our archive,
we spend it on it or there are all the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5067-3
<v Ricky Horton>time.
That's where he checks his confidence.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5116-0
<v Ricky Horton>Basis. Since we had such a mess in here,
anything that he verified person of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5116-1
<v Ricky Horton>tape measure had the numbers,
everything per AISC,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5116-2
<v Ricky Horton>he put his remarks against that.
So we kind of kept to them anytime</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5116-3
<v Ricky Horton>something comes off the side and it has a
heat number tracking TR something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5126-0
<v Ricky Horton>The location. Um,
the operator will assign that remark to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5126-1
<v Ricky Horton>it. So it looks like everything else is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5129-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see if it would, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5134-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's give us a support team.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5136-0
<v Ricky Horton>Interesting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5138-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5139-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5140-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5155-0
<v Ricky Horton>This piece I'm able to see this screen.
I don't even know what this is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5155-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's really weird.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5171-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was talking when I was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5172-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5174-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why don't you do it in the other material?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5184-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or the truck without the long holds.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5188-0
<v Ricky Horton>Apparently did some of the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5199-0
<v Ricky Horton>The potato. You know, that's so,
that's so, but longer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5199-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's delivering only a mutual freaking
baked potato.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5205-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's happening while we're on,
so while we're on, so we're closest.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5214-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right. That's great.
That's good for six. I just like so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5240-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I got it. I'll take care of it. No,
no, no. You guys,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5240-1
<v Ricky Horton>you stay focused on this.
Let me handle this. He's, he's,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5240-2
<v Ricky Horton>he's being at home with COVID and he's
going crazy. So he feels.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5258-0
<v Ricky Horton>Useless. I'll be able to. Can you?
I've been on the phone since 6.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5288-0
<v Ricky Horton>So for these purchase orders,
I went in and finalized them again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5288-1
<v Ricky Horton>Are these hanging out today? So yes,
I have the show finalize purchase orders</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5288-2
<v Ricky Horton>checkbox off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5295-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is it because there's bio items on this
that it won't?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5309-0
<v Ricky Horton>Think those 'cause technically,
these binaries aren't marked as received</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5309-1
<v Ricky Horton>at this point. Yeah, that would be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5311-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can believe it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5342-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, you don't have to block it by the way.
Oh, OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5342-1
<v Ricky Horton>just just so one of those will be
finalizes all you have to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5342-2
<v Ricky Horton>You can do the processes if you want,
but you don't have to or to to get out</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5342-3
<v Ricky Horton>any so that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5350-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll follow up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5365-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so do you want to see finalizing those</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5365-1
<v Ricky Horton>bad boys?
This one you can see how he's done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5365-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's other received divers,
so that's why I said OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5372-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess I can just push those through
and see them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5381-0
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause these are all old P OS,
so that's what I'll do at least.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5383-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5384-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5389-0
<v Ricky Horton>These are not watching, I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5393-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5395-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're about five lives on this evening.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5400-0
<v Ricky Horton>Take care of the workshop you've done it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5401-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't know. I so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5407-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see the checkbox. Oh,
finalize and receive. Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5408-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's really.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5428-0
<v Ricky Horton>Plus it gives you the option, hey,
do you want this to go into the inventory</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5428-1
<v Ricky Horton>or do you want to go to the inventory
history?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5428-2
<v Ricky Horton>That way you have to go to the inventory.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5441-0
<v Ricky Horton>Where do you guys run? Job costing here,
average costing, standard costing here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5446-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's none. Um, we do really both,
I think, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5446-1
<v Ricky Horton>We do job costing and standard costing,
yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5455-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's totally you run an accounting</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5455-1
<v Ricky Horton>system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5470-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
you said you'd use the wrong word right</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5470-1
<v Ricky Horton>there normally, but yeah, doesn't matter.
It just matters how you treat you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5472-0
<v Ricky Horton>Most of this job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5482-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll be honest, I'm not really.
I'm sure to follow that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5512-0
<v Ricky Horton>Job costing.
You just take the cost to buy silence</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5512-1
<v Ricky Horton>with jobs, standard costing.
I would cost less inventory and silence.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5512-2
<v Ricky Horton>No. So it my guess is the job then. Yeah,
jobs specifically for sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5530-0
<v Ricky Horton>I like job costing better.
We do this more accurate that way or it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5530-1
<v Ricky Horton>easier that's for job costing,
but it's harder like if you have a lot of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5530-2
<v Ricky Horton>standard products.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5544-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, get to share the cost,
like if the cost is in March and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5544-1
<v Ricky Horton>difference in September.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5573-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is the average costing,
then we don't need to do anything the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5573-1
<v Ricky Horton>same for us. So what happened?
The only time people looking for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5573-2
<v Ricky Horton>swapping and then I'm saying that for us
in the shop that we don't do like art.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5573-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's always different things that we're
working on. It's never like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5600-0
<v Ricky Horton>A standard.
The inventory in here is actual.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5600-1
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't do average LIFO,
LIFO doesn't do any of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5600-2
<v Ricky Horton>So unless they're doing something on the
back end somehow that this is actual cost</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5600-3
<v Ricky Horton>in European.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5603-0
<v Ricky Horton>Stops in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5615-0
<v Ricky Horton>What he just mentioned is what ends up
happening in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5621-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you guys don't product focus as much.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5623-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5633-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's probably process you can
automate with that little tool as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah, I've I've been using tools,
so yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's definitely something I want to dive
into.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I can make that process going into
level. Definitely eliminate a lot of this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-3
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
this a lot of these projects through 1179,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-4
<v Ricky Horton>this is the intel.
So a lot of this is about Unistra and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5681-5
<v Ricky Horton>then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5699-0
<v Ricky Horton>All these fittings, we got 10,
100 fittings, like, yeah, 40,000 of these.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5699-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's, it's interesting, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5721-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now, some of that stuff now,
people start using.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5721-1
<v Ricky Horton>If there's stuff you're not overseas,
some people start using subcontractors</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5721-2
<v Ricky Horton>for that because every single door and
yeah, it's just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5726-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's Mark, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5755-0
<v Ricky Horton>I get a question like that. All Chair,
you know, I mean, it's wide open.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5755-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just use the same case both the last.
We don't have requests, we don't have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5776-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, we have processed procedures,
but it's not there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5776-1
<v Ricky Horton>We've got the same request and say, hey,
she's his credit card number real quick.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5779-0
<v Ricky Horton>We never really want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5790-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've been in charge for about a month and
1/2 and it's like a list of things that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5790-1
<v Ricky Horton>need to be addressed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5822-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's a lot.
I'm just surprised your controller</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5822-1
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't just lose her mind.
She's too busy to get along with other</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5822-2
<v Ricky Horton>stuff.
But she's when I talked to her when I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5822-3
<v Ricky Horton>first started,
she said we're a bunch of high school</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5822-4
<v Ricky Horton>students pretending.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5830-0
<v Ricky Horton>Question one and I think that every, yeah,
you're right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5837-0
<v Ricky Horton>Early 2025 we're looking at.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5849-0
<v Ricky Horton>Documenting all our partner orders
through this and um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5857-0
<v Ricky Horton>That process went for about a month. Uh,
I mean that should be a good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5883-0
<v Ricky Horton>When I was in,
I used to track everything down to not</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5883-1
<v Ricky Horton>Washer. We were getting it.
I'm going to screen an appeal for it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5883-2
<v Ricky Horton>screen the location for it.
We were tracking, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5926-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here it's kind of got the money because
for a while there that was passed on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5926-1
<v Ricky Horton>The project engineers ordered anything
spec related to your project and we were</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5926-2
<v Ricky Horton>just ordering steel and then we kind of
got money again there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5926-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're now needing to order it because we
order things and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5940-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some PE do it, some PE don't.
And so then we started this process and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5940-1
<v Ricky Horton>didn't see it through so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5949-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm open to anything you can't see at
this point. I'd rather have about it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5996-0
<v Ricky Horton>I love them both. I mean,
that's what gets lost, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5996-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I love it in the year and I love them
receiving it just like they do a B or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5996-2
<v Ricky Horton>whatever that and you got tracking on it.
I agree with that wholeheartedly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/5996-3
<v Ricky Horton>First thing you get bosses.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6017-0
<v Ricky Horton>Where's my pulse? Yeah,
when I started doing that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6017-1
<v Ricky Horton>at least I had a five chance,
but I'm maybe you didn't want to put it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6017-2
<v Ricky Horton>in the issue. We start trying to partner.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
right now we receive stuff in two</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-1
<v Ricky Horton>locations. Yeah,
I'm trying to bring it all under one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to get those two trailers
pulled out of that dock warehouse and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-3
<v Ricky Horton>everything goes to the warehouse and gets
broad.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-4
<v Ricky Horton>You can see puts everything on the
Smartsheet so we have at least some sort</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-5
<v Ricky Horton>of record and stuff.
He can move over and start steering that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6067-6
<v Ricky Horton>button.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6101-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, that's all. Hold on.
Are your bolts all inventory and then the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6101-1
<v Ricky Horton>one that's not due to return stock?
So you know what you have or you know we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6101-2
<v Ricky Horton>returned some stuff to stock,
but we're trying not to carry it if we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6101-3
<v Ricky Horton>got paid for the equipment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6143-0
<v Ricky Horton>For the items, but when there is,
I'd rather return it and pay a stocking</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6143-1
<v Ricky Horton>fee if possible, which is very right.
Don't want to carry the inventory because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6143-2
<v Ricky Horton>everything is so unique. Yeah,
and then common stuff it'll it'll keep on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6143-3
<v Ricky Horton>hand.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6178-0
<v Ricky Horton>But everything comes in and gets grouped
together by job,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6178-1
<v Ricky Horton>put on the tablet on the shelves and
noted the location.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6178-2
<v Ricky Horton>So instead of having to do the choice,
but so that's where job cost take works</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6178-3
<v Ricky Horton>because everything is about job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6199-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you were running inventory exhausting,
they could. Let's say you stock one inch.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6199-1
<v Ricky Horton>We think you're 25 hours. Oh yeah,
if you were to do inventory graph,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6199-2
<v Ricky Horton>then you would be, yeah,
we wouldn't want to have inventory graphs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6199-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's a big problem in the pain.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6201-0
<v Ricky Horton>This and that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6231-0
<v Ricky Horton>30 drums of waste black bean inventory on
paint and plums. Every time you do it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6231-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's say you did 4 fourth quarter with
100 tons.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6239-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just have enough of inventory.
You don't buy it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6239-1
<v Ricky Horton>You buy every time 10 truckloads.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6262-0
<v Ricky Horton>We stopped more stuff here to be to be
honest, and it's still at around planning.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6262-1
<v Ricky Horton>We should go through it.
I think I can see it plans to have to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6262-2
<v Ricky Horton>things like that,
but it reminds about myself.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6264-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, OK. Besides,
how many is the restaurant there?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6274-0
<v Ricky Horton>The long windows are man.
At least you guys don't have to manage.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6282-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's what we're gonna do.
That's what I'm doing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll take what he's doing now,
which is tracking it in Smartsheet. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-1
<v Ricky Horton>and and move him over to tech tech list.
So that way it's tracked.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-2
<v Ricky Horton>We'll have to do both.
I think 'cause so I have to check with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-3
<v Ricky Horton>someone on top. It's so stupid.
Probably you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's like that was my question,
like why you do Smartsheet?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6336-5
<v Ricky Horton>Aren't you receiving it in this type of?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6363-0
<v Ricky Horton>This they should receive against the and
show it that it's received and they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6363-1
<v Ricky Horton>not. They don't do that.
There's none of that, no.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6363-2
<v Ricky Horton>But somebody does. No, it's like,
I don't know how I I PO will stay open.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6363-3
<v Ricky Horton>PO will stay open if they.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6392-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pl. The Pl.
stays open until the invoice comes and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6392-1
<v Ricky Horton>then the invoice is approved through the
approval system and then it's done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6392-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine.
All everything in between normal</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6392-3
<v Ricky Horton>operations or books you would consider
one of those come on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6430-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's none.
And that's what I would like because then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6430-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can instead of, you know,
going to the system and see it, you can't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6430-2
<v Ricky Horton>I I'm used to knowing when things are
received from my system and knowing when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6430-3
<v Ricky Horton>invoices are paid. Those are separate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6471-0
<v Ricky Horton>Things. So you know, hey,
I got it in the system and hey,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6471-1
<v Ricky Horton>it was paid for in the system.
Those are separate statuses and that's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6471-2
<v Ricky Horton>one of the reasons I think that we really
want to put everything in this shop on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6471-3
<v Ricky Horton>tech because then we can send it through,
we can run it more traditional and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6471-4
<v Ricky Horton>sensitive.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6502-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have visibility on everything as it
moves. And right now, like I said,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6502-1
<v Ricky Horton>physically they receive some stuff at the
shipping office and then some stuff to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6502-2
<v Ricky Horton>the warehouse and physically we can't do
it because we have too much junk.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6536-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the yard. So now we have this jar.
I don't want to get these trailers that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6536-1
<v Ricky Horton>are in our warehouse stuff out,
start receiving and all the receipts go</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6536-2
<v Ricky Horton>through that by the warehouse and nothing
goes over to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6536-3
<v Ricky Horton>It goes on a physical rack out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6546-0
<v Ricky Horton>And anyone can just walk up and take
whatever they want,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6546-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we have a big problem with that too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6584-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think the one with the balls in Europe
has a decent production because that's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6584-1
<v Ricky Horton>the other side of it is it even
membership bolts.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6584-2
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of people would just they are in
the production withdraw order from there</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6584-3
<v Ricky Horton>and they all kind of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6590-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's, yeah,
that's where they they build the um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
and they should be supposed to be worth</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-1
<v Ricky Horton>protective.
So we see what the the POL is as it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-2
<v Ricky Horton>still ordered and that's the next step to
it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-3
<v Ricky Horton>You have like each process that we're
looking at,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-4
<v Ricky Horton>there's multiple broken pieces in it.
It's just broken all over.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6632-5
<v Ricky Horton>So we start with.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6649-0
<v Ricky Horton>Control. First of all,
it's not the ship and then next is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6649-1
<v Ricky Horton>getting shipping on them.
They know where to go to get it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6649-2
<v Ricky Horton>What's it's it's a possible kind of
vaccine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6650-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6652-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6681-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is a tedious promise.
I walk in the middle of the road, not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6681-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care. I gotta do what's right.
It's just this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6681-2
<v Ricky Horton>So when the field guys are missing
something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6729-0
<v Ricky Horton>What happens? Who? Who do they go to?
Omar first and then you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6729-1
<v Ricky Horton>But what they do is they the field guys
have POS like PM to the PES.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6729-2
<v Ricky Horton>They let Omar know they they actually go.
They're supposed to go and put it on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6729-3
<v Ricky Horton>Smartsheet. So now we have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6761-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's like a record of it.
Then he receives against against sort of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6761-1
<v Ricky Horton>the smart sheets,
tells them that it's there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6761-2
<v Ricky Horton>and then he builds pallets of all their
all of their parts and pieces and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6761-3
<v Ricky Horton>labels it and puts it on the rack and
then notates the location of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6787-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then on the Smartsheets.
And then when they need it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6787-1
<v Ricky Horton>they go to the warehouse and they ask
them to load it. If something's missing,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6787-2
<v Ricky Horton>then it's all overview.
They're generating deals on listed, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6831-0
<v Ricky Horton>What we did is we walked in the list,
people like myself and we walked into</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6831-1
<v Ricky Horton>these messes and the first thing we do is
we we're trying to clean everything up to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6831-2
<v Ricky Horton>make it manageable and then we start
focusing on how we're going to streamline</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6831-3
<v Ricky Horton>this moving forward.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6862-0
<v Ricky Horton>So those,
that's kind of the phase where we're at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6862-1
<v Ricky Horton>right now. If it was first the warehouse,
anyone could walk in there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6862-2
<v Ricky Horton>I saw it and then we gated it off and
secured it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6862-3
<v Ricky Horton>cleaned it up and labeled the the
locations.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6866-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6871-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a lot of work and it's costing the
last year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6895-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you make any progress on those job
summaries that you guys were working on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6895-1
<v Ricky Horton>yesterday?
Were you were doing the comparisons of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6895-2
<v Ricky Horton>multiple jobs? No,
I just got those two that we did.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6896-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6910-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now I didn't have the estimate for that,
but yeah, but it's partially still.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6923-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll have.
We have to go do some more, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6944-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which would be a good process if they get
a order with it. We find stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6944-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're several times, generally,
we're seven hours. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6944-2
<v Ricky Horton>if we want to look at the process,
if I want to look at how maybe this is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6944-3
<v Ricky Horton>approximately, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6964-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I can do this all day. When are we?
When's the cadence?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6984-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know when somebody came in to
come in for building side of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6984-1
<v Ricky Horton>Was there anybody that was going to be
available today for that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/6984-2
<v Ricky Horton>Are we ready for that? Well,
this process is very.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7018-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tedious.
It's tedious that it requires critiques,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7018-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I should do this all day.
I don't be doing well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7018-2
<v Ricky Horton>but certainly done associated with just
finalizing the POS.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7018-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we can go back into comparing jobs
estimates and pushing labor between the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7018-4
<v Ricky Horton>two of those.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7052-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just, you know,
correlate and where we need the new</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7052-1
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments or if we have a number of
coding personnel available.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7052-2
<v Ricky Horton>The second part of our agenda is a major
rebuild of the coding system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7052-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it would be pretty key to have one of
them with us.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know it gives Mo a heads up.
Why don't we go into the afternoon?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-1
<v Ricky Horton>Aren't they in AISC?
That's how we can call to find out where</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-2
<v Ricky Horton>it is. It's a little chaotic.
I think tomorrow we get the environmental</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-3
<v Ricky Horton>people on top of that.
I see Mo in the meetings,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-4
<v Ricky Horton>but the meeting isn't.
Nobody started the meeting,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7104-5
<v Ricky Horton>so they're probably just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7112-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think they're doing it on site and all
the people that are off site are not</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7112-1
<v Ricky Horton>joining because there's no meeting going.
Yeah, there's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7155-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we can go to doing estimating and pushing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7155-1
<v Ricky Horton>labor against some of our estimated award
and if you can complete the I actually,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7155-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know, I'm sure.
I mean what would that have a status on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7155-3
<v Ricky Horton>for the candidates before they actually
come in here, but we need to try to deter.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7155-4
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know the data.
We need to determine how.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7185-0
<v Ricky Horton>We want it and then say here's what,
here's my vision with what this looks</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7185-1
<v Ricky Horton>like and then or we need them for that,
that type of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7185-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't think we really need that for the
defining of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7185-3
<v Ricky Horton>Essentially we want to track the coding
side of things.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7222-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the same granular level that we are
with production, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7222-1
<v Ricky Horton>we have handling fit well cut all that
kind of stuff,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7222-2
<v Ricky Horton>but as a I don't know if necessarily need
handling,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7222-3
<v Ricky Horton>but prep and then prime intermediate code
and so on and so forth which is gonna</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7222-4
<v Ricky Horton>fail.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7255-0
<v Ricky Horton>To associating,
associating that into our coatings or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7255-1
<v Ricky Horton>into our fabrication routes that involve
coatings,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7255-2
<v Ricky Horton>creating some routes that are just
coatings only. Mm-hmm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7255-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that we have that and then also going
into the inspections.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7305-0
<v Ricky Horton>And creating the inspections and tying
those inspections to those rounding so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7305-1
<v Ricky Horton>that they have their markers cause
they're not going to have to take and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7305-2
<v Ricky Horton>stop and Cody's only job must be
associated with something cause most of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7305-3
<v Ricky Horton>them they're just going to be important
seeing that we're going to see a regular</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7305-4
<v Ricky Horton>production job that they're not ever
going to use a production inspection.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7353-0
<v Ricky Horton>But then you also want to do that
estimating as well, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7353-1
<v Ricky Horton>You want them going later to do the
estimate. Yeah, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7353-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we'll want them in estimates.
So we'll have to break down the all the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7353-3
<v Ricky Horton>different types of prep and hours and
calculations associated with the prep as</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7353-4
<v Ricky Horton>well as.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7391-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know how many coding systems
we're going to want to associate,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7391-1
<v Ricky Horton>whether it's just prepping proxy code.
That's where, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7391-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm talking to coatings. Yeah,
that's the that's the that's really the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7391-3
<v Ricky Horton>difficult part.
Breaking down with the press there are</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7391-4
<v Ricky Horton>still very excited.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7417-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll look at that,
but the different coding systems I feel</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7417-1
<v Ricky Horton>like we'll come up with maybe half a
dozen up front and then we might have to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7417-2
<v Ricky Horton>add it.
We'll go as we set it up like 80% in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7417-3
<v Ricky Horton>middle.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7454-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you can set up,
you can set up unique coding systems per</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7454-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimate. So in other words,
don't try to set up everything you might</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7454-2
<v Ricky Horton>ever possibly do,
and it pulls into every job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7504-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just pull just put set up what what the
then the worry is if there's no one right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7504-1
<v Ricky Horton>You set it up to the 8% of what you need
and then the rest of them just set it up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7504-2
<v Ricky Horton>on an estimate by estimate basis.
That's kind of what we're thinking along</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7504-3
<v Ricky Horton>the same lines.
We have like the steel spec parameter</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7504-4
<v Ricky Horton>which is standard the the carb.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7543-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be able to sink, maybe even when we do,
there might be a maybe one or two epoxies.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7543-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're starting out kind of small on that.
We'll let them decide. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7543-2
<v Ricky Horton>they have the history,
but they have legs for all the refractory</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7543-3
<v Ricky Horton>for all of that.
So if you're doing SB10 here, they know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7573-0
<v Ricky Horton>What is it? Hours per square foot?
They did not have that last time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7573-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's in the past. It's in there.
That's what you're going to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7573-2
<v Ricky Horton>I assume that's what I have for the
record. Yeah, it'll be by the 22,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7573-3
<v Ricky Horton>so if it goes through the wheel and gravy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7580-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have it has to be 6, 65 and 10.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7582-0
<v Ricky Horton>23.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7616-0
<v Ricky Horton>23656 that's what we have.
Like there's there's pressure wash,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7616-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's a brushed blast,
there's the pan blast.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7616-2
<v Ricky Horton>You know when you start net,
you use steel shot,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7616-3
<v Ricky Horton>a build greater and then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7646-0
<v Ricky Horton>But are these codes ready to go so we
could we could build them out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7646-1
<v Ricky Horton>SP2 and SP3 are the only ones to work out
in there at this moment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7646-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's a very vague.
It sounds like just in Excel we just need</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7646-3
<v Ricky Horton>a list of the codes that are.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7695-0
<v Ricky Horton>That we need so we can get everything in.
You can fill it out, but the numbers.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7695-1
<v Ricky Horton>So again that we have been tracking the
last few jobs,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7695-2
<v Ricky Horton>he's been tracking the actual like time
studies more or less appears where it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7695-3
<v Ricky Horton>at because before it was when everybody
said oh, we use a standard,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7695-4
<v Ricky Horton>we use a standard.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7727-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, where are we at?
We we use the standard on on a job and we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7727-1
<v Ricky Horton>we have a 28% margin and we finished with
a big 5% margin.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7727-2
<v Ricky Horton>We were a little lost in it, lost in.
There's the greatest yesterday we have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7766-0
<v Ricky Horton>House deal comes in, where do we,
where do we want to land on the estimates?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7766-1
<v Ricky Horton>They go in the middle,
they don't go worst case. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7766-2
<v Ricky Horton>that has to all be kind of laid out,
I think. What's the goal?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7766-3
<v Ricky Horton>Is the goal to set that up today during
the voting meeting or is it set it up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7766-4
<v Ricky Horton>before then and say?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7787-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we need the data,
get the structure set up and then you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7787-1
<v Ricky Horton>know he enters, we set the parameters.
Who's gonna be the master of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7787-2
<v Ricky Horton>structures?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7832-0
<v Ricky Horton>So would you do the structures in Excel
first to get by or are we just hiring</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7832-1
<v Ricky Horton>them in? Why not? Let's do it.
Make a little progress. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7832-2
<v Ricky Horton>we can get them in there and then if I
need to tweak the numbers after the fact,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7832-3
<v Ricky Horton>I already know where to go to do.
So you want to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7885-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't need him over here,
but I'd like to get him over here. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7885-1
<v Ricky Horton>we don't have to go right to second.
We can push through with the comparing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7885-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimates,
the actuals in terms of us or doing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7885-3
<v Ricky Horton>something for a department that's not
represented.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7885-4
<v Ricky Horton>I'd want somebody here so that their buy
in is there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7923-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the end it's going to be, you know,
we're telling them that we're using this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7923-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's left here to do cooperation in
front of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7923-2
<v Ricky Horton>Production is going to be the easy side.
I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7923-3
<v Ricky Horton>as far as the set up and again they're
going, it's going to be the,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7923-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to take a little bit more
massaging to make.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7960-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. So yeah,
but production is going to be easy from a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7960-1
<v Ricky Horton>setup. So today at the estimating stage,
I imagine Tecla gives you a total square</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7960-2
<v Ricky Horton>footage and you guys just throw dollars
per square foot at it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7992-0
<v Ricky Horton>You don't really break it down or
depending on the operation,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7992-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you know the system,
you know the system is 150 bucks a square,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7992-2
<v Ricky Horton>just using a number.
That's what the estimators are doing and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/7992-3
<v Ricky Horton>the estimators also being told to
estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8029-0
<v Ricky Horton>Individual or is the system going to
actually estimate the individual center?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8029-1
<v Ricky Horton>Work center time that she works with.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8029-2
<v Ricky Horton>the time and material time work with me.
The system will send you time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8029-3
<v Ricky Horton>It'll tell you the cost of payment,
the cost of the need. No, no,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8029-4
<v Ricky Horton>we'll eventually want to set up with like
I'm trying to understand the estimator.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8032-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually does today.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8064-0
<v Ricky Horton>Does he call Moe when Moe just gives him
the number? No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8064-1
<v Ricky Horton>they kind of they they do talk and they
they go over what the you know they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8064-2
<v Ricky Horton>looking at size of the pieces,
what the requirements are,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8064-3
<v Ricky Horton>what the painting system is and then they
put the plan together and say OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8064-4
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna run it through.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8109-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pressure wash and then top coat.
And then there's a whole discussion on on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8109-1
<v Ricky Horton>how to shop.
I think what you're saying is when you do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8109-2
<v Ricky Horton>handrail,
the factors are going to be in for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8109-3
<v Ricky Horton>handrail. When you do W8,
it's in for W8 when you do it for W12.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8119-0
<v Ricky Horton>All those factors will be in there for W
12, W 44.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8119-1
<v Ricky Horton>All those factors will be in there for W
44.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8147-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes. So,
but it's really what we need to do is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8147-1
<v Ricky Horton>just keep it on a simple level,
just for the footage. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8147-2
<v Ricky Horton>it is not simple technical calculates
this work and then it does this side and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8147-3
<v Ricky Horton>then it's so, yeah,
and it does a bunch of waves too,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8147-4
<v Ricky Horton>the real problem.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8194-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's super simple in terms of it's the
handling. It's the it's the big issue.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8194-1
<v Ricky Horton>Fair enough.
Handling is the biggest problem in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8194-2
<v Ricky Horton>codings because you have to flip it,
you have to,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8194-3
<v Ricky Horton>you have to plus dwell time too.
Dwell time is a big deal in codings. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8194-4
<v Ricky Horton>cuz you sit there inactive,
their whole area is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8219-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is inactive. So we try to schedule.
It's stuff has to sit. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8219-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's right now it's scheduled in batches.
It's just batches, chunks. It's not like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8219-2
<v Ricky Horton>so you you have to do all the time is
huge.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8252-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's my biggest pet peeve out there is
that. Is there a stupid question,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8252-1
<v Ricky Horton>but is there a flow sheet of the whole
process? Has somebody built that out? OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8252-2
<v Ricky Horton>all right. So I think, I mean,
I'm used to just you step by step to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8252-3
<v Ricky Horton>write the process because it's like when
you when you write it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8297-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just basic because and then when you
get into it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8297-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's way more complicated than that. It's,
you know, depending on how, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8297-2
<v Ricky Horton>to get off the truck and stage it and
then move it to this stage and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8297-3
<v Ricky Horton>pressure to watch it and then all that
gets to be other.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8335-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know, but it's like, it's like,
it's like this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8335-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's five or six little blocks and that's
it. But then when you get down into it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8335-2
<v Ricky Horton>you look at,
there's all these factors and if it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8335-3
<v Ricky Horton>huge, we're gonna go, you know,
this route, if it's small,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8335-4
<v Ricky Horton>we're gonna do this route, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8362-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not just one,
there's one general one,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8362-1
<v Ricky Horton>but then there needs to be a flow chart
for all the different five or six</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8362-2
<v Ricky Horton>different scenarios like each one, 8%.
That's how it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8392-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's the most basic process we have and
they it is it's just overcomplicated at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8392-1
<v Ricky Horton>the same time.
I think I until you have all your process</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8392-2
<v Ricky Horton>flows there this one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8397-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because he and I don't know anything.
We know what we've done in other places.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8413-0
<v Ricky Horton>I like a gallon.
I think they they they both high parts</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8413-1
<v Ricky Horton>are very big parts,
but they still charge the same price per</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8413-2
<v Ricky Horton>pound to pay for once they have two or
three different prices based on their</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8413-3
<v Ricky Horton>size.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8451-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that kind of what you guys are going
to end up with?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8451-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we want to get to is the
first holidays is nuances. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8451-2
<v Ricky Horton>but focus on the 80%,
leave the nuances for the specials.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8451-3
<v Ricky Horton>And I agree,
lately everything's been a nuances.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8456-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, like 100%. I mean,
I don't think you get soup pretty easily.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8476-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we'll wait for that stuff.
I agree that ours are seem vastly</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8476-1
<v Ricky Horton>different than what the actual say that
the actuals are questionable anyway,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8476-2
<v Ricky Horton>but the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8477-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8513-0
<v Ricky Horton>What comes out of this in the back?
So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8513-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mean the bits that it it also depends
on the estimator too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8513-2
<v Ricky Horton>And that's one where I feel like we need
to all get on the same page is like most</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8513-3
<v Ricky Horton>of my estimates with the exception of
like me going and estimate extras and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8513-4
<v Ricky Horton>adding.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8549-0
<v Ricky Horton>Manual time for just heating a plate
because it's the cold season and we're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8549-1
<v Ricky Horton>welding the plates together and we need
to make sure that we're maintaining that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8549-2
<v Ricky Horton>or adding additional time for breaking
plate. We have a plan plate in there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8549-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it just goes like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8581-0
<v Ricky Horton>.44 hour per part to it. Um,
if it's more complex and multiple breaks,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8581-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah,
I'll increase that and increase the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8581-2
<v Ricky Horton>quantity and breaks.
That doesn't exactly what we need to,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8581-3
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm always using labor codes and then
we're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8625-0
<v Ricky Horton>Bullets or if I need to include multiple
passes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8625-1
<v Ricky Horton>then I'll go down in the estimate
pictures and have those.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8625-2
<v Ricky Horton>So those should calculate out pretty
close to being able to transfer that to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8625-3
<v Ricky Horton>what production showing. Yeah,
so most of mine are a lot of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8625-4
<v Ricky Horton>estimators they'll.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8640-0
<v Ricky Horton>Use the labor code sometimes.
Sometimes they won't use the labor code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8640-1
<v Ricky Horton>Sometimes they'll diet feel it,
and that's where we need to get.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8683-0
<v Ricky Horton>All of us estimators on the same page.
Yeah, but I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8683-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's say if you feel like you're doing a
correct,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8683-2
<v Ricky Horton>we need to hold a couple of your jobs and
look at them and say guys and then you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8683-3
<v Ricky Horton>gonna pull.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8719-0
<v Ricky Horton>Around the estimators for R3,
the name I've heard,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8719-1
<v Ricky Horton>we pulled three of theirs and say, hey,
this is what we expect and then let's see</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8719-2
<v Ricky Horton>how, you know,
see how they come out and see how.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8722-0
<v Ricky Horton>Data is captured.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8728-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll I I'll just set yourself open.
I don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8749-0
<v Ricky Horton>For us, the the, the,
the hours that are coming back from the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8749-1
<v Ricky Horton>shop are too perfect. Yeah, that's right.
They are. Would you be OK yesterday?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8749-2
<v Ricky Horton>Absolutely.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8784-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure. Yeah.
So we're monitoring that and Mo will be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8784-1
<v Ricky Horton>here.
He's a Mo is a an engineer by school and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8784-2
<v Ricky Horton>he is numbers oriented.
So he's very into this and likes to know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8784-3
<v Ricky Horton>where he's at. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8799-0
<v Ricky Horton>So he'll he'll be here at 10,
which is 30 minutes and I want him to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8799-1
<v Ricky Horton>kind of give a rundown too and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8844-0
<v Ricky Horton>He's a little rough around the head,
just to let you know. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8844-1
<v Ricky Horton>he doesn't think he speaks his mind,
so he's he's a really good guy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8844-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think we can see the honest information
about this. The main thing is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8844-3
<v Ricky Horton>is how the big question here is how we're
going to run Cody's own jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8851-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's really the thing that we're kind
of after, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8887-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which even then when we go in here
estimate wise we have mag epoxy standard</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8887-1
<v Ricky Horton>prime broke out in here for paint systems
and their standard is always going to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8887-2
<v Ricky Horton>apply the standard shop prime if you
select paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8932-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we have clean systems one
through 10 in here. However,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8932-1
<v Ricky Horton>these do not have much broke up.
I think SP2, SP3 actually have anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8932-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.
So if if you do it like that or do SP3,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8932-3
<v Ricky Horton>it should apply the the profile.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8958-0
<v Ricky Horton>In other words,
you don't need to do a clean system if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8958-1
<v Ricky Horton>you just have one if it's just SB,
but if I need to do SB, SB, six numbers,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8958-2
<v Ricky Horton>now the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8997-0
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so we have a lot of time we've got here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8997-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just fine tuning it because this is
kind of the level I don't know what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8997-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're looking for for the next part and
some of these are most of these they go</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8997-3
<v Ricky Horton>down.
I think the last time you set up the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/8997-4
<v Ricky Horton>metric was the last.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9024-0
<v Ricky Horton>The last breakdown that I got from
buildings and what I use for all the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9024-1
<v Ricky Horton>clean cranes down since every hundreds
would be 100 square foot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9024-2
<v Ricky Horton>They get one man an hour for prep,
one man an hour for private and then the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9024-3
<v Ricky Horton>paint breakdown is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9049-0
<v Ricky Horton>120 square foot hits me to get on.
So that breakdown is all pretty accurate,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9049-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's missing stuff.
So these are the prepaid systems are the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9049-2
<v Ricky Horton>only ones you guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9086-0
<v Ricky Horton>The only ones that are in the system, yes.
These are the only ones we're estimating.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9086-1
<v Ricky Horton>Cone is not a good example in my opinion.
I think I'm gonna speak for a while and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9086-2
<v Ricky Horton>say that's yeah, it'll have a different.
But while it's here we we.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9114-0
<v Ricky Horton>We should probably go through some
different scenarios and I'll start</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9114-1
<v Ricky Horton>building out like you have there.
I'll start building out the other</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9114-2
<v Ricky Horton>workflow on this.
It's quite a way go to the maintenance</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9114-3
<v Ricky Horton>and escalating the paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9115-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9117-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9119-0
<v Ricky Horton>This this factor A.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9133-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good. What about in this one of these? OK,
how many difference is the that's more</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9133-1
<v Ricky Horton>genius though?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9162-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, OK,
and this one I'm pretty sure you too,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9162-1
<v Ricky Horton>the labor multiplier because it's getting
that graph.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9162-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's getting an intermediate code and
code. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9162-3
<v Ricky Horton>so it's gonna double layer on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9170-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really for backup boxing you guys really
only put down 2 mils per code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9205-0
<v Ricky Horton>It depends because a lot of our customers
will have specifics and that's where this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9205-1
<v Ricky Horton>needs to be defined further.
Some of them are 9, some of them are 15.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9205-2
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, it's really,
that's really what you're saying is that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9205-3
<v Ricky Horton>these numbers are dotted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9246-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, these are not, these are not true.
No, I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9246-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you look at the spec sheet for macro
proxy, you can put down more than that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9246-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, almost definitely.
So and that's where this was kind of last</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9246-3
<v Ricky Horton>time you're looking at it.
There was nothing in here and we had no</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9246-4
<v Ricky Horton>coding.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9282-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I just,
we just put some information in here so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9282-1
<v Ricky Horton>that we can tweak it.
We know what it would look like and and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9282-2
<v Ricky Horton>then we could go back with them.
Like I said,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9282-3
<v Ricky Horton>actually 100 square foot per gallon on
this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9282-4
<v Ricky Horton>What's our thickness nodes we need to do?
Is labor multiplier accurate?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9303-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cost per gallon,
obviously that's going to fluctuate,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9303-1
<v Ricky Horton>but can we get an average in here? I mean,
do you guys use product additions? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9303-2
<v Ricky Horton>because all that's on. Yeah,
for the most part it should be able to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9303-3
<v Ricky Horton>get close.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9359-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, the right data sheets are. I mean,
that's that's the Bible, right? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9359-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's the cut and dry facts.
So the problem is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9359-2
<v Ricky Horton>is I've gone off the cut and dry facts
and then I'll submit an estimate for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9359-3
<v Ricky Horton>these and they say this is nowhere near
enough.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9359-4
<v Ricky Horton>What the hell are we talking about?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9398-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then I'll tweak my numbers to double
or triple and I'll be like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9398-1
<v Ricky Horton>if the numbers say that this shouldn't
work, like, well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9398-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's not what it is for us. So, OK,
so I've fought those battles in the past</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9398-3
<v Ricky Horton>and whether I bring in Chairman Williams,
Tonemic.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9400-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whoever.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9415-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know those that data is,
that's how that paint is supposed to be,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9415-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9427-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
we've had to go to the even in power</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9427-1
<v Ricky Horton>coding, like, you know,
a lot of power code is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9444-0
<v Ricky Horton>I want to go there, but you know,
Intel's a,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9444-1
<v Ricky Horton>you got to do it for the data sheets.
Yeah, I'm talking about the coverage.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9482-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, all of it. I in my mind,
product data sheets tell you how to apply</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9482-1
<v Ricky Horton>codings. And what I'm hearing is,
is what actually is being done is not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9482-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're saying the product data sheets
are ********.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9482-3
<v Ricky Horton>Some of the products data sheets are
********.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9482-4
<v Ricky Horton>Is it the the product data sheet?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9517-0
<v Ricky Horton>Takes in the factors in the transfer
efficiency.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9517-1
<v Ricky Horton>Also whatever your whatever your surface
prep is, it's not always perfect.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9517-2
<v Ricky Horton>So what what they do in order to cover
themselves is they take what the the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9517-3
<v Ricky Horton>coverage should be and they they they
change it. It's kind of like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9546-0
<v Ricky Horton>How we're changing,
handling to match our shop is changing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9546-1
<v Ricky Horton>the coverage based on actual versus
damage.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9546-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's something that published as the
calculator.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9546-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if it's a big calculator.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9559-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unless you put those things in,
you got to be taking, yeah, they have,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9559-1
<v Ricky Horton>they have a lot of those tools.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9593-0
<v Ricky Horton>But again,
when you're hand applying paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9593-1
<v Ricky Horton>we don't have a paint booth.
We're paying outside.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9593-2
<v Ricky Horton>They're playing with transfer efficiency.
They're high here. I don't buy it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9593-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's super hard to measure in here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9628-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because again,
you're you're going to measure what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9628-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to measure and check on
actuals and decide if it's worth</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9628-2
<v Ricky Horton>improving, right?
And that's kind of what they what they do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9628-3
<v Ricky Horton>But the way they calculate their transfer
efficiency from what I understand is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9628-4
<v Ricky Horton>based on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9633-0
<v Ricky Horton>The the DFTS of the of the codings which.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9690-0
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't always accurate because you you
have a huge surface and you're checking,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9690-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're doing a check in so many spots and
you're saying, OK, everything,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9690-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to assume everything has this
average of thickness.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9690-3
<v Ricky Horton>Well now you just kind of everything's
kind of getting skewed at that point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9690-4
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's not super accurate on that when
you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9715-0
<v Ricky Horton>When I think transfer efficiency,
I want to be as accurate as possible on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9715-1
<v Ricky Horton>that number because I assume somebody
measures paint thickness. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9715-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's part of the quality check.
So I assume you sample a reasonable</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9715-3
<v Ricky Horton>surface area.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9747-0
<v Ricky Horton>Depends. Yeah,
like the pockets of beans typically is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9747-1
<v Ricky Horton>areas that are either over sprayed or
under sprayed, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9747-2
<v Ricky Horton>We have this job coming through the I
don't know how you forget,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9747-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it was for the fire.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9772-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's like freaking impossible,
but it's almost impossible to achieve.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9772-1
<v Ricky Horton>But if you have anything off of it,
share everything off of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9772-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's not touch up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9789-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like how and you know you can't
control anything unless you can measure</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9789-1
<v Ricky Horton>it.
It's like you can and then how how</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9789-2
<v Ricky Horton>accurate are we going to measure
something you know it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9794-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've always been able to view it. Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9823-0
<v Ricky Horton>No painting things that are a lot smaller
by the two weight differences and pain</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9823-1
<v Ricky Horton>replied. So I got pain pain.
Same nightmare that you guys had on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9823-2
<v Ricky Horton>Miami Ducks. I was in the middle of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9847-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have a station set up for? No.
We need to add some stations in there and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9847-1
<v Ricky Horton>then add those into our route.
Can we go in the station in the route set</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9847-2
<v Ricky Horton>up? Yeah, yeah, this is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9848-0
<v Ricky Horton>Power.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9864-0
<v Ricky Horton>A little bit of a loading stage here,
so ever since I switched to .</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9864-1
<v Ricky Horton>25 I it's been.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9885-0
<v Ricky Horton>But a few moments where if I put anything
already now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9885-1
<v Ricky Horton>it'll say that was not responding. Uh,
I'm gonna message IT speaks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9885-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can't restart the server.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9923-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if this is because we're
running SQL 2019.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9923-1
<v Ricky Horton>Every every bit of documentation I look
up online recognizes this to be on a 2025</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9923-2
<v Ricky Horton>Windows OS base for server,
but the what I said that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9947-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our SQL should be able to run this just
fine. What SQL version does it do that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9947-1
<v Ricky Horton>It is the It's not a platform version,
isn't it? No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9982-0
<v Ricky Horton>We've worked on the getting in there,
but wants to do anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9982-1
<v Ricky Horton>But she said we were on the to be
originally on 8.43, something like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/9982-2
<v Ricky Horton>I know it was at 8.4.
I think you know more on the 8.1.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10016-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's kind of the latest for the 2019.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10016-1
<v Ricky Horton>there was an issue with starting 2025
that if you upgraded to 2025 but then you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10016-2
<v Ricky Horton>were on like 5.
0 version of SQL then it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10019-0
<v Ricky Horton>But things could happen.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10061-0
<v Ricky Horton>And and it was weird. Sometimes,
sometimes you saw it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10061-1
<v Ricky Horton>saw a result that some people didn't see,
but like I went, I went once,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10061-2
<v Ricky Horton>like they get to, they get to the board.
Oh yeah, but the next got good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10061-3
<v Ricky Horton>I made that sense as far as what it was
doing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10100-0
<v Ricky Horton>Some of the issues we've been having
because you have issues where you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10100-1
<v Ricky Horton>couldn't import,
you couldn't add a a production job,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10100-2
<v Ricky Horton>couldn't project management job,
but I can do everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10100-3
<v Ricky Horton>I I still can't send it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10130-0
<v Ricky Horton>Transmittal, you know? Yeah,
I have to pull the transmittal from Sento</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10130-1
<v Ricky Horton>and save it.
But then it's funny when you pull it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10130-2
<v Ricky Horton>it doesn't put it into the folders. Yeah,
it just pulls all of the files basically</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10130-3
<v Ricky Horton>and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10152-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's Office 360.
You don't have an existing app,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10152-1
<v Ricky Horton>which one the actual e-mail app,
because if it's if it's a browser.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10154-0
<v Ricky Horton>I use the app.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10177-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because yeah,
I I use the app that lets me log into the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10177-1
<v Ricky Horton>app. You get the works signal. Yeah,
but if I if I use the online one,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10177-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I'm on the app.
I'm not on the browser anymore.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10184-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I just know since I have to do what I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10184-1
<v Ricky Horton>started, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10186-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10207-0
<v Ricky Horton>What was all that we're just shooting the
ship here? Uh, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10207-1
<v Ricky Horton>kind of at this point we're waiting to to
to kick back in and first and then it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10207-2
<v Ricky Horton>coming again,
talking long and then you're not going to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10207-3
<v Ricky Horton>actually bid.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10211-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why are we trying to push the line?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10262-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to push it into power for
tracking purposes. Yeah, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10262-1
<v Ricky Horton>tracking purposes, cut links and layer.
I ran quite a few through here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10262-2
<v Ricky Horton>just running them as broad and then going
into my purchase of both sizes and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10262-3
<v Ricky Horton>switching.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10292-0
<v Ricky Horton>My approach is purchasable relates to 500,
one thousand 1500 and 2000 linear feet</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10292-1
<v Ricky Horton>and then this is for cut lengths of wires.
So I think that's a portion of what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10292-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're trying to do is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10332-0
<v Ricky Horton>To be able to have an inventory system
for spools of wire and then cut links so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10332-1
<v Ricky Horton>the technicians have cut links for their
wire with running through conduit and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10332-2
<v Ricky Horton>whatnot.
And then I'm assuming also in the same</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10332-3
<v Ricky Horton>sense of tracking links, conduit,
the receiving cable trigger.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10379-0
<v Ricky Horton>And buyout items and whatnot.
So they want to have a separate entity so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10379-1
<v Ricky Horton>that that inventory is not in our steel
inventory and or one connect and they</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10379-2
<v Ricky Horton>will then use that too.
So they can use between triple connect,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10379-3
<v Ricky Horton>they can load up their own models and
everything that area of the system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10399-0
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't necessarily where they don't want
the money they can use.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10399-1
<v Ricky Horton>They can use that without messing with
the and that we have,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10399-2
<v Ricky Horton>but keeping their production jobs
separate and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10428-0
<v Ricky Horton>Inventory's found that they can sleep,
not sleeping.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10428-1
<v Ricky Horton>So and then they can get other different
files.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10428-2
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody can answer that question
because it's it's we're not. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10428-3
<v Ricky Horton>I see the logic. Yeah, that's no,
they that's their logic behind it, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10462-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, we don't.
They just tell us what to do. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10462-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's that's what we think.
That's what I didn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10462-2
<v Ricky Horton>They they made requests and it's not,
you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10462-3
<v Ricky Horton>I I like to know the why is and it's more
like, hey, you can do this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10462-4
<v Ricky Horton>We want to see this happen,
see what what this can do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10495-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
and Jerry's granted is that there isn't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10495-1
<v Ricky Horton>necessarily a system that does that and
that does worse specific.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10495-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then we can add our own shapes and
sizes in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10495-3
<v Ricky Horton>We just need to make sure that we define
them so that the system's looking at it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10495-4
<v Ricky Horton>correctly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10524-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tracking the linear lengths and adding
sizes in there that are tracked piece by</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10524-1
<v Ricky Horton>piece,
not necessarily by size and stuff they</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10524-2
<v Ricky Horton>did needed.
They were requested utility to fill out a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10524-3
<v Ricky Horton>project that had.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10566-0
<v Ricky Horton>So many different boxes and features with
wire.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10566-1
<v Ricky Horton>They're trying to automate the process so
that they can import, combine,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10566-2
<v Ricky Horton>throw that into the requisition,
have the big picture of this is the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10566-3
<v Ricky Horton>quantities of these items they need and
then have the inventory tracking with us.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10591-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because at least my understanding with
what Jarrod's goal was with that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10591-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't know,
I don't necessarily think they're trying</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10591-2
<v Ricky Horton>to do an estimate estimated side of it
more with a a combined inventory tracking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10596-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10604-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is, uh, Tom works. Tom works. Yeah,
you know, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10628-0
<v Ricky Horton>I hope I get a response from IT quickly
and the server gets restarted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10628-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was hoping maybe we're going to run
into this. So what are your goals?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10631-0
<v Ricky Horton>Coming to stuff in Takla.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10632-0
<v Ricky Horton>Great.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10667-0
<v Ricky Horton>I want to see what I can do personally.
I don't know what I know what you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10667-1
<v Ricky Horton>trying to get at,
but at the same time it hasn't been</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10667-2
<v Ricky Horton>explained what we can put in there and
what we can expect out of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10704-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, you can. I mean,
just like the general literally,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10704-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can't estimate it in there. So it'll,
it'll, you apply things just to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10704-2
<v Ricky Horton>It'll tell you how much time it takes,
how much film cleaning and all that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10736-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we're going to do that on this side
and then on the production side,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10736-1
<v Ricky Horton>then you can also then be tracking if you
want has it been,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10736-2
<v Ricky Horton>I mean really whatever you can you want
hasn't been blasted, hasn't been cleaned,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10736-3
<v Ricky Horton>hasn't been.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10764-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can do multiple codes if you want to
track multiple codes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10764-1
<v Ricky Horton>If you want or you can just say how do
you spill it or if you're not,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10764-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know so that you know exactly which
pieces are done and which pieces are.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10764-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that way you'll have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10797-0
<v Ricky Horton>The real function on this on this project,
you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10797-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you can try it to really whatever
level you want to try to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10797-2
<v Ricky Horton>So as far as this thing,
does it already have preset book values</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10797-3
<v Ricky Horton>or is that something you have to do again?
It does. It does, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10834-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, I would not.
I wouldn't want to make it any longer</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10834-1
<v Ricky Horton>that way.
You want me to put in whatever your brand</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10834-2
<v Ricky Horton>so that everybody's doing the same thing,
right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10834-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it doesn't matter if you do at that
point, you do the same the same thing. So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10834-4
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
it's probably customizable for that, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10884-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it can be done.
The estimate is very customizable.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10884-1
<v Ricky Horton>So again in in this case then you can
have everything in one estimate if you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10884-2
<v Ricky Horton>want to get the original estimate just
for the steel and then here's the paint</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10884-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimate on top of it.
It's all in one system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10884-4
<v Ricky Horton>You want to do the same thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10919-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what's the effort?
If you receive 10 truckloads of customer</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10919-1
<v Ricky Horton>issued material, you've never modeled it.
You just got 10 truckloads of fabricated</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10919-2
<v Ricky Horton>steel. And what's the that's the effort?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10946-0
<v Ricky Horton>To get that into the system, well,
if it's saying it's going for a little</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10946-1
<v Ricky Horton>time,
hopefully there's certainly a file that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10946-2
<v Ricky Horton>might be Michigan board and then and then
all that material gets in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10946-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that has to give it depends, I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10989-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's,
I mean that's one of the concerns that I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10989-1
<v Ricky Horton>had is how much time to take put that
stuff in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10989-2
<v Ricky Horton>I mean some stuff is custom fabricated
like that and is our job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10989-3
<v Ricky Horton>They're fabricating the pipe supports on
set and they give me a general.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10989-4
<v Ricky Horton>This is how it looks and it can be from
24 to 48 to that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/10994-0
<v Ricky Horton>So your and this this would be a.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11034-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cody's only project, right?
What you're saying?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11034-1
<v Ricky Horton>How much of that is it like from let's
say a structural like thing versus like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11034-2
<v Ricky Horton>to say or whatever.
Who all this is coming from is the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11034-3
<v Ricky Horton>question I got.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11069-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the field fabricated,
this is probably the only specific job</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11069-1
<v Ricky Horton>that comes to mind.
But at the same time I had a job recently</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11069-2
<v Ricky Horton>with WW and they supplied the kiss files,
but they were all screwed up. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11069-3
<v Ricky Horton>they had sizes and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11084-0
<v Ricky Horton>Metric in the mix in the interior or one
way or the other, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11084-1
<v Ricky Horton>What do you like a square feet steel?
Yeah, I had been doing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11084-2
<v Ricky Horton>I know it wasn't done. Yeah, it was. Well,
let's put it this way.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11123-0
<v Ricky Horton>It those guys ought to be able to produce
a file, right? That actually works.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11123-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then it's just been important.
So if it they ought to be able to produce</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11123-2
<v Ricky Horton>that now,
even if they need to you to make sale,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11123-3
<v Ricky Horton>heck, we can important sale, right?
And then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11163-0
<v Ricky Horton>So even that's all I've got.
You get all these documents sheet up on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11163-1
<v Ricky Horton>that one and you get everything to
imperial over everybody that we're set up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11163-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say it was wrong. What'd you do?
You went out there manually to the take</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11163-3
<v Ricky Horton>off and you received the trucks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11164-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11199-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's not. It wasn't that.
We just got a payment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11199-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's give him a safe number, right?
You just said that's 10,000 square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11199-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well, they gave you a like, this is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11226-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty close to the square footage out of
their program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11226-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's like this is this is pretty close
and and then we just added added on top</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11226-2
<v Ricky Horton>of that the debate over disagreement.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11264-0
<v Ricky Horton>I got the talking and somebody said that
bonding was X and you said no, it's not X,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11264-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's Y.
I remember a conversation in your office</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11264-2
<v Ricky Horton>when Jeff was introducing me to you and
you guys were talking about the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11264-3
<v Ricky Horton>discrepancies.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11299-0
<v Ricky Horton>Quantities and nobody really cared if the
unit price bid once she does figure the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11299-1
<v Ricky Horton>quantities. Was that that job? No,
that was that was lump sum.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11299-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's not necessarily the business unit
price contract.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11315-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it gives me a ballpark aggression of
you that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11315-1
<v Ricky Horton>but your biggest concern really is
getting it into the system out of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11354-0
<v Ricky Horton>I like the idea of more tracking and
value that ability to track through the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11354-1
<v Ricky Horton>process and account and everything,
but it's never been used.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11354-2
<v Ricky Horton>So the the files should not be a problem
for these guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11354-3
<v Ricky Horton>That should not be a problem.
If you get it again, then you notice.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11398-0
<v Ricky Horton>All the all the pieces I would want the
the overall process would be I would</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11398-1
<v Ricky Horton>important production control and get my
bill of materials and then I would if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11398-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's me I'm taking that I'm pushing it
over to a zero dollar PO so I can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11428-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can track the receiving of it as well.
I can track the receiving of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11428-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I know what I got here on site that
that that I that I can actually work on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11428-2
<v Ricky Horton>and then I'm going to track it all the
way through as well and do do the do the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11428-3
<v Ricky Horton>production tracking on so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11454-0
<v Ricky Horton>So then that would be the, you know,
process. So you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11454-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you give them a subcontractor POS on
picking the inventory,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11454-2
<v Ricky Horton>so they'll have the recipient.
Once the money is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11454-3
<v Ricky Horton>we get a phone call in the morning
potential for a large project.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11484-0
<v Ricky Horton>Steel is on the truck and he's gonna,
he's estimating to lower the phone at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11484-1
<v Ricky Horton>this point.
The stuff shows up when we start working</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11484-2
<v Ricky Horton>on it. You know,
it's we start to finish six hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11484-3
<v Ricky Horton>There's no fine.
It's not necessarily to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11517-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to try and catch what you
wanted to say? This is truck one,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11517-1
<v Ricky Horton>this is truck 2. How?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11550-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's what I want to get to.
Like how simple can we make it so he can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11550-1
<v Ricky Horton>That job was a huge money maker and we
don't want to have a delay from getting</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11550-2
<v Ricky Horton>started.
He wants to track it in the detail.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11550-3
<v Ricky Horton>We want to gather that data. You know,
that's another.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11579-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just the DOL, right? Just the DOL, right?
They didn't. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11579-1
<v Ricky Horton>they didn't give me drawings. I mean,
we can just go off on DOL.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11579-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it's gonna take, well, I just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11627-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is this fabricated? Yeah.
So they they didn't have his files</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11627-1
<v Ricky Horton>probably because I asked him to work with
and they send me a screenshot and it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11627-2
<v Ricky Horton>looked like they were using tech look.
Yeah, so that's how I estimated them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11627-3
<v Ricky Horton>Like you said, the whole thing,
the steel was on the ground and they</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11627-4
<v Ricky Horton>processed it since I was,
I'm a very stubborn.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11662-0
<v Ricky Horton>Idiots sometimes.
And I I was just very much be like I know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11662-1
<v Ricky Horton>nothing to be filed.
They can get it in about a few minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11662-2
<v Ricky Horton>So it it's not a problem for me to get it.
I I'll just rip a set of no as an answer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11662-3
<v Ricky Horton>You know I know that's that's easy to say
but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11699-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
most jobs I go to with something like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11699-1
<v Ricky Horton>this, they just don't ask. It's like,
well, they don't get,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11699-2
<v Ricky Horton>if you want to do the job, get it to me,
right? So it's very,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11699-3
<v Ricky Horton>especially for a user,
but it's it's a two-minute process, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11699-4
<v Ricky Horton>I can literally write through and screw
the same thing like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11727-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's kind of where we're at.
But if by some chance we can't get any of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11727-1
<v Ricky Horton>that, we want to understand the time,
the process and how simple can we break</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11727-2
<v Ricky Horton>it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11760-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like like Eric's saying with a truck load
or something like that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11760-1
<v Ricky Horton>just as a lack so we understand. Yeah,
definitely.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11760-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's it's very simple to get it in there.
It's very simple to get it in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11780-0
<v Ricky Horton>A a drawing number, a main mark,
a piece mark, quantity, shape, grade,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11780-1
<v Ricky Horton>size, length,
and that's the main style benefits.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11780-2
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11830-0
<v Ricky Horton>For all the pieces.
So is it faster to keystroke that into</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11830-1
<v Ricky Horton>Excel and import it or go straight into
power?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11830-2
<v Ricky Horton>I do it because in in Excel I put in the
W 14 and 23 which doesn't exist and Excel</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11830-3
<v Ricky Horton>will let me.
If I do that in here then it'll know that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11830-4
<v Ricky Horton>you got to put in the balance size.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11868-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I've to for me it would be easier to
still get here. I'm used to it right then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11868-1
<v Ricky Horton>But plus it has the it has the controls
to make sure I'm either going to get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11868-2
<v Ricky Horton>property as well. Yes Sir.
I'm personally an Excel guy,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11868-3
<v Ricky Horton>but I hear you because.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11895-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
I like Excel and push because I don't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11895-1
<v Ricky Horton>know the screen if it's a function.
Let's see, like I can put in a piece mark.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11895-2
<v Ricky Horton>Can you put one in correct? No.
Can we put one in to show them how to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11895-3
<v Ricky Horton>it? Yeah. Oh yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11898-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11929-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody's it sounds like it's a body.
How long does it take to get it done?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11929-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
and independent is it's going to be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11929-2
<v Ricky Horton>monitored longer going this way initially
anyway,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11929-3
<v Ricky Horton>just because there's going to be a new
process right now, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11943-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, if this was functioning,
we shouldn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11943-1
<v Ricky Horton>So annual entry is a part of what's the
December, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11944-0
<v Ricky Horton>Deepak.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not to be trivial stuff.
So if if you have a,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know this is PB and SP.
If you have a bee with a bunch of flag</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-2
<v Ricky Horton>plates,
you're just calling it a bee and skipping</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-3
<v Ricky Horton>all the flags for us.
It depends when I also try to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-4
<v Ricky Horton>Very exactly.
It's actually very footage of I think.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/11987-5
<v Ricky Horton>Then I need you guys to call it parties.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12038-0
<v Ricky Horton>If it's just made in tracking so that
they know what's going out and they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12038-1
<v Ricky Horton>not worried about accuracy of the weight
of the oils because they already have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12038-2
<v Ricky Horton>prebuilt the oils from an exterior entity,
I can run maintenance remarks all day and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12038-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then we can at least have the level
of tracking for the one of the assemblies</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12038-4
<v Ricky Horton>and that's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12071-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine,
but if it sounds like we use it for a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12071-1
<v Ricky Horton>footage number, we need accurate DOL,
so we need everything into my T and I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12071-2
<v Ricky Horton>don't give us to add everything's with
the exceptional hardware into that. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12071-3
<v Ricky Horton>I have a feeling when a job like this
comes in, price is not driving it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12084-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so you might be less inclined to be every</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12084-1
<v Ricky Horton>little flag type that you may not be
training that build something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12129-0
<v Ricky Horton>If I have a KISS file,
I could get to just a shut up. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12129-1
<v Ricky Horton>if I have a KISS file and we pre-build
these routes that that we need,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12129-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's the point.
So that's the three with the primer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12129-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to build whatever I have to be.
Depends on the size of the project. 50,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12129-4
<v Ricky Horton>000 square feet, 50,000 square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12160-0
<v Ricky Horton>Where it puts loads at least over 100
assemblies,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12160-1
<v Ricky Horton>depending on how big the assemblies are,
I can go the end of the route to all of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12160-2
<v Ricky Horton>it and then kiss in,
so in theory 1010 minutes at that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12190-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's important and the project
inclination and routes to it and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12190-1
<v Ricky Horton>just glance over and make sure you don't
miss anything out. That's how it works.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12190-2
<v Ricky Horton>10 minutes is like PSMC 5 three maybe
five.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12235-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you have to run. Yeah, yeah,
that's the one you got from rolling</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12235-1
<v Ricky Horton>plates, right? Yeah, yeah,
that's approach. That's that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12235-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's that 200 package that they were
talking about earlier this month.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12235-3
<v Ricky Horton>They got what we needed 69 times or
something like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12262-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, OK, yeah, I have that imported logs.
All of the what's what's the things,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12262-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think,
because they got two things that's on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12262-2
<v Ricky Horton>that ship.
I'm doing the part line only place.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12275-0
<v Ricky Horton>There was one where it was a good
presentation, guys. We um, well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12275-1
<v Ricky Horton>while they were coding it,
they had only sent it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12284-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wherever they were having COVID was
having issues,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12284-1
<v Ricky Horton>so we opened everything guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12294-0
<v Ricky Horton>What are you finishings would like you to
do? Do we need some finishings for that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12329-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a dose need to be cleaned up.
There's a couple of,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12329-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they're most of it's paint on paint
gallon. Yeah, that's red bread and butter.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12329-2
<v Ricky Horton>We don't have anything to find specific,
so and then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12355-0
<v Ricky Horton>Even before I had my permissions,
whatever any estimator,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12355-1
<v Ricky Horton>Joe Schmog imported,
but then 02 P 03 P Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12355-2
<v Ricky Horton>so whatever coding systems,
but there's a lot to clean up,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12355-3
<v Ricky Horton>'cause you got to do every job and clean
the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12368-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's terrible. Yeah,
this would be what our scope of work is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12368-1
<v Ricky Horton>14 since he had three.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12406-0
<v Ricky Horton>That looks like it's, but yeah,
that's things down a little bit. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12406-1
<v Ricky Horton>So this isn't this.
They came to us somewhere like, oh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12406-2
<v Ricky Horton>you should probably talk to the coders
because you know that they're all fine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12406-3
<v Ricky Horton>And this is one of the ones I want to do
have the quality issues or have the time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12433-0
<v Ricky Horton>We were told rolling like that.
They're taking up to the 4th,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12433-1
<v Ricky Horton>so we want to check that. So yeah,
which they mentioned in the meeting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12469-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the distance,
I can even apply cleaning those routes to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12469-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we need to find a job just for I think
they should be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12469-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think they should do it anybody that's
already in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12475-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, well,
they're going to be different packages,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12475-1
<v Ricky Horton>different jobs, different projects.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12521-0
<v Ricky Horton>I imagine you guys would be following the
CV roads in Manhattan. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12521-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm saying to bring the ship back from
Rolling Blaze is shipping. So they've got,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12521-2
<v Ricky Horton>they've got storage in our that's got 400
plus loads and they're also reaching out</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12521-3
<v Ricky Horton>to that was going to start shipping to us
directly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12542-0
<v Ricky Horton>I also want to know that store is 2 or
two weeks. I think it was five or six.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12542-1
<v Ricky Horton>All my deal was was in here.
So you subcontract back this four shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12544-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that what you're saying?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12576-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they got,
they got a contract from Shuff and the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12576-1
<v Ricky Horton>paint will do the paint and portion and
we have a contract with Grove of Plains</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12576-2
<v Ricky Horton>to paint for Shuff.
So we're a second tier something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12598-0
<v Ricky Horton>Separate Johnson. Yeah,
separate Johnson instead of you. Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12598-1
<v Ricky Horton>Otherwise, I'm not sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12631-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if it's something you're finding and
you've got and you're important. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12631-1
<v Ricky Horton>we'll get the files from that. All right.
I'm just worried about the current job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12631-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
It's going to be a hard time trying to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12631-3
<v Ricky Horton>keep this stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12644-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it was separate. Explain that.
What are you tracking that tracking that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12644-1
<v Ricky Horton>because we're basically doing the same
job as computer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12681-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so we have already a separate.
You guys have a separate bid number. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12681-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
They want everything sticker too. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12681-2
<v Ricky Horton>you guys are entertaining the new chef
stickers on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12686-0
<v Ricky Horton>So can you guys clear up like your lay
down areas on the start?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12707-0
<v Ricky Horton>They have a conversation now with me
because that's going to be kicked back</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12707-1
<v Ricky Horton>harder than the freaking you know, slow.
What kind of tracking tomorrow?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12709-0
<v Ricky Horton>I imagined.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12741-0
<v Ricky Horton>Breath. Whatever the system, yeah,
standard process of private and prime.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12741-1
<v Ricky Horton>If there's any other additional poster by
a track that as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12741-2
<v Ricky Horton>So pretty much from the initiative or
some sort.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12741-3
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to do like contact points or?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12745-0
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause if that's usually the last
standard composable.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12748-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so would it be?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12788-0
<v Ricky Horton>Prep prime. Are you doing checks in there?
Yep. Did he want checks?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12788-1
<v Ricky Horton>Did he want checks out? Yep,
because that's where I have to tie each</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12788-2
<v Ricky Horton>of those to an inspection.
So somebody to get that to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12823-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're gonna have to go on PM go and say
yes, this is through this checkpoint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12823-1
<v Ricky Horton>check by and complete and then that
update my status and you need a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12823-2
<v Ricky Horton>percentage. You want full visibility,
so it's not yet on CS full visibility.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12866-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now,
because on top of everything else decor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12866-1
<v Ricky Horton>that is the key for him is,
like I mentioned yesterday,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12866-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're running all of it.
No course direction.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12866-3
<v Ricky Horton>If he's got real-time updates,
he can make adjustments on the fly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12917-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's one of the key things for him.
He's he's a project,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12917-1
<v Ricky Horton>so that's what that's his perspective on.
For scheduling,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12917-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to need to know it, right?
Because you're going to need to know if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12917-3
<v Ricky Horton>you can move to the next step, you know,
next schedule. I think it works.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12917-4
<v Ricky Horton>What what is what at what points does the
QC happen again?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12942-0
<v Ricky Horton>After prep and after each total. OK,
is it 100% of everything is is QC or is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12942-1
<v Ricky Horton>it a sampling or depends on the contract
requirements for prep usually everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12974-0
<v Ricky Horton>For a for East Cove,
it's usually just a batch.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12974-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is it a is a documentation you're filling
out or is it? I'll just check it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12974-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/12990-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13040-0
<v Ricky Horton>The the reports you're filling out where
where I'm going with this is whether this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13040-1
<v Ricky Horton>is just a station we say cool 1B1 done or
whether we're saying 1B1 here's the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13040-2
<v Ricky Horton>here's the things that I checked.
Here's the things that we did.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13040-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm filling out a form for each piece or
is it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13074-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just done. No, it's just done.
I mean, once, well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13074-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's say we've got a truckload seal out
there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13074-2
<v Ricky Horton>It calls for an history 2 preferences of
pressure washing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13074-3
<v Ricky Horton>You make sure it's not oil or grime or
anything. All right, this load is good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13098-0
<v Ricky Horton>He checks it.
He can check off the peace marks,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13098-1
<v Ricky Horton>but he just takes pictures where the
report has to. He just takes pictures.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13098-2
<v Ricky Horton>Spaceball was done. That's it.
Do you guys use the flagging system?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or so let's say a guy checks and does 150
meetings. I don't know what issue,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-1
<v Ricky Horton>but three of them.
He didn't like some of them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-2
<v Ricky Horton>So typically one of the systems I'm used
to,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-3
<v Ricky Horton>the stuff that can move gets a coloured
flag.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-4
<v Ricky Horton>Stuff that doesn't gets a different
coloured flag going.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13151-5
<v Ricky Horton>Those got to be pulled.
Do you guys do that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13154-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do you know which one's the 4th?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13204-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we don't usually have issues on on
service. We do one or two pieces,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13204-1
<v Ricky Horton>you just get something out there.
Doesn't they just hit this again or does</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13204-2
<v Ricky Horton>the form and hit this again and you're
good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13204-3
<v Ricky Horton>Rarely have issues for service for for
when you do find,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13204-4
<v Ricky Horton>say a light spots or run stack.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13228-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or something.
They would grab the boot in their marking</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13228-1
<v Ricky Horton>tape. We didn't just put it on.
I'm used to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13228-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm used to a flagging taping system.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13228-3
<v Ricky Horton>otherwise the verbal part can't find the
guy who wants to take it down, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13228-4
<v Ricky Horton>whatever.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13271-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, no, we don't.
We don't have issues that we're not,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13271-1
<v Ricky Horton>I guess,
you guys have painting systems where you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13271-2
<v Ricky Horton>have to monitor environmental controls.
So how do you guys not environmental and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13271-3
<v Ricky Horton>that like it needs to be 30%?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13307-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do you guys know that the paint
system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13307-1
<v Ricky Horton>what what customer wants to report says
hey, during this period of time,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13307-2
<v Ricky Horton>the humidity will get a sunny guy do that.
They don't require that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13307-3
<v Ricky Horton>The customers require from us what they
call a paint log.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13333-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when we prep,
let's take all that pipe up here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13333-1
<v Ricky Horton>for example. When we prep, right,
we're going to take pictures of the pipe</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13333-2
<v Ricky Horton>happening to prep.
It was prep coming to SP2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13333-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm talking about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-0
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't done that one yet,
but this is a prime outs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-1
<v Ricky Horton>They got a paint system,
so they got their days,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to tell their viewpoint,
all that stuff,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then they'll report that.
They'll take it at the time that they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-4
<v Ricky Horton>going to paint and they'll put that
information in the report.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13380-5
<v Ricky Horton>Does all this go in the power fab or is
it just not going to the power fab?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13406-0
<v Ricky Horton>What what is being filled out is you can
create those forms within here so that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13406-1
<v Ricky Horton>they are a part of the system and it's
like I I did that with the bank where I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13406-2
<v Ricky Horton>was in the shop I used to be in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13447-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need all the environment stuff on there.
So any form became a document,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13447-1
<v Ricky Horton>became a record.
But I think if you have something that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13447-2
<v Ricky Horton>takes you a lot of time,
now is the time to ask because I think</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13447-3
<v Ricky Horton>the system can do it. Yeah.
And and so like when it was when you said.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13467-0
<v Ricky Horton>I feel this.
I say here's what we did to it and I'm</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13467-1
<v Ricky Horton>typing that out and I can move forward
with here attaching the pictures to me in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13467-2
<v Ricky Horton>here. So yeah,
that's what that's the whole KC portion</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13467-3
<v Ricky Horton>of it is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13501-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. Mm-hmm.
So this entire system will be contained</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13501-1
<v Ricky Horton>in as directly now. Yeah, he's on. Uh, go.
Yeah, he's out there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13501-2
<v Ricky Horton>You gotta take this following checks,
puts it in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13501-3
<v Ricky Horton>You guys get notifications that it's
completed and it's completed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13501-4
<v Ricky Horton>You can't move.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-0
<v Ricky Horton>Fly through the city to be more and still
it's done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you know the problem we're getting in
eight months that this will help.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I pulled up.
I pulled up on the pay months we had for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-3
<v Ricky Horton>the last meeting.
It was great deal with job,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-4
<v Ricky Horton>but it's the same report either way.
So it doesn't work if I need payment that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13544-5
<v Ricky Horton>must have been.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13576-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you got a section for environmentals.
Usually just take a picture of your age.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13576-1
<v Ricky Horton>It does a lot of environmentals like you
when it's viewpoint, it's cumulative.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13576-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's better.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13601-0
<v Ricky Horton>That one was an acid engine that a
pressure wash the coating material they</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13601-1
<v Ricky Horton>used in one coat.
So it's a prime intermediate top code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13601-2
<v Ricky Horton>They put in the batch numbers of paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13639-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then paying related information.
So shelf back thinner. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13639-1
<v Ricky Horton>see what else specific one sign off. Yeah,
we can build that into here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13639-2
<v Ricky Horton>The the thing that I always had a problem
with was the delay and stuff getting back</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13639-3
<v Ricky Horton>to where it needed to go. So there's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13672-0
<v Ricky Horton>Never can see anything because the forms
around the paint area, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13672-1
<v Ricky Horton>You can see that, right?
And so we put them in there and makes all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13672-2
<v Ricky Horton>electronics so successful.
I mean we can down the slide at that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13672-3
<v Ricky Horton>point.
So that's that would be easy to build so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13677-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, 'cause it's basically,
it's just that basically, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13680-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think we could do it now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13692-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a lot of benefits,
especially when you have these customers</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13692-1
<v Ricky Horton>that want shipping.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13712-0
<v Ricky Horton>They have multiple checks before they let
it go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13712-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like your document package has to be
complete. Mm-hmm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13712-2
<v Ricky Horton>Before you can even they give you a
trucking release.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13747-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is it so that everybody did it? Yeah,
everybody's had two or three estimates</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13747-1
<v Ricky Horton>reach out to me and check those down to
them over at the Gilbert facility.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13747-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's currently affecting our audit areas.
See if nobody can actually see can go</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13747-3
<v Ricky Horton>over fully.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13755-0
<v Ricky Horton>I messaged him multiple times.
He's in a meeting right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13755-1
<v Ricky Horton>He's responded, so he's no fault.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13771-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, yeah, second. What are you doing?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13801-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why did you do that? I'm not working on.
Is there a way while we're waiting that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13801-1
<v Ricky Horton>we kind of go, you know,
do these processes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13801-2
<v Ricky Horton>We've got to go here and get some buy in
on what what he wants. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13801-3
<v Ricky Horton>can you run the show?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13825-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or do anything with it.
So can you run locally?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13825-1
<v Ricky Horton>Can you run locally? I can,
but I don't have your system, so OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13840-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we have to use the the system.
We got the food then and duplicate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13840-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything that in the system.
After that we have lunch.</v>

<v Ricky Horton>And drink lots of water. I don't have.</v>

Oh, it's a good restaurant. I don't care.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13952-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to spend $5,
but I don't want to spend $100.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13952-3
<v Ricky Horton>But you know, I'd like.</v>

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13995-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a place called Eurega in Tanjin.
It's supposed to be pretty good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13995-1
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't been here yet,
but it's reasonably priced. 30 bucks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13995-2
<v Ricky Horton>I would like bar food more or less.
So like after work,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/13995-3
<v Ricky Horton>that's easy to get here or am I fighting
very good traffic?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14030-0
<v Ricky Horton>Traffic that way, this way, this way,
we're fine. That's it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14030-1
<v Ricky Horton>See that every time. OK,
so getting into town, no big deal.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14030-2
<v Ricky Horton>Just go up to 10. Yeah. All right.
So that way he's also going off the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14030-3
<v Ricky Horton>Broadway curb and he should be OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14033-0
<v Ricky Horton>But as far as that energy goes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14047-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we can, we recast the restaurant. Yeah,

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14047-1
<v Ricky Horton>both our food and the restaurants cost.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14070-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's it.
I don't know how he's in Tucson.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14070-1
<v Ricky Horton>Everything is down super expensive.
Oh yeah, that's nice.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14070-2

but I don't want to spend my products.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14087-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you. I tell you, it was funny,
between these two jobs,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14087-1
<v Ricky Horton>I went to Europe for a motorcycle.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14100-0
<v Ricky Horton>And my girlfriend was there and two cups

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14105-0
<v Ricky Horton>Come back here, that's 25 bucks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14120-0

<v Ricky Horton>you go to Firebirds and still spend $58 a
trip to go to Buck and Ryder yogurt. Yeah,</v>

<v Ricky Horton>45 bucks, which is not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14319-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I keep hearing about these good
places, but no invoice.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14319-1
<v Ricky Horton>They're over 30 minutes away from the
office. That's the stretch. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14319-2
<v Ricky Horton>from this office,
not in the Gilbert office.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14319-3
<v Ricky Horton>Gilbert office is a lot.
Gilbert office is and this option.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14346-0

<v Ricky Horton>that's that's the downtown Chandlers,
but that makes really so difference.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14354-0
<v Ricky Horton>Going to like, uh,
on the ostrich and speak easy. It's fine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14373-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really strong to insert. Why did that?
Why did that? It's fine, right? You know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14373-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was. I mean, it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14402-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it gets up loud. Yes,
the murmur turns into a slick steady yell.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14402-1
<v Ricky Horton>You're right next to the first thing
you're there, but then you're hollering.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14402-2
<v Ricky Horton>Say that right in my ear, please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14433-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can't speak very easily in the
speaking seat. Oh,</v>

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14441-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that one's cool.
That's the one that's like a ship. Yeah,</v>

<v Ricky Horton>that one's off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14462-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I I hope so. Yeah,
I thought Spooky been trying for a while</v>

<v Ricky Horton>there, trying to find a hidden gems.
We did the cooling and drop off fixing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14462-2
<v Ricky Horton>the pop up noise. It's not worth it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14496-0
<v Ricky Horton>The wife was having. So yeah,

<v Ricky Horton>I have an agenda.
I don't know if they build something in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14513-1
<v Ricky Horton>that parking lot.
I don't know if they took that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14513-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's still there. It shows.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14515-0

I've been a couple times. Cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14563-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know that back in the day when it
was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14563-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think there's only one in Scottsdale.
It's great. Yeah, it's really good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14563-3
<v Ricky Horton>And then they branched out and it just,
yeah, like a dog. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14563-4
<v Ricky Horton>they used to actually customize the menu.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14583-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and have interesting things.
Now what's the safety of the temptation</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14583-1
<v Ricky Horton>for everyone's?
Depends on what charts and be you're</v>

<v Ricky Horton>Was he better? Yeah, I'll use more.
I would like to listen to the second part</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14602-1
<v Ricky Horton>at Queen Creek until I approached the
option.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14638-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're actually trying to stop him from a
new offer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14638-1
<v Ricky Horton>Did you know who those homework? Oh,
I knew. Oh, I knew it was homework.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14638-2
<v Ricky Horton>But I also knew, crazy enough, that, like,
he put me in my car,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14638-3
<v Ricky Horton>like there was no problem like keeping up
with it, but it was a matter of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14684-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm like, if I was crazy down,
will for sure hit me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14684-1
<v Ricky Horton>It was crazy enough to keep his foot down.
Yeah, well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14684-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's funny that he's crazy enough to keep
his foot down.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14684-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's he's crazy enough that whether he
has from him or not,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14684-4
<v Ricky Horton>he's just going to be affected. Yeah,
he's one of those I miss.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14703-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just the exit and I'm driving within the
inches of the cargo to give back that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14703-1
<v Ricky Horton>little highway 'cause it was, it was like,
I'm just gonna like go with him and make</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14703-2
<v Ricky Horton>him like, take the exit.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14724-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then I was like, no,
it's probably used to battery in some of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14724-1
<v Ricky Horton>these countries where lanes don't matter.
Yes, he was telling me this morning that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14790-0
<v Ricky Horton>When he was in Saudi, he said.
I was telling him I was stuck in track.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14790-1
<v Ricky Horton>I said people just keep hitting their
wrists. I want to hit them so bad,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14790-2
<v Ricky Horton>he said. When I was in Saudi,
I had to hit the guy in front of me and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14790-3
<v Ricky Horton>ran into the barrels. It was funny,
I I was in one of the streets back in my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14790-4
<v Ricky Horton>youth and we were in Dubai.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14821-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're driving the license plates on our
Jake. It's number one and it's down. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14821-1
<v Ricky Horton>there's seven United Arab Emirates, right?
And so I'm Austin and I are 10,000, 6000.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14843-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we go to a parking lot.
We're not supposed to be driving.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14843-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have a driving car. So first mistake,
you shouldn't be driving.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14843-2
<v Ricky Horton>We turn this Mercedes coming around us,
my boss.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14871-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey man, you got #38 boot.
The guy steps out, military dude.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14871-1
<v Ricky Horton>Another car drives and takes the
passenger and they're gone.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14871-2
<v Ricky Horton>The military and their car show up,
their buddies. I said. What do you think,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14871-3
<v Ricky Horton>man? Hand or a foot?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14881-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like, what?
It's like punishment here is every</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14881-1
<v Ricky Horton>Thursday.
They're gonna take a hand or a foot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14906-0
<v Ricky Horton>But we, uh, try. I don't know.
We had to spend six hours until our fixer</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14906-1
<v Ricky Horton>got to sell. And then we're not allowed.
I mean, we're not allowed to drive anyway.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14906-2
<v Ricky Horton>That was a billion dollars.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14974-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's crazy about the country example.
Customs are very different.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14974-1
<v Ricky Horton>Saturday was close.
When I said the right lanes are more for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14974-2
<v Ricky Horton>like center in like you center the car.
In China, they don't give a ****. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14974-3
<v Ricky Horton>same in the same way in Saturday.
There was there was a guy that *******</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14974-4
<v Ricky Horton>cut currently. So it was 6 lane.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14979-0
<v Ricky Horton>Road all the way from the left.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14983-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's that time ready, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/14984-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15006-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, kind of. I don't know,
'cause you there's sometimes over the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15006-1
<v Ricky Horton>years I see the the the issues driving
the stereotypes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15006-2
<v Ricky Horton>I see a lot of those guys like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15025-0
<v Ricky Horton>South America wants crazy.
It's all like countries. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15025-1
<v Ricky Horton>but at the same time, Arizona better.
I'm just going to say that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but they try not to help you.
So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15069-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was gonna do the 50 on ******* 65 when
everyone's doing names.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15069-2
<v Ricky Horton>They ought to find the people who are
creating traffic and take their license.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15069-3
<v Ricky Horton>No,
just just just give all my like pardon</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15069-4
<v Ricky Horton>for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15079-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't stop causing traffic. That'll be OK.
I'm sooner. He will have a situation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15079-1
<v Ricky Horton>You have a parking for a year and go
clear the way.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15080-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15084-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's for real.
How long is this happening?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15084-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's happening.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15114-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, usually it's about 20 minutes,
but usually IT is relatively available.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15114-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just reset the server and and then
we're back up and down.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15114-2
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to just you want to just hit
it? I wish no.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15114-3
<v Ricky Horton>So now put all of our drives down and
then more systems will have to be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15114-4
<v Ricky Horton>restarted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15117-0
<v Ricky Horton>So far.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15154-0
<v Ricky Horton>Kind of it is a log.
If they give me access to the server,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15154-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can go on and reboot it.
It takes about a minute to reboot the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15154-2
<v Ricky Horton>server and this will get back up.
I just don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15154-3
<v Ricky Horton>I need to have an IT administrative login
to be able to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15185-0
<v Ricky Horton>They've added so many different firewalls,
different safety checks that everything's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15185-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can't even can barely update my
Google Chrome without having to ask for a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15185-2
<v Ricky Horton>yes, please.
I was going to say that you can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15188-0
<v Ricky Horton>He did not miss it, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15237-0
<v Ricky Horton>So even the even the programs that I have
company installed on here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15237-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can't update without. Yeah, I asked him.
That's why when somebody comes on with my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15237-2
<v Ricky Horton>system is like, hey,
can you pick these up in the states? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15237-3
<v Ricky Horton>well that was the same thing with this
tech update.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15237-4
<v Ricky Horton>I put in a request for the tech update in
the beginning of November.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15271-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then I got to the summer and I was
like, this has to be done on 12/3, no ifs,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15271-1
<v Ricky Horton>ands or buts.
And then it got done on 12/3 and night</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15271-2
<v Ricky Horton>time.
So we were working through all the issues</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15271-3
<v Ricky Horton>on Thursday last week,
getting everything buttoned up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15311-0
<v Ricky Horton>Server restart, server restart,
everything's down in the morning and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15311-1
<v Ricky Horton>because they have all of these processes
in place,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15311-2
<v Ricky Horton>IT had to go to every single computer
manually to install the update.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15311-3
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas before we used to be able to just
go to the location where the update was,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15311-4
<v Ricky Horton>run it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15352-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it was updated and we're good to
go. Yep,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15352-1
<v Ricky Horton>to get in the morning it would have a
full file after you just started.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15352-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can do it. Yep, it would.
And they use the. Hey,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15352-3
<v Ricky Horton>your database is updated.
We notice there's a an updated update</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15352-4
<v Ricky Horton>file in the folder.
Would you like to install this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15393-0
<v Ricky Horton>When you're built,
obviously the property and you are now we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15393-1
<v Ricky Horton>have to go through this tedious process,
but we don't have enough IT personnel to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15393-2
<v Ricky Horton>design above and Keith,
Keith's on help desk,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15393-3
<v Ricky Horton>but nothing's going to change. So I don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15414-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can't. Some of the updates I can't.
I can't. Now I've got IT admin line.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15414-1
<v Ricky Horton>I love that we still have a plan and
Taylor's number up there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15414-2
<v Ricky Horton>All the safety personalities.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15416-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15449-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shots where it seems like we're not going
to allow me to do a good and I'm</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15449-1
<v Ricky Horton>considered a hole in the firewall.
There's safety precautions for that and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15449-2
<v Ricky Horton>they can do, but they're like, no,
I'm going to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15491-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I was at one shop and IT said that
and they were an outside IT firm that the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15491-1
<v Ricky Horton>owner had hired. They're like,
we're not allowed to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15491-2
<v Ricky Horton>And the owner's like, yeah, you are.
This isn't my system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15491-3
<v Ricky Horton>I bet you you're not going to tell me
that I can't do it. I can't do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15512-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you got that.
So there was an error last week that I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15512-1
<v Ricky Horton>sent over and I see that initially that
was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15541-0
<v Ricky Horton>With this 2013 lost connection to server
doing query blah blah blah blah database</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15541-1
<v Ricky Horton>connection logs and then restart and so
then we ended up going to techlist</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15541-2
<v Ricky Horton>support and then that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15572-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's essentially the ITC technical
support said that that error code is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15572-1
<v Ricky Horton>vague and now you'll be see the trouble
shooter.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15572-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they'll need to know if it's going to
the same work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15599-0
<v Ricky Horton>And could you provide us any solid
feedback other than confirming that we're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15599-1
<v Ricky Horton>on the AS My hospital version and they're
known for this version? I got it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15599-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just we're detailing though.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15635-0
<v Ricky Horton>Most of it's all extremely, sorry,
external Indian or external somewhere US.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15635-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have a couple of options on the US,
but there is one of our main retailers is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15635-2
<v Ricky Horton>a yeah, that'd be link. So I well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15656-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's the name of your idea?
What she was asking there is one of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15656-1
<v Ricky Horton>main ones that we use.
Sockeye detailing is in the US,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15656-2
<v Ricky Horton>South Dakota based ANC.
We also use them there in Asia,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15656-3
<v Ricky Horton>but they're a main branch that takes up
California.</v>

<v Ricky Horton>All over the US. Who's going?
Who's like a good like a small</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15691-1
<v Ricky Horton>miscellaneous metal packet that I see
coming through from the mine sites?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15691-2
<v Ricky Horton>Who's doing those?
They can do anything from big contracts</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15691-3
<v Ricky Horton>and a little miscellaneous.
They have a pretty.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15719-0
<v Ricky Horton>Three is the main contacts that oversee
our projects.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15719-1
<v Ricky Horton>One of the contacts does big projects,
one of the contacts does little projects</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15719-2
<v Ricky Horton>and one does.
So and how much back and forth is Sir?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15757-0
<v Ricky Horton>It it kind of depends on what we supply
them with. With them,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15757-1
<v Ricky Horton>I like them because they'll ask the
question if there's anything uncertain,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15757-2
<v Ricky Horton>otherwise they'll buy in from the census.
How does that work with the time</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15757-3
<v Ricky Horton>difference?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15802-0
<v Ricky Horton>Usually they're pretty on point.
Most of their most of our contacts are in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15802-1
<v Ricky Horton>the US.
The people who are physically doing the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15802-2
<v Ricky Horton>detailing, they're sending to our seats.
So the people drawing it up,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15802-3
<v Ricky Horton>but our contacts,
they're always readily available for us.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15802-4
<v Ricky Horton>Occasionally, worst case.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15838-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's something like really early in the
morning from them,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15838-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they they were late and they'll ask
me my questions.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15838-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you won't see the job until the PO is
left by the customer. Most of the time,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15838-3
<v Ricky Horton>yes.
Sometimes they'll get ahead of the ball</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15838-4
<v Ricky Horton>game and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15865-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll be in detailing with the notice to
proceed without appeal or contract with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15865-1
<v Ricky Horton>him. How about this Arizona water tank?
Who does that Arizona water tank?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15865-2
<v Ricky Horton>A lot of that's done by detailing.
He's kind of one of the small projects</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15865-3
<v Ricky Horton>kind of guy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15874-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's second term in the US stock on it.
S OK on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15888-0
<v Ricky Horton>SSOCKDYDW something I'm in trouble with.
Something like the Sam and yes, it's Sam.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15888-1
<v Ricky Horton>Very well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15910-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you get the tech from the handbook?
It's updated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15910-1
<v Ricky Horton>Do you think that you guys are going to
get this tank job? Yeah, so it was that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15941-0
<v Ricky Horton>I just think about yourself. I am not. OK.
No, Rob, where's the water?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15941-1
<v Ricky Horton>Brandon is telling me about it. Oh, OK.
If we're in Mexico, then it's white. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15941-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's mine. So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15942-0
<v Ricky Horton>I thought it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15962-0
<v Ricky Horton>So there's a lot of things.
I don't think that's hearing on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15962-1
<v Ricky Horton>plugins. It's usually the major,
major cities, the other two,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15962-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I think it's not for things.
So they're going to add them like this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15968-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, certainly fine. But um,
and then again, we're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15995-0
<v Ricky Horton>Would you try?
Would you try to do it or would you try</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15995-1
<v Ricky Horton>to move yourself it?
What is the dealt which is those two?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/15995-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to pull it here off and see if
I can get it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16020-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he was asking me, you know, for me,
those are easy things. But for here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16020-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. No, we don't.
We don't do 10,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16020-2
<v Ricky Horton>but we did some up this Saturday.
We've done some before.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16039-0
<v Ricky Horton>We ended up doing any sections and
piecing it all together,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16039-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it it was such a pain that we ended
up. Yeah, we really got pains, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16042-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
there are not actually two of Chuck's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16042-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys. No, no, no, it's one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16063-0
<v Ricky Horton>The Chuck guys work on a tanker from 13
years to allowing. Well, the door sheet,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16063-1
<v Ricky Horton>Central Heights. Yeah,
they asked me about dental.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16064-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16097-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they asked if we could roll that.
He said an 8 foot radius.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16097-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can go by 8 foot.
We got a 10 foot wide liberal.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16097-2
<v Ricky Horton>So anything over there we're going to be
placed in the 10 foot sessions.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16097-3
<v Ricky Horton>So but that anybody as long as we got two
guys on it, so we can roll with it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you going through earlier or what are
we doing?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're putting a new door sheet on it. Yes,
Max reached out to me about it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-2
<v Ricky Horton>He's asking me a bunch of questions.
It sounds like he submitted on it. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-3
<v Ricky Horton>we did the door sheet,
but thing is we were planning on using</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-4
<v Ricky Horton>the same one.
We just we just took it off of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16144-5
<v Ricky Horton>meeting side of the bank.
I think tomorrow they're going to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16166-0
<v Ricky Horton>They could swing it back in last time.
Yeah, because that's no,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16166-1
<v Ricky Horton>this was right and that's right.
We're reproducing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16166-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's when the last time we pulled down.
That's a bad one. Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16182-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, holy crap. No response. Oh,
that's how people. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16182-1
<v Ricky Horton>it only took almost an hour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16187-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it figured itself out,
but you're desperate on time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16191-0
<v Ricky Horton>They checked.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16195-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they go to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16196-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16198-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16220-0
<v Ricky Horton>I thought we're going to be 20.4,
Citrus and 35. I don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16220-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see what I'm on. Yeah,
that's the one that I'm running too, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16229-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's only since you weren't trying to
play fill out, really, just since start.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16256-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's the that's really it's
pretty cut back process. It shouldn't be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16256-1
<v Ricky Horton>It is. It's very simple process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16259-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I guess it is what it is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16267-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is our this is our TSMC job that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16280-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm gonna spend some time after hours on
today,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16280-1
<v Ricky Horton>but this is the one that you guys are
gonna be killing is the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16283-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16289-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a decent amount of things on this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16293-0
<v Ricky Horton>But our finish is we've got.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16322-0
<v Ricky Horton>Quite a few different conditions.
I that that's actually fairly including</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16322-1
<v Ricky Horton>to what I see from that a lot of shops.
So believe it or not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16322-2
<v Ricky Horton>So do we want to sounds like production
is most important.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16346-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we want to look at routes and set
things up and then I will walk through</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16346-1
<v Ricky Horton>and say here's what it would look like.
Yeah, that's probably your best bet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16365-0
<v Ricky Horton>Put another fabrication maintenance way
out there. Oh, that's right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16365-1
<v Ricky Horton>They may be just in the stations that we
want for pavings we want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16369-0
<v Ricky Horton>Bread from what we want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16408-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when we, let's say we set it up,
we set up for the most complex system is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16408-1
<v Ricky Horton>going to be a prep, prime,
intermediate and Tacos going to be a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16408-2
<v Ricky Horton>great global ship back.
Barney was a portal system too,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16408-3
<v Ricky Horton>but we can assign how many stations we
have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16426-0
<v Ricky Horton>For a job, right? Yeah.
The only challenge with this that you'll</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16426-1
<v Ricky Horton>have is that still the Ramsey,
very seminals of stations. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16426-2
<v Ricky Horton>More smoothly routes, yes. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16457-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what we do and is it gonna get
affected by the finishes I guess.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16457-1
<v Ricky Horton>So let's say for finished you got painted
and unpainment right now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16457-2
<v Ricky Horton>but if we want to do like that,
say SP2 and shot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16459-0
<v Ricky Horton>That SP3 and shot point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16496-0
<v Ricky Horton>With the number of posts,
they can get fairly complicated. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16496-1
<v Ricky Horton>we pretty much use our simple paint
linear when we do a simple paint linear</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16496-2
<v Ricky Horton>or and then the simple paint linear.
It's pretty just calling up the two</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16496-3
<v Ricky Horton>different kinds of press.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16522-0
<v Ricky Horton>The on those are basic enough that I
would think those could both fall on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16522-1
<v Ricky Horton>same level of simple just because they're
it's not necessarily coming from blast</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16522-2
<v Ricky Horton>and blast is where we want to go like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16568-0
<v Ricky Horton>Complex P,
so linear CP and then six and then that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16568-1
<v Ricky Horton>one can have that one.
We can add more routes to it or add more</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16568-2
<v Ricky Horton>stations to it so that it has a little
bit more granular tracking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16568-3
<v Ricky Horton>The other two it tracks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16607-0
<v Ricky Horton>Similar of you want the cloud,
you want to prime and then a different</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16607-1
<v Ricky Horton>model of the client if you were going to
go for a complex and you need to finish</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16607-2
<v Ricky Horton>code because each of those is going to
have an inspection tied to it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16607-3
<v Ricky Horton>takes the problem,
the station to be added to it and the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16607-4
<v Ricky Horton>rock sits assigned to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16639-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not saying you do this long ago,
so if we got a job we want to start going</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16639-1
<v Ricky Horton>through this and it's others, the decent,
see where it's just the simple present</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16639-2
<v Ricky Horton>time. You can go into the job pack. Yeah,
you can do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16639-3
<v Ricky Horton>And the idea right now is for us to set
up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-0
<v Ricky Horton>One,
tweak our current fab routes that are</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-1
<v Ricky Horton>going to associate coatings with it so
that it has your stacking to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-2
<v Ricky Horton>So when we're loading something through
the system and it's going to be,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're just applying routes like we always
do and you just incorporate the art as</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-4
<v Ricky Horton>its tracking to it,
but then also defining your separate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16684-5
<v Ricky Horton>routes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16713-0
<v Ricky Horton>That if you guys import KISS file and you
want to run a simple paint tracking,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16713-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's it.
You can globally edit all the assemblies</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16713-2
<v Ricky Horton>and you have that there.
Then all those inspections are popping up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16713-3
<v Ricky Horton>for you guys in the in the in the shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16762-0
<v Ricky Horton>And and the stations can be set
processing the stations saying they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16762-1
<v Ricky Horton>going to be separate from the QC as well.
In other words,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16762-2
<v Ricky Horton>so we can be able to QC test that here
and they can process that station saying</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16762-3
<v Ricky Horton>that station is done.
So that you can do like a.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16791-0
<v Ricky Horton>And saying prep is going to or crime.
The crime is done by filling out that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16791-1
<v Ricky Horton>inspection list or you can just even say
I process this station without having to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16791-2
<v Ricky Horton>fill out a QC list and certainly be done
either or.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16825-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's why I was asking if it was a
sampling or it was 100%,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16825-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's actually every single one.
How do you so you probably get asked</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16825-2
<v Ricky Horton>what's your capacity? Do you have time?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16829-0
<v Ricky Horton>In three weeks to pay something.
You probably could ask that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16842-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you going to is are we gonna want the
scheduling part to be able to handle that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16854-0
<v Ricky Horton>Seems like you'd like that. Yeah,
I'd like that actually plan ourselves to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16854-1
<v Ricky Horton>work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16895-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's great to say yes to that.
I get it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16895-1
<v Ricky Horton>but eventually you're going to have so
much work that you won't be able to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16895-2
<v Ricky Horton>that. That's the goal, right?
So you got to really be able to say,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16895-3
<v Ricky Horton>squeeze it in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16914-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think you want to skip it. I want to be.
I'd like to skip it right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16914-1
<v Ricky Horton>The way I go about it is I'm like,
book the shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16914-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's really so hard that you don't have
to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16931-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you move between intermediate and
final or you just let it sit there and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16931-1
<v Ricky Horton>you paint the same place? No,
you just let it sit there and paint the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16931-2
<v Ricky Horton>same place.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16961-0
<v Ricky Horton>But the only move,
the only move you have is from prep to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16961-1
<v Ricky Horton>blast, blast from blast and paint.
That's essentially it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16961-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's prepped in place in the paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16963-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but that was when you were.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16989-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's gonna be capacity by area.
I'm just getting to the point of capacity</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16989-1
<v Ricky Horton>by area,
but sometimes you'd have more or less</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16989-2
<v Ricky Horton>blasting capacity or more or less
painting capacity.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16999-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the past time lasted where I wanted to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/16999-1
<v Ricky Horton>and painted where I wanted to,
so the capacity wasn't really.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17000-0
<v Ricky Horton>They.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17023-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just build it into the functionality,
whether you can use it or not, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17023-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just, I think,
I think make it as flexible as possible,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17023-2
<v Ricky Horton>right? Now what you're saying right? Yeah,
but just have the the work center.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17030-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you know the capacity of that works
number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17048-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not to figure out the capacity, yeah,
but because if we run everything through</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17048-1
<v Ricky Horton>the building like we're supposed to,
that's really easy to have that small</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17048-2
<v Ricky Horton>square feet. Don't need to have the laser.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17079-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean,
is that air quality thing going to happen</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17079-1
<v Ricky Horton>in the next year or the next month?
You know all about that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17079-2
<v Ricky Horton>I hope it doesn't happen, right?
I can see it. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17079-3
<v Ricky Horton>we ended up having houses nearby as and
all of a sudden.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17082-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our whole painting system had to be
changed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17113-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, so we've got the stations in here.
Now it's just incorporating those in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17113-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you mentioned Wes,
we'd want to go even further than this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17113-2
<v Ricky Horton>but right now we've got prep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17150-0
<v Ricky Horton>Prime, intermediate code,
finished code and most of the basics</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17150-1
<v Ricky Horton>would be a six to seven to add into our
standard production route of prep and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17150-2
<v Ricky Horton>prime and then I would just have to
associate an inspection to your prep or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17150-3
<v Ricky Horton>prime.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17192-0
<v Ricky Horton>Since you guys are already doing your
your checks at those points and then that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17192-1
<v Ricky Horton>can give us a percentage of complete in
production for the side.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17192-2
<v Ricky Horton>Got a job we can apply us to do that
remember we'll let build the the wrap but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17232-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're not what we can apply to right now.
So then we can have a, yeah, say, hey,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17232-1
<v Ricky Horton>let's go out and let's see what this will
look like out there. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17232-2
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't this TSMC Fab 3,
I haven't used for Fab yet,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17232-3
<v Ricky Horton>but we are gonna be coding in here in
house, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17255-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can apply the production and put these
routes to that and now we can be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17255-1
<v Ricky Horton>available and we can give it a shot.
Do you keep your stations together by</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17255-2
<v Ricky Horton>paint and by weld?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17305-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right now it's kind of Willy nilly in
here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17305-1
<v Ricky Horton>but in theory this would be set up at the
same layout of shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17305-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm through because I noticed you've got
finish code as 32,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17305-3
<v Ricky Horton>but a lot of your painting is in the
teens. Yes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17305-4
<v Ricky Horton>those are ones that I've so these are
ones that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17336-0
<v Ricky Horton>And after the fact,
these are ones that are early stages that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17336-1
<v Ricky Horton>we are in the initial,
which is what we have. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17336-2
<v Ricky Horton>we gave everybody blocks of 10,
tried to keep them together, blocks of 10.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17336-3
<v Ricky Horton>So like you're the painting guy,
you want your stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17373-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know you're always going to be in the
70s,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17373-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they don't see the numbers anyway.
They don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17373-2
<v Ricky Horton>They don't see the description. So, OK,
I'm used to seeing both numbers and at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17373-3
<v Ricky Horton>least we're in the process of it out on
the floor.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17373-4
<v Ricky Horton>They'll just see the description. So OK,
but not what about the office?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17405-0
<v Ricky Horton>Pretty much subscription.
It's not unless you will see it. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17405-1
<v Ricky Horton>is there like a report or something you
pull in where the numbers are filtered?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17405-2
<v Ricky Horton>So let's say you want to pull.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17453-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now you want to see the pieces that are
following this path or using these steps</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17453-1
<v Ricky Horton>and numbers. If you have a code slot 70,
you want to see everything that's called</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17453-2
<v Ricky Horton>7 the the the builders.
You can get your step through for more.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17453-3
<v Ricky Horton>What's the script?
So you'll you'll have a right by the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17453-4
<v Ricky Horton>spreadsheet and not by.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17462-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's not ideal, so I can ask prime code.
How many square feet of prime did we do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17462-1
<v Ricky Horton>in January?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17464-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17466-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17493-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's not going to be a report
specifically that says that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17493-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I ought to be able to pull all the
pieces that went through that station and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17493-2
<v Ricky Horton>see how I can see the square footage
point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17509-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, we won't do it in a route.
The next thing I want to know is what's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17509-1
<v Ricky Horton>the difference to how much SP510 or six
did we get?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17517-0
<v Ricky Horton>I want with this 10 or five.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17527-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now, if I was even with anything,
but of course they might even give you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17527-1
<v Ricky Horton>water. That's part of water.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17542-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe the old gas industry sometime in
the car sometime. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17542-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to think you're right,
but not much, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17552-0
<v Ricky Horton>He was always the semiconductor guys with
persnickety on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Finish.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17558-0
<v Ricky Horton>On the blast.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17565-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the line.
I think I was bringing ain't big enough.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17592-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here received the job site,
which received the job site we didn't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17592-1
<v Ricky Horton>really need in there. Honestly, Yep,
we'll make it happen instead of shipping,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17592-2
<v Ricky Horton>the shipping sites tracking,
just an extra category.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17594-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17600-0
<v Ricky Horton>Make changes but here actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17607-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
you'll say how you want to describe this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17607-1
<v Ricky Horton>for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17611-0
<v Ricky Horton>All the different stations.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17614-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17633-0
<v Ricky Horton>Complete 3B station version was on for a
prime,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17633-1
<v Ricky Horton>but nothing else you wanted on for other
stations.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17636-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or do you want it all off?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17666-0
<v Ricky Horton>This one because this is cut to size
before the order cut to size plates that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17666-1
<v Ricky Horton>are going out. So what does that mean?
You have to set the quantity as complete</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17666-2
<v Ricky Horton>before you can move it.
So like with with the way it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17712-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you try to pick from the brand at mid
there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17712-1
<v Ricky Horton>they will put a fly and say you can do it.
So yeah, it's kind of holds you again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17712-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you see there's follow and show
letting their stuff in accurately on time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17712-3
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, there is, but there's time.
So if you put in QC.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17716-0
<v Ricky Horton>Before or after present after private.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17773-0
<v Ricky Horton>Those are going to be have to be tied to
a report where you can just split that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17773-1
<v Ricky Horton>step so Chris, for example,
can go out there and mark that each piece</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17773-2
<v Ricky Horton>of the PC without the reporter blocking
it from moving to the next step.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17773-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if I don't tie an inspection to it,
you would then just have to go to the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17773-4
<v Ricky Horton>park tracking and when you're marked off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17807-0
<v Ricky Horton>The quantity that he checked.
If I add it in there as a quality control</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17807-1
<v Ricky Horton>step,
then I would tie an inspection to it and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17807-2
<v Ricky Horton>they'll fill out a report for each one.
But it's not 100%,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17807-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's in the district body piece,
so if it's not inspected 100% it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17838-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we don't really want that as part of
the route because then it's going to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17838-1
<v Ricky Horton>require you to do it all here every
single piece. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17838-2
<v Ricky Horton>not necessarily at the time,
but I mean you have, you have your,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17838-3
<v Ricky Horton>can you make the same stuff about tiny
time inspection?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17865-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean as a whole,
if you guys are the same quality control</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17865-1
<v Ricky Horton>step, but you have all these steps,
so we'll be here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17865-2
<v Ricky Horton>nothing's not anything you said.
Copy a step and change the description to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17865-3
<v Ricky Horton>whatever you want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17911-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe oversimplifying it,
but what are you saying now?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17911-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not following.
So you have all these steps in here on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17911-2
<v Ricky Horton>the top side,
but is any of it tied to anything</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17911-3
<v Ricky Horton>inspection to you have to have this done
before you can move to this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17911-4
<v Ricky Horton>that kind of stuff. Yeah,
so that's what that complete previous.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17946-0
<v Ricky Horton>The inspection first is it would say you
can't do the next step unless the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17946-1
<v Ricky Horton>previous one was done.
Now whether it's tied to the inspection</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17946-2
<v Ricky Horton>test or not is is different than that.
The inspection test just says if I if I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17946-3
<v Ricky Horton>successfully pass an inspection test.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17990-0
<v Ricky Horton>It will process a section.
So if crime was always going to be an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17990-1
<v Ricky Horton>inspection test,
it's always 100% I want to do every</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17990-2
<v Ricky Horton>single piece.
I thought of an inspection test and let Q</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17990-3
<v Ricky Horton>and QC is processing that, not the guys,
because if guys said I I primed it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17990-4
<v Ricky Horton>but they but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17992-0
<v Ricky Horton>QC fails it. Now I got a false positive,
so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/17999-0
<v Ricky Horton>Quality control.
Can you set um a sampling?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18017-0
<v Ricky Horton>It will not. It will not pop up and say,
hey, we're going 20% here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18017-1
<v Ricky Horton>He's not using any. Yeah,
you got to choose feedback, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18022-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
the other is going to be in order to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18022-1
<v Ricky Horton>overtribe so I can kind of see it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18027-0
<v Ricky Horton>But oh, excuse me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18050-0
<v Ricky Horton>And can you have that same test twice or
you're going to have to label it prime</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18050-1
<v Ricky Horton>QAQC and that one and two and it's you
can't talk basically.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18101-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's what it's in there right now,
but it's not tied to inspection, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18101-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be. So,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18101-2
<v Ricky Horton>but if you're doing it for for that,
then yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18101-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would probably be able to do an
inspection here or an inspection for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18101-4
<v Ricky Horton>because.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18120-0
<v Ricky Horton>Completed this successful class and you
will process the session.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18120-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you're not able to do both.
In other words,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18120-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have to fill out a form and say I
process the session with you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18136-0
<v Ricky Horton>When you say process or form,
is that digital on an iPad or are we?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18136-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so there's no transcribing required.
Great.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18156-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
that's why I think we say if you if you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18156-1
<v Ricky Horton>are going out,
listen to get it in here because it makes</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18156-2
<v Ricky Horton>it live and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18200-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is it smart enough that it pre-populates
standard stuff or do you have to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18200-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything every time?
What do you mean pre-populate standard</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18200-2
<v Ricky Horton>stuff? I don't know.
Let's say I have a QC guy and I had a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18200-3
<v Ricky Horton>weather station out there and I gave it
the order every morning,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18200-4
<v Ricky Horton>grabbed the weather station data.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18253-0
<v Ricky Horton>And automatically take my form past the
weather station.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18253-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't have to go look up,
but the humidity is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18253-2
<v Ricky Horton>These are basically like 3 form bills
you're filling out. I can do a checkbox,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18253-3
<v Ricky Horton>I can do a drop down, I can do a text box,
a number, a date, whatever,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18253-4
<v Ricky Horton>but it's something to read from anywhere.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18262-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's not gonna be not gonna be pull
all that. So well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18262-1
<v Ricky Horton>remember what I did yesterday.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18302-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, let's say I was the same job,
right? And I did the Monday report.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18302-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is all the stuff going to be there for
the Tuesday report except the differences?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18302-2
<v Ricky Horton>I got to do all the stuff every time.
Now there's an option in there to say</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18302-3
<v Ricky Horton>copy from previous tests.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18311-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's some previous tests I just did,
like I was out there and I did crime and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18311-1
<v Ricky Horton>then, you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18373-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is how long will it take to fill out
the report?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18373-1
<v Ricky Horton>Depends on what what the one that you
want, how many you want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18373-2
<v Ricky Horton>So depends on the second seconds.
If I build these and I want to very click</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18373-3
<v Ricky Horton>friendly, right?
So literally we're defined in the fields.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18373-4
<v Ricky Horton>So if I've defined 25 fields, then click,
click, click, click, click, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18396-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
so this is this is like our inspection</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18396-1
<v Ricky Horton>that we've defined in here and added the
minimum information that we need possible</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18396-2
<v Ricky Horton>to do this and then if you're him.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18398-0
<v Ricky Horton>We shouldn't even have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18403-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've got a little mine inspections.
I think it's going to get on wrong,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18403-1
<v Ricky Horton>probably go to the traffic instead of
seeing if we want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18404-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18406-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see if we got it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18421-0
<v Ricky Horton>So once you plan on your project,
build your inspections,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18421-1
<v Ricky Horton>select your assembly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18433-0
<v Ricky Horton>Doing here some of the inspection and
then get fit up so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18474-0
<v Ricky Horton>Of course there's no routes. OK, perfect.
So from here we can see it passed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18474-1
<v Ricky Horton>So this is what the information looks
like on here, but if you're on EBM go,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18474-2
<v Ricky Horton>this is how it looks in the shop and then
you fill out this information.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18510-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like your location,
which inspector did it test on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18510-1
<v Ricky Horton>employee checkbox for passing.
You can add notes if it was performed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18510-2
<v Ricky Horton>So everything from employee to mail
discuss models,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18510-3
<v Ricky Horton>whatever you want because that was built
from scratch.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18532-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's whatever you want it.
Do we have standard inspection forms?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18532-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we haven't already built the site.
That's what we use.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18532-2
<v Ricky Horton>Do we want to build and move them to here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18533-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18538-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's gonna be piece by piece.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18587-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want the guy spending three hours
when I have a truck or two truck was a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18587-1
<v Ricky Horton>stupid line. So what are your forms?
What do your forms currently do right now?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18587-2
<v Ricky Horton>I just so it's a section for environment,
a section for the paint we use and an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18587-3
<v Ricky Horton>open field section where we have
environment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18621-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So that's that's the difference.
This would be about moving up to 1V1 and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18621-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm expecting, I'm expecting 1V1. Yeah.
Now if I'm doing my environmentals that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18621-2
<v Ricky Horton>applies to everything I do that day,
right. So that's a totally different form.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18621-3
<v Ricky Horton>We can build this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18661-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that would be a problem.
This is just the guy saying I've</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18661-1
<v Ricky Horton>completed this step. Yeah,
this step on each piece.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18661-2
<v Ricky Horton>If we build those forms in here,
is it just going to be essentially it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18661-3
<v Ricky Horton>replacing side docks? Well, I'm assuming,
I'm, I'm assuming.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18698-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's,
is site docs just that form and you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18698-1
<v Ricky Horton>filling it out, site docs,
we were using it for all our forms of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18698-2
<v Ricky Horton>JSAS and other forms.
They would they prebuilt the forms in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18698-3
<v Ricky Horton>there that anyone would go and pull up
the form you need.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18728-0
<v Ricky Horton>Fill it out, submit it,
then you can export it or do whatever</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18728-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's our it's record-keeping system
to be local forms,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18728-2
<v Ricky Horton>but they're trying to get us something
else which isn't more than at least with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18728-3
<v Ricky Horton>that. So, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18733-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're actively trying to get rid of
something else. Is that correct?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18780-0
<v Ricky Horton>They want us to stop using site docs,
but they have what we need in the other</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18780-1
<v Ricky Horton>side of course,
so that's what we're still using at least</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18780-2
<v Ricky Horton>for that for those. I mean,
I was going to say for that particular</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18780-3
<v Ricky Horton>thing, if if it's not tied to a piece,
I don't know that I would move it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18823-0
<v Ricky Horton>In other words, don't break, you know,
don't fix it. It's not broken, right? So,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18823-1
<v Ricky Horton>but if you're needing to rid of it anyway,
we'll spill it real quick and show you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18823-2
<v Ricky Horton>what it looks like.
The the biggest limitation of fixing that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18823-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want is I don't want to cut it a
piece back and stuff, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18863-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that that wouldn't be appropriate.
So just think of this in a four wheeler.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18863-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's all it gets.
You can talk to me or you can say no,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18863-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to talk to me or I can talk
to a truck if I wanted to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18863-3
<v Ricky Horton>I can do that if I wanted to be better.
But then it's it's very customizable.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18863-4
<v Ricky Horton>So let let me tell you what I use.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18905-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then it's it's an inspection model,
so I'll tell you what I use it for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18905-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I did use it for a piece by piece
inspection. OK, so I I could be 1B1.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18905-2
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't get check on it.
I didn't wheel check, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18905-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it's designed to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18953-0
<v Ricky Horton>I also used it for OK,
a truck's doing that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18953-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've been accused on trucks.
My shipping guys were really terrible.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18953-2
<v Ricky Horton>So this guy had come to this guy's truck
and say everything was on and take</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18953-3
<v Ricky Horton>pictures of it and attach it to the
record. I used it for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/18953-4
<v Ricky Horton>I also used it for just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19000-0
<v Ricky Horton>A general form type thing.
So we did do about a minute on there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19000-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we did all that. We did come, man.
I had in the morning on the floor that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19000-2
<v Ricky Horton>you got to do inspection on on the floor.
I did that in there. It was just a form,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19000-3
<v Ricky Horton>so it's just a formula.
So it can be very generic.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19000-4
<v Ricky Horton>It can be very specific.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19002-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19032-0
<v Ricky Horton>And what the I guess you guys know about
that is it. So if I have my green guys,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19032-1
<v Ricky Horton>they want to start putting reports in
here and they're going to have to have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19032-2
<v Ricky Horton>licenses and all that kind of stuff or
yes, what?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
if we're going to ditch site possibly,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19069-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to start using the ports here.
That's why I'm asking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19069-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to start.
If we're going to use for ports in here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19069-3
<v Ricky Horton>we just need to give them BP to go access
and those are a lot cheaper than a full</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19069-4
<v Ricky Horton>power band and go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19114-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we can, we can increase our amount.
It's like 15 bucks more than one than an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19114-1
<v Ricky Horton>employee or something like that to add in.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19114-2
<v Ricky Horton>so it's that's the easy one getting check
the power file.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19114-3
<v Ricky Horton>I never seen person's computer that's
where.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19176-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would be like Chris Pinium would be
something to have it you and then with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19176-1
<v Ricky Horton>Alan assisting he already has access to
the past that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19176-2
<v Ricky Horton>So to start there let's let's take this
route rebuild and we'll come back to the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19176-3
<v Ricky Horton>inspection.
We'll we'll take this route rebuild apply</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19176-4
<v Ricky Horton>to a piece and let's get out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19180-0
<v Ricky Horton>To go and say here's how we would process
and say these pieces have been painted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19180-1
<v Ricky Horton>These are the problems.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19181-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19193-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
your routes are probably going to go up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19193-1
<v Ricky Horton>by three or four of them probably, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19216-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that's shouldn't be a big deal
because the logic behind it is pretty</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19216-1
<v Ricky Horton>solid,
so it's not like you're going to have a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19216-2
<v Ricky Horton>lot of different.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19218-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tell him it took an hour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19220-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm a bit removed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19222-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19234-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now you're being only simple, you know,
like, come on, let's see this, it's, it's,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19234-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's not, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19245-0
<v Ricky Horton>That was something that's OK.
Does this track paint usage and paint</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19245-1
<v Ricky Horton>like how he knows how much to buy?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19283-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you can go to the estimate to figure
it out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19283-1
<v Ricky Horton>You can see the square fluid issue to to
figure it out,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19283-2
<v Ricky Horton>but it's not going to pop up and say you
need to buy this much of this paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19283-3
<v Ricky Horton>that paint, that paint. No,
it's not going to do that because the the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19283-4
<v Ricky Horton>estimate will give give you.
I do it today, Daniel.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19323-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do I do it?
If I can get split wood on redness,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19323-1
<v Ricky Horton>go off historicals potential. I mean,
you already have standards for grace,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19323-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
like for different types of things and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19323-3
<v Ricky Horton>depending on what standard of vignesses.
So it doesn't really help you to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19362-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I think most of it. I mean,
we can put in the parameters,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19362-1
<v Ricky Horton>but like let's say if we put in steel,
I don't know if you can build a database</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19362-2
<v Ricky Horton>with different paint products or we just
want to put in that standardize it if you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19362-3
<v Ricky Horton>had it in there, would it generate?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19365-0
<v Ricky Horton>Purchasing requests automatically.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19399-0
<v Ricky Horton>For paint cause it's it's technically not
filed to a specific paint like the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19399-1
<v Ricky Horton>estimate is.
The estimate will tell exactly with how</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19399-2
<v Ricky Horton>much of which paint that you need.
Production is is is just can you push the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19399-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimate?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19432-0
<v Ricky Horton>You you you can push a piece of in an
estimate of a person, but not the payment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19432-1
<v Ricky Horton>So he's key stroking it in. Yeah, yeah,
I'm trying to get him out of the key</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19432-2
<v Ricky Horton>stroking. Yeah, you got to put it in.
Well, somebody's got to put it in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19432-3
<v Ricky Horton>The question is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19435-0
<v Ricky Horton>Who puts it? Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19452-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whoever you choose.
So you got the surface area up there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19452-1
<v Ricky Horton>I can filter for anything and tell me
what my surface is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19455-0
<v Ricky Horton>This one I applied.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19460-0
<v Ricky Horton>the nearest symbol too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19465-0
<v Ricky Horton>Visibility here. Uh um QA QC.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19467-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are you going still?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19468-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I was missing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19494-0
<v Ricky Horton>How difficult is it going to be?
Let's just say from estimating that'd be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19494-1
<v Ricky Horton>really difficult.
I want to know how many square feet I did</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19494-2
<v Ricky Horton>per month and how much primer I used and
look at how much primer I've actually</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19494-3
<v Ricky Horton>bought.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19514-0
<v Ricky Horton>It should be difficult to get.
There's not going to be one report that I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19514-1
<v Ricky Horton>get print that says I'm OK with that,
but yeah, you can filter for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19515-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19516-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19556-0
<v Ricky Horton>As far as everything is broken down with
job numbers,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19556-1
<v Ricky Horton>you could never finish for all of the
project. Yeah, you you can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19556-2
<v Ricky Horton>You can run reports across projects here
and you can differ on just that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19556-3
<v Ricky Horton>particular finish if you want to do it
with you all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19560-0
<v Ricky Horton>Your love piece is over 25 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19573-0
<v Ricky Horton>From and it has a dash here,
so in production it goes to the middle at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19573-1
<v Ricky Horton>the top.
You can just type it in at the top.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19576-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can find.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19577-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19583-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's so hard.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19612-0
<v Ricky Horton>I sit here like that, period. Once it did,
it's actually direct character. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19612-1
<v Ricky Horton>I forgot I entered it in here this way,
but whenever I'm in the file system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19612-2
<v Ricky Horton>I have to I have to dash, I have to dash.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19616-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
they go one way and then they go another</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19616-1
<v Ricky Horton>and so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19639-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you're you're right.
And that's why the best you have to be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19639-1
<v Ricky Horton>back up and then in other viewers have
been more strong in a ways than</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19639-2
<v Ricky Horton>production tracking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19642-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's the personal flush.
Here's your.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19643-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's not available without suspensions
back with it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19644-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19659-0
<v Ricky Horton>They went, wait,
what if the priming guy wants to know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19659-1
<v Ricky Horton>what it is? He's not like his law.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19672-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's we supplied in the shop reports
that our service area personally.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19678-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here's how we can help you to process
this in the shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19718-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you're on this screen in the shop,
so you choose the station that you want</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19718-1
<v Ricky Horton>to do now.
Add is adding one piece at a time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19718-2
<v Ricky Horton>Add batch would be multiple pieces.
I just painted these 25 pieces so that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19718-3
<v Ricky Horton>add batch is typically what.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19724-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, guys out and pay for who we use it.
So let's hit that batch on print.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19735-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you Scroll down through there,
you're you're picking the ones that you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19735-1
<v Ricky Horton>did. I even did one of those.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19791-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go on down,
we can do more and I only find the route</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19791-1
<v Ricky Horton>to the one.
I only find the route to the one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19791-2
<v Ricky Horton>I got your question.
So it's all down the board. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19791-3
<v Ricky Horton>so but if you have multiple, so I'm just,
I'm just selecting the ones that I do all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19791-4
<v Ricky Horton>the way down through there and then I'll
hit update.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19795-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then it will, it will process that so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19796-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19797-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like to run.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19811-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we're not like it up too, so.
So by highlighting,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19811-1
<v Ricky Horton>like that's your bulk adding, routing too,
yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19812-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19813-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19820-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now if I go back, I have to refresh it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19823-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
Now we're going to have that to see</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19823-1
<v Ricky Horton>multiples.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19837-0
<v Ricky Horton>That should be more than what's in there
either, and we'll just get an update.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19861-0
<v Ricky Horton>So now I just updated it in the system.
If we go back,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19861-1
<v Ricky Horton>go back into the desktop and do
production status,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19861-2
<v Ricky Horton>we'll be able to see that that's been
done now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19869-0
<v Ricky Horton>Who else is working at this speed here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19870-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19913-0
<v Ricky Horton>You mean like in the technical interface?
Yeah, you're moving fast.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19913-1
<v Ricky Horton>Who else knows the budget?
So you you guys are the masters of this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19913-2
<v Ricky Horton>company. Yeah, see,
the prep has now been done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19913-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it's marked as done automatically.
So it's mild in the system of that one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19916-0
<v Ricky Horton>It isn't practice, but it doesn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19918-0
<v Ricky Horton>What was that screen again?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19962-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is just a thing I forgot to this one,
but you can see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19962-1
<v Ricky Horton>So from here this is what it's going to
look like on the tablet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19962-2
<v Ricky Horton>And so if we went back to production
tracking and we went to prime and all of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19962-3
<v Ricky Horton>these assemblies were completed in prime,
you would then come down.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19979-0
<v Ricky Horton>Got here. This one's complete.
This assembly's complete.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19979-1
<v Ricky Horton>This assembly's complete.
This assembly's complete.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/19979-2
<v Ricky Horton>We put it update.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20017-0
<v Ricky Horton>And this updates all these successfully
updated. I go back to my production.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20017-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is instantly updated.
Now on that screen it had hours and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20017-2
<v Ricky Horton>minutes that is that supposed to be the
time to complete that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20064-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can add in hours and so if it's if
it's a prep stage, however long,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20064-1
<v Ricky Horton>so you guys have that specific part,
you can handle and have that level of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20064-2
<v Ricky Horton>visibility.
You can do that with like our saw if we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20064-3
<v Ricky Horton>have if they're doing the cut station and
they have a cut list out there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20064-4
<v Ricky Horton>they'll cut it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20101-0
<v Ricky Horton>It took me 4 minutes to run this piece.
Took me 5 minutes. So if you start it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20101-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can get rid of the batch and it gets
started. That is, they start spraying it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20101-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm all done with it, comes back,
gets stopped and processes those pieces</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20101-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then it'll all be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20135-0
<v Ricky Horton>Steve, I mean, it'll,
it'll split it even like based on and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20135-1
<v Ricky Horton>that's what we want on the tab list.
So we don't track the time. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20135-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's like that. Yeah, I'd like to have,
you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20135-3
<v Ricky Horton>actually not how many square feet they
get in one hour. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20135-4
<v Ricky Horton>And what is part timers?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is for individual individuals. Yeah.
So how many,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-1
<v Ricky Horton>how many guys do you have putting
information into this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-2
<v Ricky Horton>All of our shoppers on the floor are
using this, this process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if every slaves are welder,
whatever step he does, he puts in this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-4
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but they're not using the start stop</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20189-5
<v Ricky Horton>button.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20229-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no,
pretty much going to be using the start</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20229-1
<v Ricky Horton>stop.
I think would be our detail department if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20229-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're at the saw just to kind of track
and see if if blades are running out or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20229-3
<v Ricky Horton>times are going high or if there's
trouble with the equipment,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20229-4
<v Ricky Horton>you know our times are going high.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20271-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's they kind of have an idea of what it
should take them and and then we can also</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20271-1
<v Ricky Horton>take that data and go, hey,
took us this long with W new 14 and took</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20271-2
<v Ricky Horton>us this long,
took W10 and you would kind of get some</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20271-3
<v Ricky Horton>of that data at least pulled back so that
we have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20310-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the way I see this for our guys is
they have a batch.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20310-1
<v Ricky Horton>Not gonna do time per piece. Yeah, no,
I don't. I don't blame you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20310-2
<v Ricky Horton>But high level, like if you have an iPad,
this is exactly what it would look like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20310-3
<v Ricky Horton>You can be here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20336-0
<v Ricky Horton>You hit start and then you would come
through and as your QC meetings and going</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20336-1
<v Ricky Horton>through your sections and go through and
you finally get everything done and you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20336-2
<v Ricky Horton>would update and stop your timer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20360-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then that's going to track your your
completion for everything things upon</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20360-1
<v Ricky Horton>when you when you figure your timer,
does it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20360-2
<v Ricky Horton>is it going to populate the hours or
minutes? Yes, you have to still have. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20360-3
<v Ricky Horton>it just didn't populate here because it
wasn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20387-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is there a way to set it so that at a
higher level where you have to use it to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20387-1
<v Ricky Horton>start and stuff? No,
there's not a there's not enough must on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20387-2
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20425-0
<v Ricky Horton>So do you guys have a meeting?
Do you have a meeting before you start</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20425-1
<v Ricky Horton>painting?
Do you have anything before you start</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20425-2
<v Ricky Horton>painting? Like, I mean,
he could be in your office talking to you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20425-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's starting.
He works 8 hours and he can finish it and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20425-4
<v Ricky Horton>he gets to stop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20454-0
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't doesn't work that simple.
We're not at the point where we need to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20454-1
<v Ricky Horton>have a painting outside.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20476-0
<v Ricky Horton>One,
because of the different material when we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20476-1
<v Ricky Horton>get close,
we'll be that we don't have enough space</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20476-2
<v Ricky Horton>to spread a lot of stuff out.
You get over sprayed,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20476-3
<v Ricky Horton>you get over sprayed,
you have all that kind of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20484-0
<v Ricky Horton>The other thing is painting goes much
quicker than anything else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20521-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean, as soon as you set the pot,
I mean you have to stay on top of it to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20521-1
<v Ricky Horton>not cook the paint and screw up your flip.
So if it takes them a full day to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20521-2
<v Ricky Horton>probably say a truckload of steel,
it'll think they got 3-4 hours, I think.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20545-0
<v Ricky Horton>Three or four different dogs in one day.
So he has not had at the ponds</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20545-1
<v Ricky Horton>essentially that he can keep cool in the
summer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20545-2
<v Ricky Horton>He can hit start stop every time he
changes a batch.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20579-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, well,
if it doesn't even have to be 3 buildings</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20579-1
<v Ricky Horton>and have to take time,
you know who painted which piece on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20579-2
<v Ricky Horton>Monday.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you don't have the amount of time for
that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you got that level of detail by doing
this. So if you want to set up stuff,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure you can have a set up stuff if
it takes an hour to set up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-3
<v Ricky Horton>It takes a man hour,
about an hour for two days to get the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-4
<v Ricky Horton>paint gather to mix it up.
I'm sure if you wanted that you can have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20627-5
<v Ricky Horton>a set up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20662-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you wanted to know how much time he
was painting versus how much time he was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20662-1
<v Ricky Horton>setting up to paint, you could segregate.
You you could in a sense.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20662-2
<v Ricky Horton>There is a time tracking function in here.
It's clunky outside of that sort spot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20662-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's a little clunky.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20696-0
<v Ricky Horton>That that we were doing is tied to a
station for a particular piece.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20696-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now if I'm doing,
if I'm going to set up like the paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20696-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's not tied to a specific piece that
said, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20696-3
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not going to process the piece of it,
that's what I'm lucky.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20728-0
<v Ricky Horton>So start stops is the only thing that
spreads the hours over the batch. Yes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20728-1
<v Ricky Horton>yes,
you gotta use start stop for spreading.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20728-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
it only depends on what you want to know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20728-3
<v Ricky Horton>here if you care about setup or not setup.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20733-0
<v Ricky Horton>Depends on what you want. So how can we?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20785-0
<v Ricky Horton>What was concerned was setting up the
patches. So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20785-1
<v Ricky Horton>do we want like setting up to record that
that sort basically.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20785-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just trying to think of the flow over
here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20785-3
<v Ricky Horton>So when you guys get a package you have
in sequence 3 about one, let's say August,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20785-4
<v Ricky Horton>you guys have done all that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20833-0
<v Ricky Horton>You stated you're not saying it's ready.
Shipping and receiving brings that whole</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20833-1
<v Ricky Horton>pack is out. We start prepping it.
So that batch is already recreated, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20833-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you should be able to go to the
technical. Say you want to pull out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20833-3
<v Ricky Horton>See this three hot blood and you'll have
all the pieces in there already.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20833-4
<v Ricky Horton>All the guys got to do is hit start on
there, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20864-0
<v Ricky Horton>They start prepping, they stop.
That's the time that's done, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20864-1
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's already pre-builded, right,
then we should be good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20864-2
<v Ricky Horton>But that's not stuff coming from you guys,
not stuff that's totally totally.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20864-3
<v Ricky Horton>So how do we approach that the same much?
I'll I'll go with this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20907-0
<v Ricky Horton>The main thing here,
like it's a similar setup.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20907-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just apply a different result here
because I made those those coatings the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20907-2
<v Ricky Horton>only ones.
Your guys out there really won't see the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20907-3
<v Ricky Horton>difference.
It's still will be on processing the prep</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20907-4
<v Ricky Horton>station,
on processing the private station.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20940-0
<v Ricky Horton>It really doesn't make any difference to
them when the risk carries only or by</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20940-1
<v Ricky Horton>then can you know? No,
I understand the step is the same,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20940-2
<v Ricky Horton>but the whole so when it comes from them,
they already have it built up for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20940-3
<v Ricky Horton>sequence for a lot of her package.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20945-0
<v Ricky Horton>When it comes to us, if I get a kiss file.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20992-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not necessarily going to get it
either by truck load, for example,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20992-1
<v Ricky Horton>by sequence or by load number.
I'm just going to get a policy,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20992-2
<v Ricky Horton>all the pieces in there and then I got to
break it out and sequence it out. Yes. OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20992-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's what's going to have to happen.
We're going to have to have someone we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/20992-4
<v Ricky Horton>would include that and then we'll just go
through and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-0
<v Ricky Horton>You would tell me, hey, I'm in fact,
you know this is gonna be each load and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-1
<v Ricky Horton>if we want to do loads of sequences and
blocks,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-2
<v Ricky Horton>then we would just do it for sequences.
Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-3
<v Ricky Horton>what about if they if they deliver the
what?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-4
<v Ricky Horton>What we do now is we just go in there and
select which one we want and place it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21039-5
<v Ricky Horton>into sequence a lot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21046-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can you pull up?
Can you pull up WWB 123092?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21082-0
<v Ricky Horton>Select. Yeah,
but that means the guy's got to walk</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21082-1
<v Ricky Horton>around and take the regular pieces and
put them in, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21082-2
<v Ricky Horton>So when you do it like,
let's say you're doing batches and you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21082-3
<v Ricky Horton>just doing chunks,
you're going to capture in that start and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21082-4
<v Ricky Horton>stop time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21128-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you were to do the whole batch start
and then you're you capture all you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21128-1
<v Ricky Horton>moving and handling all of this thing.
You know what I mean? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21128-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I hear a few things about some files.
So yeah, this, this is an example.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21128-3
<v Ricky Horton>This is a big job that was customer
supply. We got the case files from them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21171-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now,
do you see anything referring to like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21171-1
<v Ricky Horton>bone number regard of the ship? No,
I didn't see anything in the just just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21171-2
<v Ricky Horton>their specifics that they have.
How it shipped to you,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21171-3
<v Ricky Horton>is that what you're saying? Yeah,
I was shipping to us because so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-0
<v Ricky Horton>Reason I got this,
I got the spot and then one for square</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-1
<v Ricky Horton>footage too,
because there was a doc going on for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-2
<v Ricky Horton>about two years.
Our city and receiving guys were making</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-3
<v Ricky Horton>BOL's out of this,
so that helped us out a lot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-4
<v Ricky Horton>But when it was coming in,
I mean we could get truck loads,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-5
<v Ricky Horton>they would have mixed pieces.
Mainly it was space sequences,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21223-6
<v Ricky Horton>but you'd get the object that comes in
with one sequence.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21228-0
<v Ricky Horton>The good thing is they wanted it
delivered by sequence.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21278-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I'm just trying to put worst case
scenario,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21278-1
<v Ricky Horton>if I got a batch of files and there's no
organizational system to it, all right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21278-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can organize that.
So you can re-sequence it or you can put</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21278-3
<v Ricky Horton>a lot number on it in order to organize
it the way that you want.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21290-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can and and and unless you're on the
stats and you see it, but they do good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21290-1
<v Ricky Horton>I guess there's a lot of money you're on
up there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21290-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's some lots and some stuff maybe.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21338-0
<v Ricky Horton>The laws could correspond to what came on,
you know, in a particular truck.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21338-1
<v Ricky Horton>You could. I I personally,
if it were me and I had this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21338-2
<v Ricky Horton>I would take the main piece and push them
over to a PA before the trucks get here</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21338-3
<v Ricky Horton>and I would receive that I I'd do a $0.
00 PA.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21355-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then I would receive those pieces as
I get here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21355-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I would then have visibility here
what's received and what's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21355-2
<v Ricky Horton>You know what I'm saying?
Probably just like you buy it from.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21360-0
<v Ricky Horton>What nerves of Denver? What?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21387-0
<v Ricky Horton>You is your process that way that if you
receive something,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21387-1
<v Ricky Horton>you must have either a PO or a customer
PO, a $0.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21387-2
<v Ricky Horton>00 PO or can stuff come into this with no?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21390-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anything coming in should help.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21392-0
<v Ricky Horton>The.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21416-0
<v Ricky Horton>All those ******* schools coming in the
wire.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21416-1
<v Ricky Horton>You set everything on one BOL and then
it's in the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21435-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that is that's why I got it.
I have **** that's out my side.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21435-1
<v Ricky Horton>I picked up to bring over here to process
here instead of process on site.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21438-0
<v Ricky Horton>That doesn't have any paperwork or
anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21469-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you don't do it, in my mind,
somebody's going to say, well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21469-1
<v Ricky Horton>I sent it to you and you say no,
you didn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21469-2
<v Ricky Horton>You get into that argument and it's
really they need to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21469-3
<v Ricky Horton>Their BOL needs to be accurate.
We need to create a BOL of it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21469-4
<v Ricky Horton>They don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21502-0
<v Ricky Horton>That builder stuff,
that's just it's small. It's a small,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21502-1
<v Ricky Horton>but instead of last you get out of the
field,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21502-2
<v Ricky Horton>whatever incurred cost is over there,
we're just bringing it back in the shop,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21502-3
<v Ricky Horton>processing it here and taking it back to
center.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21504-0
<v Ricky Horton>Where you're sitting that regular stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21515-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's for, but yeah, we're doing it.
We'd rather do a do a shop and do it out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21551-0
<v Ricky Horton>But everything else, yeah, it comes in,
it has a BLL and it has to get to work</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21551-1
<v Ricky Horton>with.
Are are you wanting to re sequence or log</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21551-2
<v Ricky Horton>it just no matter what came in or is it
for for the user of the production</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21551-3
<v Ricky Horton>process?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21606-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, here we can do that.
We can just select whatever pieces it is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21606-1
<v Ricky Horton>pull it over,
put it in a new lot and then you're in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21606-2
<v Ricky Horton>the filter for that lot.
But like you could be in when you when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21606-3
<v Ricky Horton>you are, let's say for the print,
you can filter for lot 4 and just those</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21606-4
<v Ricky Horton>pieces show up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21643-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you're saying I'm processing this lot
4, so and this can be done on a glass.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21643-1
<v Ricky Horton>So let's say that it's all against the
truckload of steel and all over the road.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21643-2
<v Ricky Horton>You can go in there,
select the piece marks that are on that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21643-3
<v Ricky Horton>vehicle,
sign the bottom of the one floor and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21643-4
<v Ricky Horton>that's how we track the big production
process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21648-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, we just have to show him.
I've shown him a few times.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21686-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whenever this is special,
so very very simple process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21686-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is how we define most of our
production by priorities for different</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21686-2
<v Ricky Horton>areas in here.
Sometimes I have an area of work and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21686-3
<v Ricky Horton>priority.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21720-0
<v Ricky Horton>But then I go on the categories and you
can find me further in that category.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21720-1
<v Ricky Horton>So then I'll I'll even go into the
subcategories.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21720-2
<v Ricky Horton>So many different ways you can get your
data refined for once.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21748-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's kind of there's quite a bit you
can do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21748-1
<v Ricky Horton>Go back in there and in the go filter for
block one so we can move. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21748-2
<v Ricky Horton>let me do a file.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21749-0
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21752-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21758-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I was. No. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21771-0
<v Ricky Horton>A whole load for you. Jeez,
that makes you wonder,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21771-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll tell you right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21772-0
<v Ricky Horton>Free bleach.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21774-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, EPN go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21813-0
<v Ricky Horton>That was nice too.
So when you get a production tracking now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21813-1
<v Ricky Horton>go at the very top,
the upside down triangle in the upper</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21813-2
<v Ricky Horton>right and hit the work package there and
you'll get a seat block there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21857-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now when we're getting units,
we just build it for lock and lunder.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21857-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now when we get a print or something,
get a batch only didn't show up to lock</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21857-2
<v Ricky Horton>and stuff.
And so you can literally say start if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21857-3
<v Ricky Horton>you're building all that in print at the
same time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21893-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then there's actually a Max update,
but it's not when you say all that is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21893-1
<v Ricky Horton>done and then hit update. Yeah,
Max come over.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21893-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's kind of a cheater button, but yeah,
if they go through it and they get it all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21893-3
<v Ricky Horton>done, you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21925-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds good to me,
but you can at least leave this screen on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21925-1
<v Ricky Horton>when you're tablet while it's going
through. Now here's here's the picture.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21925-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now does it take into account,
for example,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21925-3
<v Ricky Horton>if I'm processing your play versus an ID?
Does it read that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21952-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to,
it's going to average that time and on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21952-1
<v Ricky Horton>the cross, it's going to have it.
It don't matter about processing the the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21952-2
<v Ricky Horton>gas being a small *** plate,
they both get the same allow for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21952-3
<v Ricky Horton>When you do it this way,
if you use the part timers and do it in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21952-4
<v Ricky Horton>the 70 cases, then it got start and stop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21979-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
just just give you an average across</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21979-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything.
So but if I leave this at a minute,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21979-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to take a minute and now
there's so many parts in this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21979-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you can hit stop and they just fail.
They're going for the hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21985-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sewer says IRS.
You could manual the Internet. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21985-1
<v Ricky Horton>you could.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/21995-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you maybe if you hit reset down there
and yeah, now you can do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22028-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do I know that you did that? No. When?
When we go to see, when we go to see,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22028-1
<v Ricky Horton>whether I'll be a Sarge file or whether
I'll be able to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22029-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22057-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I agree with you. I don't like.
I don't like the mirroring because if I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22057-1
<v Ricky Horton>took nine hours to do something,
it should take two hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22057-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not putting 9 hours. Well,
I don't lock. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22057-3
<v Ricky Horton>to my university time blocks,
manual time adjustments are long.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22075-0
<v Ricky Horton>Matter. Yeah.
This is where they did all the loads.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22075-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can see all the loads in their jobs,
marketing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22090-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if I if I got this job in and got it
in the system and I wanted to ship it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22090-1
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22136-0
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't want to do any any of this stuff
in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22136-1
<v Ricky Horton>Can I still ship it or will it prevent me
from creating a shipping document? Yes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22136-2
<v Ricky Horton>you still have to have pieces in there
shipped, but yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22136-3
<v Ricky Horton>you can do it with that. OK,
without moving against it. Oh good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22136-4
<v Ricky Horton>So the system I'm used to is if you don't
complete service.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22173-0
<v Ricky Horton>Steps.
It is not ready to ship and you can't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22173-1
<v Ricky Horton>ship it. No,
this will allowing ship regard.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22173-2
<v Ricky Horton>So there's now that's in 2046.
That's a new one we've featured where</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22173-3
<v Ricky Horton>production has to finish before it's
going to be an option.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22184-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what you're really saying is they're
moving to more of these more locked down</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22184-1
<v Ricky Horton>systems. We want to have some,
I mean that's more clear meters and so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22184-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22213-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, we have potatoes,
so they either have a potato or a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22213-1
<v Ricky Horton>sandwich. There's the first here. Yeah,
potato. Yeah, the softening.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22213-2
<v Ricky Horton>And there's peppers.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22214-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22229-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, it's not. It's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22234-0
<v Ricky Horton>On that, yeah, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22238-0
<v Ricky Horton>I actually can do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22239-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was inside.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22245-0
<v Ricky Horton>This works.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22255-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22259-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's nothing to go about,
but then you know to the package right</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22259-1
<v Ricky Horton>here, I think.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22261-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, right there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22267-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22279-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anybody want water? I got water. I'm good.
Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22286-0
<v Ricky Horton>Part of the matter.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22288-0
<v Ricky Horton>White.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22289-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think they're on their own.
There's some.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22290-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22318-0
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody else want the barbecue sauce,
Lauren. Open it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22318-1
<v Ricky Horton>I won't sign no problem.
They're different, so you can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22322-0
<v Ricky Horton>Grab this with your toss.
That's the that's the not spiky,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22322-1
<v Ricky Horton>not as spiky, but still, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22337-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's all day I actually need.
What do they go over there for one day</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22337-1
<v Ricky Horton>off, one day off or two day off? 3. Yikes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22342-0
<v Ricky Horton>About the people.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22343-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22350-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll probably work on it.
It's about three here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22350-1
<v Ricky Horton>What are you going to be talking about?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22353-0
<v Ricky Horton>What a painful.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22370-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I think it's like what is the problem
we want that Cory came over.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22370-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what do you think?
You're the best staff to the W7 the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22370-2
<v Ricky Horton>bigger ones, I thought we'd say.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22389-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're on the break.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22393-0
<v Ricky Horton>12, 2018.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22407-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you got to have one piece of equipment,
what would it be? How much work?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22410-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22418-0
<v Ricky Horton>The one that's not inspection,
it's a regular one. Yeah, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22425-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the coach will start with and does</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22425-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22446-0
<v Ricky Horton>It needs to be in line.
That'll be with the other restriction we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22446-1
<v Ricky Horton>run into goes to about 36 inches.
Recently stopped about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22458-0
<v Ricky Horton>Breakover point for like a Python. Yeah,
they are in the Python test.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22462-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's it do? What's so that again?
The pilot system? Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22487-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'd be your all-in-one.
It would do everything,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22487-1
<v Ricky Horton>but then at some point it comes to
bottleneck.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22487-2
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to be cutting and drilling
and coping at the same time?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22491-0
<v Ricky Horton>If it's me, I would be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22517-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'd look at like if I'm starting with
something like that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22517-1
<v Ricky Horton>I would do a Bortman or something because
then I could get a drill or and a saw</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22517-2
<v Ricky Horton>later and put it in the same system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22536-0
<v Ricky Horton>Python has no they don't have any drill
or saw,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22536-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I couldn't tie anything into it.
It would be one system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22545-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, like what we sent out to.
They usually have a.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22564-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just because I got KC Jennings represents
the case.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22564-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to place it showing up in his
Gucci shoes in the shorts.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22566-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unbounce.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22571-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's still bad as a video there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22583-0
<v Ricky Horton>They had someone for us to reach you.
They're tackled though, but there it is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22584-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22594-0
<v Ricky Horton>Still haven't finished though the old
bell.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22605-0
<v Ricky Horton>I just put their we're gonna be selling
some new work for this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22606-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22609-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's moving any of your.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22630-0
<v Ricky Horton>In their own slaw,
they put wheat in their ******* coleslaw,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22630-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know, coleslaw,
green corn and all that. They add.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22632-0
<v Ricky Horton>You only should have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22633-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22640-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the sovereign.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22659-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want to be and so yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's good and free here. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22659-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can do it. Just like I said,
wouldn't want you to be part of this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22679-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think they also do that.
I don't believe they just one or or as</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22679-1
<v Ricky Horton>well avoid like that.
There's probably cross, yeah, a lot of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22686-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they're like,
who's Bobby and you're supporting,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22686-1
<v Ricky Horton>like adding more to gasoline type of
things thing, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22687-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mhm.</v>

<v Ricky Horton>Thank you very much.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/22713-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23514-0
<v Ricky Horton>He's probably not receiving anything from
our end.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23514-1
<v Ricky Horton>Now you're supposed to get something. Yes,
I can give it to us in fact. Right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23514-2
<v Ricky Horton>There are good reviews. More than others.
All you're reviewing, you'll find out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23538-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, maybe something,
but have a little adjourned because we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23538-1
<v Ricky Horton>got that. It's been our portal,
but that is, that's legit. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23538-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's legit. Yeah,
I think you sent it in and said it was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23538-3
<v Ricky Horton>fishing. Yeah, it's not fishing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23572-0
<v Ricky Horton>She sent the e-mail and said this is
actually we didn't get an e-mail. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23572-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just got no, I got that. No,
you didn't get an e-mail. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23572-2
<v Ricky Horton>she sent out an e-mail.
I said expect to receive an e-mail from</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23572-3
<v Ricky Horton>this website here to set up your account.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23586-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, maybe I just look on my phone.
My phone keeps grouping up and now it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23596-0
<v Ricky Horton>We use the restroom. I'm all finished up,
so for a meeting once I get back,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23596-1
<v Ricky Horton>be good to go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23597-0
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23601-0
<v Ricky Horton>Anything about Rose?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23606-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23627-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which projects are you going to help
manage?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23627-1
<v Ricky Horton>They told me they were going to help me
work with the other guys for now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23627-2
<v Ricky Horton>maybe 2-3 months to give me specific ones.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23628-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23650-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do you like to run multi-trade or do
you care?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23650-1
<v Ricky Horton>I mainly structure on this lanes.
I don't do other trades,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23650-2
<v Ricky Horton>not very knowledgeable about electrical
or much of anything else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23650-3
<v Ricky Horton>My whole industry's been the best.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23657-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so they are specifically for mouth.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23666-0
<v Ricky Horton>I said I will coordinate those people to
the same time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23675-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you know how percentage low row Rex
versus bills and Rex?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23702-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I can do any of them. I mean,
it doesn't matter. I've done it both.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23702-1
<v Ricky Horton>When I was at Sheffield,
they buy out everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23702-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they would buy out fabrication that
advantage it, buy out direction,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23702-3
<v Ricky Horton>that means that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23732-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I did the same thing in when I was in
California for for Bragg and rigging.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23732-1
<v Ricky Horton>They didn't do any fabrication,
but they did all their own direction.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23732-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I would try out fabrication there and
sell it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23784-0
<v Ricky Horton>So why does the crane company do steel
rection? I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23784-1
<v Ricky Horton>I always thought it was kind of a
conflict of interest, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23784-2
<v Ricky Horton>Because they were renting out cranes.
They had three different businesses.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23784-3
<v Ricky Horton>They had a crane rental business,
obviously,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23784-4
<v Ricky Horton>which is basically why they had a heavy
haul business.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23799-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then they had their, yeah,
now I might and when you come visit when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23799-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm waiting,
but it was really just installation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23824-0
<v Ricky Horton>Can I have a problem with those guys who
want to let you see? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23824-1
<v Ricky Horton>mostly to every hall,
because that's your people using this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23824-2
<v Ricky Horton>So when I was at Bragman Rigging,
I became the construction manager.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23872-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I was when I left.
And the only reason I left was because my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23872-1
<v Ricky Horton>kids and grandkids moved to here.
So I told them when I get a job there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23872-2
<v Ricky Horton>do what I do and I'll consider moving
because they were bugging me, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23872-3
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm sure that makes sense.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23903-0
<v Ricky Horton>Handler. Yeah, one in Scottsdale.
So they would ask every patient that came</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23903-1
<v Ricky Horton>in,
even if they were looking for somebody in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23903-2
<v Ricky Horton>instructional steel industry, you know,
then somebody would shelf steel the game</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23903-3
<v Ricky Horton>and search them that and, Oh yeah,
we're looking for somebody just like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23903-4
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23907-0
<v Ricky Horton>2-3 months later, that's where it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23945-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think Shelf's also changed a lot since
they got. But TDM Global here technically,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23945-1
<v Ricky Horton>yeah, yeah,
TDM Global's bought so many other</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23945-2
<v Ricky Horton>companies and find them with Shell,
you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23945-3
<v Ricky Horton>like the division I was with with
Sheffield Management that became.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23982-0
<v Ricky Horton>Gray Wolf. So it's now Gray Wolf.
It's just by the name of Gray Wolf.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23982-1
<v Ricky Horton>I wasn't really a lot of that purchase.
The Gray Wolf wasn't doing very well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23982-2
<v Ricky Horton>and so that's why they wanted them so
cheap.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/23982-3
<v Ricky Horton>They underbid a bunch of big *** jobs and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24014-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm the project manager that usually gets
the most difficult or hardest jobs to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24014-1
<v Ricky Horton>and so they plot them out and next thing
you know I got $30 million job I got to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24014-2
<v Ricky Horton>have done in like 6 months and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24026-0
<v Ricky Horton>I look at a bid and I'm going back and
get way over bid this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24026-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think we're expecting to lose 3 or 4
million.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24051-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can't turn it around,
change order to death. We broke even.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24051-1
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe made a few bucks,
but it was difficult. Where was that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24051-2
<v Ricky Horton>That was in Texas. It's Steel Dynamics.
The they're a mill in Texas.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24065-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's it.
How long goes about we did my create?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24065-1
<v Ricky Horton>Probably four years ago.
You don't got any Tom Schuler? No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24065-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24067-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're trying to chat.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24087-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I think a couple of those guys are
now ended up at Gray with one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24087-1
<v Ricky Horton>They were working for Chattanooga.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24108-0
<v Ricky Horton>To finish that job,
I went to Salt Lake for a year and a half</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24108-1
<v Ricky Horton>and another $30 million worth of 6
projects all on the same site for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24108-2
<v Ricky Horton>West Valley Prison.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24151-0
<v Ricky Horton>So they built that and they had another
project manager assigned while I was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24151-1
<v Ricky Horton>doing that steel dynamics job.
That guy was screwing everything up and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24151-2
<v Ricky Horton>wouldn't return phone calls for like a
week.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24151-3
<v Ricky Horton>And so they were ready to throw us out
the job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24151-4
<v Ricky Horton>So sitting recognition steel dynamics,
Tom, do you want me to go now about?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24189-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I did like 2 weeks later,
the other PM that was sounding, he quit.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24189-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think he knew he was probably going to
be fired.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24189-2
<v Ricky Horton>But so I got all these screaming guys at
me for a year and a half.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24189-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I actually went there Monday through
Thursday every week. I was in Salt Lake.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24193-0
<v Ricky Horton>For you to have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24210-0
<v Ricky Horton>My friend lives in Scott Logan.
Is that right? Which is nice.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24218-0
<v Ricky Horton>My daughter's in.
She's probably six months ago.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24247-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
it might be the focus on free contact.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24247-1
<v Ricky Horton>One day we'll have to work with
guesstimators. We'll get a phone.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24247-2
<v Ricky Horton>We haven't even met them yet.
And is that during the interviews?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24247-3
<v Ricky Horton>Nothing. I've only been there a week.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24294-0
<v Ricky Horton>Went to two days of training and then on
the last last day of the last week</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24294-1
<v Ricky Horton>basically got my office set up,
spent a couple days getting blue beam up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24294-2
<v Ricky Horton>to date because I have surgeons anytime I
like to blue beam for like to do my own</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24294-3
<v Ricky Horton>takeoffs and stuff.
So that took me a day and a half and then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24324-0
<v Ricky Horton>I started doing a take off for that
Bechtel thing and then I'm here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24324-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm finished the take off through the
one. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24324-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was just going to do a portion of the
three hyperaction, whatever.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24324-3
<v Ricky Horton>They're not real hyperaction,
they're just structural steel, I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24338-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like I say, I haven't met anybody yet.
Talk to them on the phone one time or a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24338-1
<v Ricky Horton>couple times for a meeting.
We had all that meeting THC for like 1</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24338-2
<v Ricky Horton>minutes. That's it. Have you other team?
Right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24364-0
<v Ricky Horton>So currently at this moment we have these
routes defined in here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24364-1
<v Ricky Horton>We don't have inspections tied to them.
This would be a question from all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24400-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you like the way that that was set up
for your tracking?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24400-1
<v Ricky Horton>You guys are going to continue to do
follow inspections in site docs or do we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24400-2
<v Ricky Horton>want to time an inspection to each one of
these? We do that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24400-3
<v Ricky Horton>then they're going to have to go.
I don't want to time inspection because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24400-4
<v Ricky Horton>right now I don't have a dedicated QC
person.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24433-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is this what at least involving in
percentages and tracking?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24433-1
<v Ricky Horton>Give you some time,
some realistic times for what it takes to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24433-2
<v Ricky Horton>get the process done without associating
an inspection to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24433-3
<v Ricky Horton>Then marking a completed APM bill will
give you that activation of the process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24482-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just not going to have the reports.
If if I go to any of our previous</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24482-1
<v Ricky Horton>production jobs,
I can go in there and select the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24482-2
<v Ricky Horton>associated assemblies and pull the
collection resorts,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24482-3
<v Ricky Horton>which gives me the QC that inspected it
and then the reports.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24482-4
<v Ricky Horton>Some of my customers have asked for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24513-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is moving forward.
We can do per assembly, not per assembly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24513-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can't just do the department assembly
or we can, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24513-2
<v Ricky Horton>we can build that inspection that is not
tied to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24542-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll send you guys all the old one, see.
I'm trying to get in a site box anyway</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24542-1
<v Ricky Horton>like that. That's our job.
It's gonna build one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24542-2
<v Ricky Horton>I haven't been since you're going to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24573-0
<v Ricky Horton>See,
I have to see that it's not a specific</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24573-1
<v Ricky Horton>piece. You have to make pieces for it.
She can build or it's not a piece.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24573-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you want to do your environmentals
and all that stuff, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24592-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
let's let's just do a fresh move so that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24592-1
<v Ricky Horton>we've got it. In that in that report,
you should say that the system crashed</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24592-2
<v Ricky Horton>for an hour. It has been doing.
I've got some big cabins.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24647-0
<v Ricky Horton>So to do the to do the doc,
the document that is currently on site</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24647-1
<v Ricky Horton>docs that is not tied to a piece like
your environmentals and stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24647-2
<v Ricky Horton>We'll be able to run one real quick so
you can see how it function and you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24647-3
<v Ricky Horton>decide what you want to do if you're
trying to run a site doc.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24657-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can see now how it works here.
It's an option. Yeah, that works for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24657-1
<v Ricky Horton>Um, hit that drop down for test night.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24703-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you know we could just change it to
environment or whatever.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24703-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know we can we can build whatever we
want here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24703-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's that is just hit that one more hit
that one more time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24703-3
<v Ricky Horton>Those right there the only ones that need
assembly part and load go back into the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24703-4
<v Ricky Horton>job and you have to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24750-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whereas everything else in the category,
rich building form is all we're doing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24750-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's just a category that you hit.
So you could do another page,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24750-2
<v Ricky Horton>you could do another environmental,
we can build,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24750-3
<v Ricky Horton>we can do whatever category you want.
Finance is to do it under the page.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24765-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and then yeah,
you could add multiples under under the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24765-1
<v Ricky Horton>paint designation really. What?
What do you want to be?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24765-2
<v Ricky Horton>What do you want to be?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24770-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, what's what's on somebody's?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24796-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you know,
I guess I can try and regulate at least</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24796-1
<v Ricky Horton>the the topics that it covers and see how
we can associate the test fields with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24796-2
<v Ricky Horton>what the data currently.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24797-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24821-0
<v Ricky Horton>That we can build these in it,
even if the artist building for one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24821-1
<v Ricky Horton>requirement is some field somewhere has
to have the ability to fail,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24821-2
<v Ricky Horton>but that's one of the requirement here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24829-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
actually we do a surface preference for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24829-1
<v Ricky Horton>it, but we're gonna need him that as just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24839-0
<v Ricky Horton>Method and I guess profile if it's
splashed.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cool.
So now we're just building the fuel cell</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-1
<v Ricky Horton>here that we want.
You're going to get date,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to get who's doing it anyway.
That's just part of the fence.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're we'll build everything. Well,
you got who, when it happened, what date,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-4
<v Ricky Horton>who did it and what area you see like
there's a there's a location you have to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24881-5
<v Ricky Horton>fill out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24883-0
<v Ricky Horton>Other than that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24907-0
<v Ricky Horton>For you to build the fields.
So what what do you want as first field?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24907-1
<v Ricky Horton>What would you say your mission? Method,
method or standard?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24907-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let's put standard that is SP2 three.
Do you want a nice drop down with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24907-3
<v Ricky Horton>different options?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24960-0
<v Ricky Horton>Unnecessarily, no. So do we have to?
Can it be free? You see there's tabs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24960-1
<v Ricky Horton>Bully is a checkbox.
So we can build a checkbox.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24960-2
<v Ricky Horton>Numeric is a number, date.
Text is a phrase. Memo is a paragraph.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24973-0
<v Ricky Horton>You want and then drop that.
We can build a custom drop. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/24973-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think it'll just be test SP2 or SP10 or
whatever.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25017-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just call out the standard.
So I'm not going to do this test since</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25017-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's just SP2 or something. Yeah,
why sometimes like I'm galvanizing stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25017-2
<v Ricky Horton>So instead of the galvanizing,
if it's been weather six months or more,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25017-3
<v Ricky Horton>all you have to do is an SP block.
If it's less than six months.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25057-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can pass it and then that's the one
or you can so it can be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25057-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's why I just want a brief so the guy
can just type in whatever he did.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25057-2
<v Ricky Horton>So is it always in the SP4SP3? Yeah,
it's always going to be in this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25094-0
<v Ricky Horton>SP1 one I might put SP-1,
one I might S1 and if you want to get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25094-1
<v Ricky Horton>start working with the data and trying to
build it for some of this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25094-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's going to make it very difficult to
open it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25094-3
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe because it can drop in two weeks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25099-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we just have on standard. Yeah,
who we didn't drop down.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25148-0
<v Ricky Horton>They get rid of the pair and drop down
there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25148-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you're just going to get a new option
and then put in the SP factors here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25148-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now we could do the SP one as we do put
all the SP factors.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25148-3
<v Ricky Horton>We see that we're still options up there.
We could uncheck that and you I could</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25148-4
<v Ricky Horton>pick one of those that makes sense.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25149-0
<v Ricky Horton>We kind of updated it too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25154-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm on these things here, son.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25156-0
<v Ricky Horton>Easy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25161-0
<v Ricky Horton>10 and then for 13.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25172-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is Rashad,
I want to make security so I can't read</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25172-1
<v Ricky Horton>that thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25183-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just be in there. We can you want to.
You want to turn it off so you can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25196-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say that again. You want it? We go.
You want it to turn it off so you can't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25196-1
<v Ricky Horton>have this work? Yeah, whatever you want.
OK, cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25239-0
<v Ricky Horton>What else? What in the field do you want?
We don't need to worry about job number</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25239-1
<v Ricky Horton>or anything like that, right?
That'll be associated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25239-2
<v Ricky Horton>You'll be associated. Yeah,
a job number that's in the system. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25239-3
<v Ricky Horton>this this type of test is not going back
to your job to do anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25239-4
<v Ricky Horton>So it is for a particular job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25243-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, right. Then put in, yeah,
put in the job number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25248-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just texted on that and we'll be open.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25279-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you guys have forms for each step,
whereas see paint forms for preps here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25279-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have a prep and paint application for
prep and paint form and then we have a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25279-2
<v Ricky Horton>code SQC form.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25307-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wait, what's easier?
Is it easier to put multiple things on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25307-1
<v Ricky Horton>one form with different sections?
Or is it one per? What's more efficient?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25307-2
<v Ricky Horton>What do you want me to do?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25345-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can like require certain fields to be
filled. If you have, if you're doing them,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25345-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you have a record where you have a
prep session and your paint session in it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25345-2
<v Ricky Horton>you have to have a ball unlocked where
you can leave it empty and not respond to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25345-3
<v Ricky Horton>it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25391-0
<v Ricky Horton>People just get complicit with that.
They'll start filling in just doing it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25391-1
<v Ricky Horton>quick.
Think of these as you're building one for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25391-2
<v Ricky Horton>each point in time.
So if it's like like some people want to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25391-3
<v Ricky Horton>build a QC test where I have one traveler
basically says I I did a fit check,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25391-4
<v Ricky Horton>I did a well check,
I did the final final check.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25427-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they want, they want one for them.
That won't work for this because like I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25427-1
<v Ricky Horton>wanted to submit it for fit because I
want to fail it. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25427-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's required me to do weld and paint as
well. I don't want to do that. I need it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25427-3
<v Ricky Horton>I need a second pace for each each one
time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25433-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you got a job number in there? Yeah,
we got, we got a job number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25442-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I think that I mean we can add profile</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25442-1
<v Ricky Horton>for blasted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25453-0
<v Ricky Horton>But leave that unlocked where he can.
He can leave it on field because they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25453-1
<v Ricky Horton>getting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25459-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're doing a.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25460-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25475-0
<v Ricky Horton>What else do you want?
I think that's simple.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25475-1
<v Ricky Horton>You want like a notes field or something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25479-0
<v Ricky Horton>All that. Yeah. Is that in this month?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25491-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or do you ever you work?
We're gonna hold back on what's not to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25491-1
<v Ricky Horton>paint, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25529-0
<v Ricky Horton>We don't.
We don't worry about that on report.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25529-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we get our guys, get the drawings,
they look out and we pull backs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25529-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm going to build the option. That's it.
But in terms of production, it's not,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25529-3
<v Ricky Horton>it's not better than.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25530-0
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25552-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's not before, I guess.
We factor in when we bid,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25552-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we figure out what we want to be
there. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25552-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't feel that has the ability to fail.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25565-0
<v Ricky Horton>You have to do it on the system because
that text and memory can't fail.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25614-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we should be able to fill out if he's
if he's required to get an SP1 and he did</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25614-1
<v Ricky Horton>it. That's that's a bill right there.
I mean SP 135133 are single.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25614-2
<v Ricky Horton>So why don't we leave?
It's supposed to be an SP1, let's say.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25625-0
<v Ricky Horton>But then there's a lot of people says,
yeah, pastor bid, but significant.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25651-0
<v Ricky Horton>It is these points, for example,
when they're required to blast an SP6 or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25651-1
<v Ricky Horton>an SP10,
if that pass the SP6 to everywhere,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25651-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
you'll have some shadowing or some, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25651-3
<v Ricky Horton>some stuff for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25652-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25665-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're already one of these set up for
all the types of blasting for that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25665-1
<v Ricky Horton>separation,
but is that not if you want to? There's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25711-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're involved.
So there's probably a record for everyone.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25711-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have everything.
So I just wanted we're doing all this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25711-2
<v Ricky Horton>trouble and track specifically codings
when we do this same type of thing or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25711-3
<v Ricky Horton>blasting as well. Well,
that's that's how we generalize the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25711-4
<v Ricky Horton>service, but whether it's supplies or.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25756-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you put it down as prep, period. Yeah,
you got it. OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25756-1
<v Ricky Horton>And then in prep I can say,
is it a pressure wash? Is it a power tool?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25756-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is it acetone wiper? Yeah, it's a sandbox.
Yeah. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25756-3
<v Ricky Horton>will then be on the tablet or the desktop
tablet?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25756-4
<v Ricky Horton>Let's grab the tablet and we'll see what
it would look like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25775-0
<v Ricky Horton>For this,
just click on tech power at the top and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25775-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can get back out of the what do I
have to do it in the job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25775-2
<v Ricky Horton>Just get general inspections there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25779-0
<v Ricky Horton>I.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25784-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is on SP3.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25798-0
<v Ricky Horton>So profile I won't be because there's no
profile required on the speed read.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25827-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you have to fill it in.
You can't dig a blank. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25827-1
<v Ricky Horton>you can definitely whether it's whether
it's optional or not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25827-2
<v Ricky Horton>So let's get that profile thing optional.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25863-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's been on those. Yeah.
See the attach that I had filed to get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25863-1
<v Ricky Horton>that on the tabs.
It's generally no say you want to make a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25863-2
<v Ricky Horton>picture. You want to grab the picture.
I can fill this out and then just take</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25863-3
<v Ricky Horton>pictures of one thing instead if you want
anything. Yep. Thank you both.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25864-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hmm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25869-0
<v Ricky Horton>You just want to do is you click in the
text file.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25870-0
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25876-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually protection add files.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25879-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25932-0
<v Ricky Horton>This database must get huge when you
start throwing pictures. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25932-1
<v Ricky Horton>the pictures technically don't get saved
in the database.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25932-2
<v Ricky Horton>It it has what's called document index
and so you can attach it is the document</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25932-3
<v Ricky Horton>index is just followed on your server.
So take it and it'll put it there and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25932-4
<v Ricky Horton>then the test actually just has a link to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25953-0
<v Ricky Horton>To where it would.
So the database doesn't really hold the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25953-1
<v Ricky Horton>the pictures, it's just the links.
So that's a I used it for about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25996-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know 8-9 years,
close to 10 years and didn't really move</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25996-1
<v Ricky Horton>anything out of it.
And I think about that that's where one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25996-2
<v Ricky Horton>of the half gigs. So wasn't messing.
And how do you know if without this form</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25996-3
<v Ricky Horton>of the lake,
which pictures were for what job?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/25996-4
<v Ricky Horton>It gives it some kind of naming.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26026-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it it, it stores it in.
It has a forward system that it uses.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26026-1
<v Ricky Horton>It creates it. Yeah, yeah,
it it manages it for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26026-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you really don't have to be able to
back them and pull anything. It doesn't,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26026-3
<v Ricky Horton>so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26027-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26029-0
<v Ricky Horton>Nothing more today.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26031-0
<v Ricky Horton>It established. It doesn't work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26038-0
<v Ricky Horton>Looks like there's another problem that
is looking for somewhere, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26040-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to have do you hit the the IF
files over here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26041-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26046-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I'm really freaking out on you guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26050-0
<v Ricky Horton>Any one value there?
I think it's something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26051-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26052-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hi Google.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26054-0
<v Ricky Horton>Stop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26055-0
<v Ricky Horton>She.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26062-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what I said.
So we can turn that off, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26072-0
<v Ricky Horton>You'd have to probably leave it first,
but yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26086-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do you get the form to capture the
loan growth memo header and all that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26086-1
<v Ricky Horton>Just go ahead. Oh,
you're going to hear me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26091-0
<v Ricky Horton>How did you say what over there?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26093-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no, I didn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26095-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26137-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you failed it then you can run a
follow up to it if you want to and you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26137-1
<v Ricky Horton>can have like I I used to say that where
if if it failed like there was a I was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26137-2
<v Ricky Horton>getting 0 NCRS in the shot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-0
<v Ricky Horton>That ****** me off.
And so I would require that that when the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-1
<v Ricky Horton>inspector failed anything,
whether it was a piece,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-2
<v Ricky Horton>whether it was something else,
then there were some fields he had to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-3
<v Ricky Horton>fill out.
They were basically not the mortgage</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-4
<v Ricky Horton>fields and they had to fill his house.
So you couldn't build stuff like that and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26192-5
<v Ricky Horton>then on the follow up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26212-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then there were certain other fields they
had to fill out. OK, well, what happened?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26212-1
<v Ricky Horton>What'd you do to resolve it? I just.
So there's all kinds of stuff like that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26212-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can build into these forms if you
want to, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26236-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we got put a few different ones in here</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26236-1
<v Ricky Horton>and then we got welding machine
inspection.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26236-2
<v Ricky Horton>We got to work with inspections, uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26240-0
<v Ricky Horton>But all these are associated are.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26285-0
<v Ricky Horton>You could, yeah,
you could then like I used to get it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26285-1
<v Ricky Horton>You set these up to send your reporting
on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26285-2
<v Ricky Horton>So like I used to get reporting that
would anything if they want to have a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26285-3
<v Ricky Horton>report need helping at the end of the day.
So I had a for for another so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26300-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you can set those up.
I'm going to that thing inspection.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26300-1
<v Ricky Horton>What was it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26359-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's good. Apply filter.
So hit the Sheffield's over here on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26359-1
<v Ricky Horton>left, the check box over here on the left.
That should all the fields.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26359-2
<v Ricky Horton>So a lot of times when it came down to,
I'm I'm looking for trains and what not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26359-3
<v Ricky Horton>I would just get the data here dumped out
in Excel and then I start pivoting some</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26359-4
<v Ricky Horton>bar graphs and all this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26381-0
<v Ricky Horton>As to see if I'm getting any issues or
whatnot, but if you go to the top,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26381-1
<v Ricky Horton>just go to just so we can see reports and
then you can get the just do the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26381-2
<v Ricky Horton>inspection test or everything. It's cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26386-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if you needed to just e-mail us out,
maybe not in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26393-0
<v Ricky Horton>And let's go on on my system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26412-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the big time.
This is the only kind of guy who clicks</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26412-1
<v Ricky Horton>and I know exactly where to click before
the next screen rolls.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26429-0
<v Ricky Horton>**** really messes that up.
I'm sitting there clicking in the area I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26429-1
<v Ricky Horton>shouldn't and then I finally loads and
then I'm clicking to something else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26470-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but if we think it's up to Trimble,
it's or they'll let me add job sites.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26470-1
<v Ricky Horton>Every time I try and add a job site,
as soon as I click save,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26470-2
<v Ricky Horton>whole program should come.
Couldn't get a job site address to show</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26470-3
<v Ricky Horton>up on my road list to save my life.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26510-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're every workaround they're trying to
do it and not get it to save in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26510-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I don't want it to revive, not revive.
You know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26510-2
<v Ricky Horton>it was on the service pack three. Yeah.
And so then they were like, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26510-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know, go to service pack five,
that'll probably fix it and then we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26510-4
<v Ricky Horton>switch to I instead, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26537-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I can. I can't.
It's not asking a close down. You know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26537-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just keep having these reoccurring
issues of of the system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26537-2
<v Ricky Horton>giving you the spinning of that.
And then you're wondering,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26537-3
<v Ricky Horton>can you guys go back?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26580-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we've got a number of versions.
The reason they wanted to go through this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26580-1
<v Ricky Horton>version is so that we can preplan future
production is this 2025 pie has the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26580-2
<v Ricky Horton>ability to because we currently have the
production planner for active production</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26580-3
<v Ricky Horton>jobs.
This portion has the ability to forecast</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26580-4
<v Ricky Horton>future work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26618-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which is kind of what we want to get into
this and we know we got this many hours</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26618-1
<v Ricky Horton>coming up.
Usually we can't go back because all the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26618-2
<v Ricky Horton>data that's gone in there since you
updated is in the new table format.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26618-3
<v Ricky Horton>And so trying to get that backwards,
you kind of lose all that so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26620-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26632-0
<v Ricky Horton>So depending on how long you have your
update on how much you're going to use.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26641-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I'm sure it has to go back to the
exact date,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26641-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it was the region's favors.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26652-0
<v Ricky Horton>But when it's warm,
I don't see this anywhere else. You know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26652-1
<v Ricky Horton>I have to think your environment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26670-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't care if I see the bad or not so,
but if it was worth that help.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26698-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would say this is how the issues and
every time it doesn't a second on TD</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26698-1
<v Ricky Horton>restarts and we go get back to normal.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26698-2
<v Ricky Horton>they should probably get somebody looking
into our system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26701-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26732-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can.
There's a there's a way to submit a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26732-1
<v Ricky Horton>ticket from in here.
It gets all the long files in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26732-2
<v Ricky Horton>background at the end of the backup,
sitting into them if you want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26758-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's getting ahead of it. Yeah,
once instead of the Logan,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26758-1
<v Ricky Horton>the scheduling program come along
compared to like Microsoft Project and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26758-2
<v Ricky Horton>their project schedule is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26789-0
<v Ricky Horton>If we're doing a project or re verify,
it's pretty deep value.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26789-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think I was here a couple of years ago
was wasn't anywhere near as good as</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26789-2
<v Ricky Horton>Microsoft Project.
It was so it's it's that same as one of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26789-3
<v Ricky Horton>us two years ago.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26827-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the problem that most people have with it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26827-1
<v Ricky Horton>is they they want to,
they want to bid for Excel with this and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26827-2
<v Ricky Horton>they know Excel and they sit down and do
this. It's like Microsoft Project,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26827-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know. So that's the problem. It's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26869-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's incredibly powerful.
Will it do the stuff like sales? Like, OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26869-1
<v Ricky Horton>this has gotta be done for for the start,
stop and finish to start, finish to start,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26869-2
<v Ricky Horton>and it'll give all those type of settings
in there. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26869-3
<v Ricky Horton>So you get the advantage of it reads the
information from within the system. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26869-4
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26906-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I always thought it would be cool to use</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26906-1
<v Ricky Horton>it, but every time I'd ask,
I was told that, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26906-2
<v Ricky Horton>it wasn't really as good as I I love the
schedule in there and I made a 10 part</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26906-3
<v Ricky Horton>video that I wanted on my on my YouTube
channel because I think people want to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26906-4
<v Ricky Horton>use it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26910-0
<v Ricky Horton>People don't give it enough.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26924-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, they'll have a patience.
Let me put it that way. Yes. Uh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26924-1
<v Ricky Horton>Microsoft Project could be that way too.
It'd be so big for patients to learn it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26924-2
<v Ricky Horton>I understand. Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26936-0
<v Ricky Horton>Does the scheduling module in RFM
incorporate costing?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26965-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, no,
it's it's pretty much your timeline and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26965-1
<v Ricky Horton>percentage is complete,
schedule hours and that's what we don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26965-2
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't do that.
It has the hours of it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/26965-3
<v Ricky Horton>so we can tell you, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27000-0
<v Ricky Horton>You had scheduled it to be done this
percent here this day and it's gonna know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27000-1
<v Ricky Horton>that it's not done there because not
hours were spent or yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27000-2
<v Ricky Horton>it actually does it. It looks at the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27015-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's a number of different ways you
can say it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27015-1
<v Ricky Horton>but essentially some of the pieces of
literature that are not regardless of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27015-2
<v Ricky Horton>hours understandable, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27017-0
<v Ricky Horton>This video reports to the supplier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27021-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now there's actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27060-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll I'll call it reschedules later.
There's the project schedule,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27060-1
<v Ricky Horton>which is the Microsoft project that can
field what's called the production</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27060-2
<v Ricky Horton>schedule in here that says OK,
this meeting hours over this time frame</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27060-3
<v Ricky Horton>that spreads the hours out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27081-0
<v Ricky Horton>A fairly simplified version that they
came out with what's called production</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27081-1
<v Ricky Horton>planner in 2025 version that is a much
more in depth.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27111-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shop schedule where they can take your
available hours and say, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27111-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're gonna meet those available hours
these weeks and these weeks you're not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27111-2
<v Ricky Horton>Yes. So you basically,
I've done that on Excel spreadsheet,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27111-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it's yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27153-0
<v Ricky Horton>The conversation and then it's like I
I'll have a year in advance. So OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27153-1
<v Ricky Horton>three months from now it looks like I'm a
little slow, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27153-2
<v Ricky Horton>or or I'm overbooked.
So I gotta either hire more guys or work</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27153-3
<v Ricky Horton>overtime. Yeah,
but it'll do stuff like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27153-4
<v Ricky Horton>And this is the one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27188-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so you basically you use what's called</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27188-1
<v Ricky Horton>the work packages and the work packages
can be auto populated with hours from the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27188-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate if the estimate's in here.
And so it says I've got 350 hours of work</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27188-3
<v Ricky Horton>for this package. Well,
you can drag it into a week and they'll</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27188-4
<v Ricky Horton>split it out by apartments if you wanted
to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27190-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27205-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just to like you, are you you wise?
I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27205-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm hard like you're on the same way home.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27211-0
<v Ricky Horton>This will be the same thing you would do
every time I try to edit.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27235-0
<v Ricky Horton>Jobs and units to and spins and spins
around and I go right back into it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27235-1
<v Ricky Horton>You need to.
You know we shouldn't be able to do this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27252-0
<v Ricky Horton>Guarantee you,
I'm gonna purchase it so when I try and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27252-1
<v Ricky Horton>view one of my reports,
it'll show me this area of the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27254-0
<v Ricky Horton>System is not having.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27274-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll text it wasn't ahead of Technical
Support,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27274-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm not sure that I don't think he is
anymore. I can talk to you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27284-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27287-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's a brutal, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27305-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
especially since we're trying to update</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27305-1
<v Ricky Horton>this program right now and get all of
some stuff in there and have this problem</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27305-2
<v Ricky Horton>sucks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27309-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, let's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27320-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a new thing with us and hospitals
and suburbals, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27320-1
<v Ricky Horton>keep us on our clothes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27348-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I used to use natural and near
unfactual and I just wait, wait,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27348-1
<v Ricky Horton>wait to be aware of water,
drop by the water cooler,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27348-2
<v Ricky Horton>chit chat about everything come back over.
So I'll give out another few minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27374-0
<v Ricky Horton>You were using it. I had, I had the old,
old bathroom and and so it's the path.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27374-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah, it was awesome. You know,
I had, I had the same phone. Terrible.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27374-2
<v Ricky Horton>Can I use it though?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27378-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is my exit board and I asked you to
phone.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27406-0
<v Ricky Horton>I asked him if he's seen any network
related issue for 2025 out and he said</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27406-1
<v Ricky Horton>have not seen any that I'm aware of at
least not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27406-2
<v Ricky Horton>We've been show the training so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27432-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just that you want me to see if one
of them can help me in and do what it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27432-1
<v Ricky Horton>what they saw. Not a bad idea. Definitely,
especially if we're going to start</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27432-2
<v Ricky Horton>feeling productive and then getting shot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27434-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mid-thought, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27436-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27440-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not condition anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27462-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do they know you as Revolution or do they
know you as?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27462-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty sure everything's been
switched at this point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27464-0
<v Ricky Horton>All of our licenses.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27479-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that was a that one was locked out.
I had a bunch of top projects that had</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27479-1
<v Ricky Horton>been pushed through.
I couldn't log in effect of this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27479-2
<v Ricky Horton>We didn't pay,
didn't pay for licensure control.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27491-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many of you guys are gonna use last
planner? Anybody gonna use last what?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27491-1
<v Ricky Horton>Last planner? I think you heard me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27492-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27525-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think we're talking about scheduling
CPM. I know it's critical path.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27525-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's a plan that assumes everything goes
right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27525-2
<v Ricky Horton>Last planner goes to the other production.
It looks the other way.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27525-3
<v Ricky Horton>It says these are we need what are these?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27554-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's going to take the main time.
So a lot of times the engineering</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27554-1
<v Ricky Horton>companies give you this primavera 3 level,
6 level,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27554-2
<v Ricky Horton>I have no idea what level and it's like
this is what we need and all the reality</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27554-3
<v Ricky Horton>is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27586-0
<v Ricky Horton>Very beautiful.
And so a lot of the construction trades</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27586-1
<v Ricky Horton>from what's called last time schedules
going the other way and there are really</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27586-2
<v Ricky Horton>good YouTube discussions over the pros
and cons, but if you're really the guy,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27586-3
<v Ricky Horton>you want to deploy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27588-0
<v Ricky Horton>Last month is better for you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27642-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you're the guy pushing the program,
you may do CPM,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27642-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's you're assuming all these things
actually work when you schedule it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27642-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now you can add folks to all kinds of
stuff to it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27642-3
<v Ricky Horton>but if you guys aren't familiar with us
planner,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27642-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's pretty used to establish the
construction.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27643-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the industry, uses it, uses it,
uses it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27645-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27654-0
<v Ricky Horton>People sitting in an office can say all
day long how long it's going to take.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27679-0
<v Ricky Horton>I drove from Ogden to Durango. Actually,
I was driving.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27679-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was just listening to last night or
YouTube, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27679-2
<v Ricky Horton>YouTube for a lot of that drive.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27693-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I figured I was getting ready to
go into, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27693-1
<v Ricky Horton>more of a construction based business
like this, yeah, like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27699-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's some tools there and that's the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27702-0
<v Ricky Horton>Everybody loves Gantt charts.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27725-0
<v Ricky Horton>They look because they're easy. Yeah.
And for me, these days,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27725-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you don't have earned valid,
then you're still doing that extra earned</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27725-2
<v Ricky Horton>valid work because everybody wants to
know you have to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27728-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, this will be a start.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27734-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm on top of you all again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27741-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just the last one to call.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27780-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but you know,
I don't know if it's going to be 2</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27780-1
<v Ricky Horton>minutes or two hours. I don't mind.
So usually when I hit up the head of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27780-2
<v Ricky Horton>support with it,
you kind of expedites it a little bit,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27780-3
<v Ricky Horton>pushes everything through. Yeah,
they kind of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27807-0
<v Ricky Horton>I've got to have a agent and if I'm on
site I have a lot of troubles there to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27807-1
<v Ricky Horton>try to get more.
I would they know you're a lot of times</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27807-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're at, you're at the site training.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27807-3
<v Ricky Horton>because you know how it goes out a lot of
the next week before you referral.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27835-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's true. They've been doing.
They've been doing pretty good with their</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27835-1
<v Ricky Horton>gear support stuff. That's good.
So usually 2-3 hours at Max.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27835-2
<v Ricky Horton>Otherwise I sometimes I call and within 5
minutes I can get somebody.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27835-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's awesome to go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27841-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's been the exact thing for really
bad over the past year or two, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27843-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now lean in there,
try and generating report.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27843-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's try to report the user everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27848-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thinking there's an issue that I don't
know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27888-0
<v Ricky Horton>Basically saying that more than that
because that's what I'm working on. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27888-1
<v Ricky Horton>So this one you need to go where you want.
So you you guys have to value what you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27888-2
<v Ricky Horton>what you're going to say.
Obviously if you need to do this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27888-3
<v Ricky Horton>I think there's advantage to put
everything in one system because it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27888-4
<v Ricky Horton>drives everybody two to one system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27912-0
<v Ricky Horton>This was consistent,
but it definitely what what you really so</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27912-1
<v Ricky Horton>so you can't be on this though when I do
you are the one that asks for certain</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27912-2
<v Ricky Horton>pieces.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27914-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, what the heck?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27918-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now there we go every time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27930-0
<v Ricky Horton>The spinning wheel of death. Yeah,
the good thing is that it's a repeatable</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27930-1
<v Ricky Horton>problem.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27946-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah. Otherwise you have a problem.
So now they logged in on me,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27946-1
<v Ricky Horton>they can see it, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27968-0
<v Ricky Horton>Theory. Yeah, there's meeting.
I don't do what they did last time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27968-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is Steve.
There's something wrong with your system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27968-2
<v Ricky Horton>You should freak out. Yes, there is.
That's what.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/27976-0
<v Ricky Horton>Reinstall. This is that on my page.
Let me do my job, please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28002-0
<v Ricky Horton>Only imagine what audit's doing if you
can't pull reports. Yeah. Are you sure?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28002-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like, how are we?
How am I supposed to pull each member</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28002-2
<v Ricky Horton>report for a job if this is working? Yeah,
well, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28016-0
<v Ricky Horton>They are excellent on the production side.
So we've got to say we can track</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28016-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything we you know what we need to do
there. We looked at.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28048-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then the inspection basically set up
and be on that, right? Yep. Yeah, that's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28048-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is there anything else on the production
side for the cadence? I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28048-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can think of that, Kevin.
The flooring's only in the flooring's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28048-3
<v Ricky Horton>complex.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28077-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you want to expand on those,
you can do with coatings complex with a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28077-1
<v Ricky Horton>specified prep that we can do,
but that's just gonna have more stations</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28077-2
<v Ricky Horton>in your in our system.
What's what's what's the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28126-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's the part? What's the? Yeah,
you see the issues, the questions,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28126-1
<v Ricky Horton>any problems? I mean, you know,
that's one thing I have to worry about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28126-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not going to have anything. Yeah,
that's good. So right now, I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28126-3
<v Ricky Horton>I've said what I what I thought.
I'm going to find out, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28165-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's we're not going to find anything out
until we actually run, run,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28165-1
<v Ricky Horton>run my job through it.
We'll see what the case are other than</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28165-2
<v Ricky Horton>time consumption aspect of it.
If I'm going to have like my painters</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28165-3
<v Ricky Horton>specifically started doing this or if I'm
going to have a lead out in the shop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28187-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be the one taking down all this data
because it can,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28187-1
<v Ricky Horton>depending on the side of the side of the
job, it can be a lighting process.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28187-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if this would be I don't
think I can answer this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28188-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28199-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I'll tell you what, I have a client.
Can I call you back when I leave?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28199-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is that OK?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28205-0
<v Ricky Horton>Perfect. Yeah, yeah, just send.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28206-0
<v Ricky Horton>Up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28216-0
<v Ricky Horton>That'd be perfect.
I can perfectly help you. All right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28216-1
<v Ricky Horton>no problem. Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28219-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, that wasn't there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28234-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm guessing is what do you gain if we
put the breakdown instead of this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28260-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hang simple or main complex or whatever
it is, we start doing it SP1 simple thing,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28260-1
<v Ricky Horton>SP2 simple thing like break that up.
What other benefits you could get?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28260-2
<v Ricky Horton>It would just be the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28299-0
<v Ricky Horton>Being able to differentiate your start
and stop findings, how that differs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28299-1
<v Ricky Horton>So at the end of the day,
you're getting the same data,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28299-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're getting the same markup,
but you're going to be doing the same</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28299-3
<v Ricky Horton>start-stop system and you'll be able to
identify what's taking longer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28341-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're just gonna have different.
It's the same exact setup,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28341-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's just a different call out for it in
the same start stop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28341-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'll probably want that in finish. Yeah,
you can have that in the finish field SB,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28341-3
<v Ricky Horton>SB,
simple or complex or whatever you want to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28341-4
<v Ricky Horton>do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey Nancy,
you have that you have visibility to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28385-1
<v Ricky Horton>finish field in there and then the routes
you're tracking because I'd like to get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28385-2
<v Ricky Horton>to the way to where I get this job.
It's a it's an SP3 with this this primer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28385-3
<v Ricky Horton>I want to see what our historicals has
been before that specific system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28419-0
<v Ricky Horton>Be able to filter very easily.
We do it as a paint simple prep paint</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28419-1
<v Ricky Horton>complex and it's going to give me a boat
load of jobs that I'm going to have to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28419-2
<v Ricky Horton>filter through all based off.
Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28419-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if you if you did that as the finish
of P3C.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28437-0
<v Ricky Horton>We would be able to filter for all these
pieces and the time for and if you do the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28437-1
<v Ricky Horton>start shot, yeah,
that would be filling out. But yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28437-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's something to finish.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28447-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I was gonna say you might have to clean</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28447-1
<v Ricky Horton>up some of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28448-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28463-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you have any type of standard
legislation for that? OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28463-1
<v Ricky Horton>so then I have to come up about the
system.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28501-0
<v Ricky Horton>And if you can get your detailers to do
that field for you or you can just import</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28501-1
<v Ricky Horton>it or that would make it very simple to
to use to import it cause they're already</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28501-2
<v Ricky Horton>putting on trials anyway, right?
So although if it's if it's a coding zone,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28501-3
<v Ricky Horton>you'll have control over that there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28508-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'd say that and see what you what
primarily runs through the shop, I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28530-0
<v Ricky Horton>Excuse me, SP2 or SP3,
maybe SP6 every once in a while and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28530-1
<v Ricky Horton>beyond that I don't think we're able to
get 2 on a driver or two coats of paint</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28530-2
<v Ricky Horton>pencil, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28558-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or zinc. Zinc needs to be separated.
That's really surprising to me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28558-1
<v Ricky Horton>Like my impression though,
you guys were doing lots of SD6, you know?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28592-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, we would keep them on paper, right.
But as as a fabricator, we, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28592-1
<v Ricky Horton>sometimes we want to. I mean,
they're sending delightful.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28592-2
<v Ricky Horton>They ain't sending delightful by now.
Now again, they'll send the light bulbs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28592-3
<v Ricky Horton>No,
we don't have any comment that we</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28592-4
<v Ricky Horton>recently got done so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28597-0
<v Ricky Horton>He wants to go. I've done it.
It was easier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28611-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that's at the speed six. Yeah,
I think it's actually correct. OK, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28611-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's too close to Derek finish.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28623-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think the complex is pretty much always
in the I guess complex on the SP2SP3 and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28623-1
<v Ricky Horton>SP6, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28624-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably never see one week.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28649-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, that's a big.
We rarely do miss the money.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28649-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's honestly never happened.
What about all those water stuff?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28649-2
<v Ricky Horton>Isn't that SB10 on the water? Yeah,
but that's how I feel.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28654-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have nothing here in the shop.
We have some tank plates.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28694-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all SP6 too. Maybe.
I think just the group there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28694-1
<v Ricky Horton>not the group that was SP6,
the pipe schools are around here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28694-2
<v Ricky Horton>What is that? Is that? That's all right,
three times.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28694-3
<v Ricky Horton>So that's just an SP2 handstand and just
pressure wash to get the dust off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28726-0
<v Ricky Horton>Somebody else? Yeah.
So a lot of the coatings always we do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28726-1
<v Ricky Horton>We exclude manufacturers, prep and prime.
So any steel you want to ship us in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28726-2
<v Ricky Horton>shop we're a bit more.
We do a bit more from scratch,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28726-3
<v Ricky Horton>but all the field stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28740-0
<v Ricky Horton>We try to get away from the initial just
because it takes sandblast and no one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28740-1
<v Ricky Horton>wants to pay for it on the field.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28782-0
<v Ricky Horton>When we run a production job,
when you import, get everything in there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28782-1
<v Ricky Horton>you have to find your codings only route
and they will find and finish and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28782-2
<v Ricky Horton>they'll have the ability to filter it out.
So that would give you the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28817-0
<v Ricky Horton>The granular level of load over here
going forward,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28817-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I think this will pretty much cover
us. So SP2SP3, SP13 or we'll see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28817-2
<v Ricky Horton>I mean down the road.
These are the most common stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28820-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is super easy to have anyways.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28831-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you have to ramp up,
you're calling to SB6SB10 in the future.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28840-0
<v Ricky Horton>Big deal. No big deal. You know,
just take some dirt. It's got a yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28841-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did the hall you do how many tests?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28848-0
<v Ricky Horton>The old Joe smoking refreshment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28891-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
the biggest problem I have out there is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28891-1
<v Ricky Horton>the guys realizing the difference between
SP6 and SP10, for example,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28891-2
<v Ricky Horton>making sure they're using the right. Yeah,
a few months ago we had some new guys</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28891-3
<v Ricky Horton>start blasting and the first thing they
blasted was one of those government</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28891-4
<v Ricky Horton>trailers over this weekend.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28921-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we have those big WW calls
coming in and they thought they needed to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28921-1
<v Ricky Horton>get an SP10 and it looks like an SP10 and
so it was taking a guy 3 days of last</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28921-2
<v Ricky Horton>night.
We brought a new guy just about last time</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28921-3
<v Ricky Horton>he was getting a call.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28951-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, yeah,
that's that's a big difference. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28951-1
<v Ricky Horton>give the guy a credit.
I don't know that I could,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28951-2
<v Ricky Horton>especially with all that gear on,
tell the difference that easily something</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28951-3
<v Ricky Horton>you got to learn what you're constantly.
I can't something easily.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28957-0
<v Ricky Horton>You gotta see them both side by side to
realize the differences, then you're good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/28962-0
<v Ricky Horton>As well as you do it all the time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29004-0
<v Ricky Horton>What I was just going to be into is now
that we have you know with us going</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29004-1
<v Ricky Horton>through what we do have set up for for
coding's estimation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29004-2
<v Ricky Horton>We have SB1 through SB10 are they broken
up in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29004-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know what we have to look up for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29027-0
<v Ricky Horton>As in labor standards.
And then we have our current few</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29027-1
<v Ricky Horton>different coding systems in there and you
can take a look at those and we can make</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29027-2
<v Ricky Horton>adjustments in that tab if we need to in
there. Tell me what you got to see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29029-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29053-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we didn't know how many square foot
per hour you guys are doing and then how</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29053-1
<v Ricky Horton>much would be abrasive pounds per square
foot you guys are using.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29055-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we kind of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29079-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's SP2. I mean,
right now we estimate like all the post</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29079-1
<v Ricky Horton>stuff, any of the runways, any shop stuff.
We do it on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29079-2
<v Ricky Horton>We do it on prep at 100 on the paying
gallon square feet an hour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29130-0
<v Ricky Horton>The problem is,
it really depends on the type of material.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29130-1
<v Ricky Horton>If you're working with the structural,
you'll get a lot more square footage done</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29130-2
<v Ricky Horton>and you're working with smaller trues and
angles and places and that kind of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29130-3
<v Ricky Horton>So these are customizable.
You're not stuck with this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29130-4
<v Ricky Horton>You could do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29145-0
<v Ricky Horton>SB2 like or something like that and have
two different rates if you want to apply.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29145-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you can bill these out differently if
you wanted to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29150-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mr. Potentious, it's probably not support.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29155-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll do that. Do that hungry.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29169-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, our SP2 is just. Yeah, this is. Yeah,
so you can. OK, this seems not why.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29170-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29171-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29176-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do that at once.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29221-0
<v Ricky Horton>I love you got these numbers. I I I'm,
I can break out a little of the number of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29221-1
<v Ricky Horton>shops that have these numbers.
It's so it's great to be out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29221-2
<v Ricky Horton>After every job I go back and I see the
challenge I face in making sure the guys</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29221-3
<v Ricky Horton>apply the time for the right clothes,
yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29240-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I I go back and I try to clean it up
to where I am.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29240-1
<v Ricky Horton>This is how I know this is how much
production we get on this type of stuff</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29240-2
<v Ricky Horton>or that type of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29242-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29246-0
<v Ricky Horton>Watching the screen.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29256-0
<v Ricky Horton>The code is all new ones.
All I set up was the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29257-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29293-0
<v Ricky Horton>I would just run with what we have here.
I'll make the adjustments as well as to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29293-1
<v Ricky Horton>make sure all the employees of their
coatings have something associated with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29293-2
<v Ricky Horton>it and we can make the adjustments on the
runtime and then do a drop date of when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29293-3
<v Ricky Horton>they're going to contract.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29307-0
<v Ricky Horton>And make sure all of our active projects
have been out on the board meetings. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29307-1
<v Ricky Horton>solving cleaning,
going faster than power cleaning.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29307-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is that legit?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29324-0
<v Ricky Horton>Solid cleaning says 600 square square
foot per hour and power tool cleaning</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29324-1
<v Ricky Horton>says the thousand square foot per hour.
This is probably amount of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29325-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29327-0
<v Ricky Horton>See where you have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29329-0
<v Ricky Horton>Affirms.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29334-0
<v Ricky Horton>From America, I told you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29341-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're the one who said things like the
******* piece, so you can throw it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29355-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's me one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29387-0
<v Ricky Horton>I love it. We don't do it.
SP3 is our standard,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29387-1
<v Ricky Horton>so whenever an estimator creates a sniff
and associates that one with the little</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29387-2
<v Ricky Horton>asterisks is the one that's going to
default.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29390-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I keep that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29399-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this one's going to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29426-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do we want to do something similar with
that as as small and slaves and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29426-1
<v Ricky Horton>heavy structure? No, no,
that's that's the same. OK, SP5,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29426-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's pretty, but I'll do it on that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29429-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I'll say put it at 10.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29436-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do you think we'll iron orders?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29438-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that could be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29458-0
<v Ricky Horton>Obviously these are all things that we
can go in and go in the maintenance and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29458-1
<v Ricky Horton>codings. OK, SP6SP6 put that at like 130.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29467-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you've been trying to know how
many panels and if work bounds the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29488-0
<v Ricky Horton>The good thing is I have to come in today.
We can put on a sandpots,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29488-1
<v Ricky Horton>start getting guys in the middle of this
year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29491-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know where I got that from?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29502-0
<v Ricky Horton>I shot lasting clean, you know,
and grace of use on that one. Uh, four.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29502-1
<v Ricky Horton>Keep it at four. No, that one too. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29507-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29511-0
<v Ricky Horton>Near why put that at 90 other hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29542-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then four hours long, 5 on this one.
So we got the speed that actually bring</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29542-1
<v Ricky Horton>bring that down to 8 on this,
so I'm going to get the the use of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29542-2
<v Ricky Horton>accurate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29549-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, me as well. Well,
I think the future you're gonna have it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29549-1
<v Ricky Horton>if you can save us.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29558-0
<v Ricky Horton>Get us some status and we'll put it in.
Where are we going to do that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29560-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that the?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29577-0
<v Ricky Horton>They've got these to find. You know,
you've got some public cycling areas,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29577-1
<v Ricky Horton>some of the perpetual issues,
so potentially.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29595-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, exactly. I mean,
while we're on the blast,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29595-1
<v Ricky Horton>good fabricated information right there.
Do you know what the plating embrace of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29595-2
<v Ricky Horton>prices up there? Is that Saturday or 10?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29598-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29601-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, is it per time? Yeah, per time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29611-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do we take great things for God to listen?
Yes, well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29612-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's the very.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29613-0
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29622-0
<v Ricky Horton>18 magnitude. No, that's what superset.
That's two times, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29628-0
<v Ricky Horton>400 is 2 * 9565.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29632-0
<v Ricky Horton>So can you put in different braces?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29672-0
<v Ricky Horton>This one's just in the one.
It's just we need different consumption</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29672-1
<v Ricky Horton>rates. OK,
so I'm already clear then about pricing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29672-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's there's always a way.
So I mean if we zero this out,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29672-3
<v Ricky Horton>there are other ways to do it which would
be a little bit more difficult on a take</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29672-4
<v Ricky Horton>off basis, but we could do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29707-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because here's some we're trying to get
the shop fully on technical.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29707-1
<v Ricky Horton>Basically use the shop or new garden
recycled garden because I got recycled</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29707-2
<v Ricky Horton>over here and use and steel stuff.
I guess we do, but it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29713-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not like it as consumable as.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29722-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's more of those poor bank prices,
each ones at a different price.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29731-0
<v Ricky Horton>So how do we account for that?
What determines which one you need?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29759-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think you go with the new one.
New Garth. Yeah, yeah, that price is good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29759-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is this the local place to put all this
stuff in for the whole system?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29759-2
<v Ricky Horton>This is your estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29769-0
<v Ricky Horton>This particular folk are playing just for
isolating.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29813-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I don't see it in here,
but it's not populated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29813-1
<v Ricky Horton>The data was not populated. Yeah. Well,
now most of the most of the estimating if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29813-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're adding like material pricing or
if they're adding consumable pricing and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29813-3
<v Ricky Horton>stuff like that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29842-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're pulling the labor out of this,
and then they're creating separate line</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29842-1
<v Ricky Horton>items and pulling their own data and
putting it in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29842-2
<v Ricky Horton>The estimators don't use the system for
much more than labor hours at this point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29842-3
<v Ricky Horton>They're consumables are a separate line
item.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29900-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to send that letters.
We were talking about adding that in to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29900-1
<v Ricky Horton>the first quarter because they want us to
track consumables for a job and it's it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29900-2
<v Ricky Horton>like a with the way certain machines work,
you wind up with all the consumers on one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29900-3
<v Ricky Horton>job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29921-0
<v Ricky Horton>So every time you purchase,
they want you to put it all over a job</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29921-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're working on. So yeah,
I want to try to figure that out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29921-2
<v Ricky Horton>What's future plans today?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29960-0
<v Ricky Horton>The interstate estimating they want to
really be in here on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29960-1
<v Ricky Horton>They want it all to run through this one
system. We all the proposals have,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29960-2
<v Ricky Horton>but what I really say is it's not in here
now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29960-3
<v Ricky Horton>but we need to mention that we need to
roll all that **** in there,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29960-4
<v Ricky Horton>even their time,
even their time to develop the jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29985-0
<v Ricky Horton>That needs to be accounted.
Everything that would have us put on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29985-1
<v Ricky Horton>jobs need to be in the estimator.
I'm just saying right now I'm just doing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29985-2
<v Ricky Horton>this as a blank field.
I'm not sure what you're looking to say.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29996-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
so they've got the capacities in here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/29996-1
<v Ricky Horton>You know, are these numbers right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30043-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll bet you they are because they're not
the out of the boxes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30043-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm sure we've looked at it before.
So yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30043-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm pretty sure that's a lot of this is
really you got an angle that's big when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30043-3
<v Ricky Horton>you run through your angle line.
So a lot of this doesn't have to do so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30078-0
<v Ricky Horton>So much of the time it's on this
particular spring.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30078-1
<v Ricky Horton>So the sphere there is one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30116-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm cutting the plate that says if I can
share it based off of the perimeters I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30116-1
<v Ricky Horton>have here apply that time there for shear.
So here it's here now so it's not going</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30116-2
<v Ricky Horton>to do any shear and it's going to just
always assume burning.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30147-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, yeah,
we zeroed that out last time because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30147-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're having a lot of issues with our
plate done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30147-2
<v Ricky Horton>This majority of our stuff is able to run
the sheer,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30147-3
<v Ricky Horton>which almost nothing ever was about all
weird. So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30165-0
<v Ricky Horton>Your paints are probably pretty much sick,
right? Those are pretty much. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30165-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think most of those were were well
defined in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30165-2
<v Ricky Horton>There was some tweaks that we had to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30176-0
<v Ricky Horton>So is that the 80% of what you did right
there?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30201-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's say, well,
you got the manufacturer off macropoxy,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30201-1
<v Ricky Horton>but yeah, macropoxy. All right.
Now for that, that container size,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30201-2
<v Ricky Horton>is that like the minimum quantity,
I guess you'd say it's a rammed up type</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30201-3
<v Ricky Horton>feature, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30212-0
<v Ricky Horton>So Ben just adding .
75 of the L It's gonna round it up to one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30212-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, yeah, change that to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30221-0
<v Ricky Horton>Macrobox is either in a two or a 10k
opportunity.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30226-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, Manufacturer is Sherwin. Price is 49.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30228-0
<v Ricky Horton>Drop to the next.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30246-0
<v Ricky Horton>Double layer,
double layer of multipliers on the labor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30246-1
<v Ricky Horton>rate that we have in here for us to
become a more if this is simplified.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30285-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're not a record.
It's a intermediate filler and then a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30285-1
<v Ricky Horton>finished filler. The product is separate.
There's a there's a setting back that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30285-2
<v Ricky Horton>says paint or say 43 beam.
Here's how it's most people are saying</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30285-3
<v Ricky Horton>that. Here's what it doesn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30342-0
<v Ricky Horton>Prime that and that's how many minutes
that is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30342-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that later multiplier layer of two
says I'm going to double that time for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30342-2
<v Ricky Horton>for macro oxy rather than prime.
Now right or wrong we can set that later.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30342-3
<v Ricky Horton>Well it it kind of makes sense but I'm
thinking not because it's too close but</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30342-4
<v Ricky Horton>because you most of the time you got two
guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30375-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's your painter and you got your pot
center. So whatever,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30375-1
<v Ricky Horton>if one guy spends one hour just to pay
physically, you got two men. So I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30375-2
<v Ricky Horton>we can keep it there, I guess.
If it doesn't, so cruise it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30375-3
<v Ricky Horton>Did you say 45 or 40?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30401-0
<v Ricky Horton>49 and we can we can set this number to
run on the same desert following.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30401-1
<v Ricky Horton>Steel spec compared the size to 5 gallons.
And what back of proxy we use since 46?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30401-2
<v Ricky Horton>What was that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30430-0
<v Ricky Horton>What box do you use? 646? Yeah,
but but it's 646 because it's another</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30430-1
<v Ricky Horton>back one that we use occasionally. Yeah,
I use the tenants and move.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30433-0
<v Ricky Horton>That I don't care.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30440-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh,
also change this the thickness for that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30440-1
<v Ricky Horton>one else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30448-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh no,
tell them what they just keep it for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30448-1
<v Ricky Horton>Usually just do one code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30457-0
<v Ricky Horton>Steel spec container size is 5 gallons on
that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30468-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is a change. It's over.
You can keep the coverage at 1:50.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30468-1
<v Ricky Horton>I said six. What's the numbers on that?
100? Yeah, it was 100. Yeah, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30468-2
<v Ricky Horton>put that at 1.5.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30470-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, for the for the Max.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30526-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you can do the same with this like
big structural smallness.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30526-1
<v Ricky Horton>So when you have that cost in there,
you need to pick up all the costs for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30526-2
<v Ricky Horton>thinners and all that stuff.
So people will have thinner in there as</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30526-3
<v Ricky Horton>well.
So they'll have it separately and just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30526-4
<v Ricky Horton>there's not many times when they just
move for the for the government.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30559-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you can you can include the the
theater in that or have a separate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30559-1
<v Ricky Horton>theater in his parking places.
There you go. If you want to,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30559-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can do it.
I'm sure you're buying so much thinner</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30559-3
<v Ricky Horton>per gallon.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30599-0
<v Ricky Horton>So was there a way that that can be tied?
If it's estimated 20 gallons of macro,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30599-1
<v Ricky Horton>it means that I need 5% of the dinner.
Well, you can say $29.00 add 5 bucks. Yes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30599-2
<v Ricky Horton>either that way or do you want to say so
much, so much for dinner or so much?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30606-0
<v Ricky Horton>For for a problem or do you want to just
like from?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30606-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll carry it through to the end of that
number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30642-0
<v Ricky Horton>Either or that's that's what we got.
The estimators are going to just want one</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30642-1
<v Ricky Horton>number. They are one number.
It's going to make it easier for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30642-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimators if it's just all in one. Yeah,
just copy pasting numbers.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30645-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, so you are here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30648-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or they wanted specific, yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30649-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30676-0
<v Ricky Horton>Of course it is.
I'm just saying if you do get a special</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30676-1
<v Ricky Horton>requirement, because I've seen it,
what's the 80%? What's the 80%?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30676-2
<v Ricky Horton>What's the majority of your work?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30677-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30712-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not about adding it,
it's about how do we deal with it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30712-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that's more of your question,
100% what I just respect.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30712-2
<v Ricky Horton>The question I can't remember off the top
of my head is the spec and the data sheet</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30712-3
<v Ricky Horton>are in line or not.
So what what you would do on that if you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30712-4
<v Ricky Horton>had something?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30729-0
<v Ricky Horton>So especially when you start your
estimate,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30729-1
<v Ricky Horton>this will pull into the estimate.
Then you can adjust these for that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30729-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate if you want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30738-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
let's just keep this thing here as a data</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30738-1
<v Ricky Horton>sheet.
Same thing on the quantity for the other</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30738-2
<v Ricky Horton>steels bag.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30739-0
<v Ricky Horton>So.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30748-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
Kate did not think that doesn't talk</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30748-1
<v Ricky Horton>about the third line.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30755-0
<v Ricky Horton>The third paint type we got. Oh yeah,
this one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30761-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you have 5 gallons and 36, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30772-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
you got that for small miscellaneous</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30772-1
<v Ricky Horton>stuff? Yeah, and you can do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30775-0
<v Ricky Horton>I saw it's in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30779-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all they're here. Yeah,
doing the data size of 1.25.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30793-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cost per gallon. It's it's like 90 day,
90 days coverage one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30795-0
<v Ricky Horton>160.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30800-0
<v Ricky Horton>Uh, take this for call 2 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30803-0
<v Ricky Horton>I will take the speed notes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30804-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30862-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to double multiplier for the
next? I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30862-1
<v Ricky Horton>if it if it still translates to where we
have been on the pot tender, let it know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30862-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine.
It depends on the time that you put in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30862-3
<v Ricky Horton>the background.
So if it's literally 15 minutes at home,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30862-4
<v Ricky Horton>then the two will get the two guys,
but if you say 30 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30882-0
<v Ricky Horton>To account for the two guys and we want
that one,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30882-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know it's like in that time tracking
that technical adult. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30882-2
<v Ricky Horton>there's some like go up to maintenance
estimating labor maintenance and labor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30882-3
<v Ricky Horton>standards.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30891-0
<v Ricky Horton>get down to a beam or something or
whatever,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30891-1
<v Ricky Horton>whatever material you want to go to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30921-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do the paint there says 44006 minutes.
See at the tops it's standard length of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30921-1
<v Ricky Horton>40 foot.
So that's what it's going to apply.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30921-2
<v Ricky Horton>So if you say 2, there's going to be 8.8.
12.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30963-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is this is what it estimates it
will take depending that when I put that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30963-1
<v Ricky Horton>multiplier and there's going to say that
there's going to be 8 minutes total 4</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30963-2
<v Ricky Horton>minutes for it.
So if you can do it whichever way you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30963-3
<v Ricky Horton>want, you can do it.
You can do the two multiplier over there</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30963-4
<v Ricky Horton>if this is the actual.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30972-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the actual time,
whereas if they don't have the birthday</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30972-1
<v Ricky Horton>skin, I don't know it will do one or two.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30974-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30990-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do we want to give them a little
structural dislanges for each one of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30990-1
<v Ricky Horton>these and call it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/30996-0
<v Ricky Horton>What is I saw? Is this 890? No,
it's just I saw.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31001-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's their product.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31011-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just know all their products by number
'cause they have different slightly</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31011-1
<v Ricky Horton>different numbers here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31015-0
<v Ricky Horton>In the system we find we have a job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31024-0
<v Ricky Horton>You need to put one in there for the hot
solids.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31029-0
<v Ricky Horton>Since we have 11 years of pain.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31030-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31070-0
<v Ricky Horton>Who pays to make this one? You customer.
Customer usually says give me like they</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31070-1
<v Ricky Horton>don't pick the brand. No,
they have a spec. They tell you they want,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31070-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know,
their crime coat to be an epoxy crime</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31070-3
<v Ricky Horton>coat percent solid, but extra at least.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31112-0
<v Ricky Horton>You pick them and then I I got to submit
something and they got approved. But yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31112-1
<v Ricky Horton>I have a choice. OK,
but do the estimators know what you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31112-2
<v Ricky Horton>picking?
Like there are other standard systems</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31112-3
<v Ricky Horton>that they know that estimating is. Yeah,
so for because I did estimating where I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31112-4
<v Ricky Horton>was at and we created.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31139-0
<v Ricky Horton>Couple of paid systems and we attached a
total the one price cost to that total</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31139-1
<v Ricky Horton>system.
I really didn't give you about Prosec.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31139-2
<v Ricky Horton>This system cost this much to do.
This system cost this much to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31139-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's the only point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31190-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's just like giving them different
options, but they're yeah, you didn't say.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31190-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have clients.
Sometimes they clients are like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31190-2
<v Ricky Horton>tell me how much it would cost you to do
with sherwin-williams versus. Here's,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31190-3
<v Ricky Horton>you know, baseline of the work.
Here's the practically Sherwin.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31190-4
<v Ricky Horton>Here's the other. Yeah,
we hated different vendors.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31195-0
<v Ricky Horton>'Cause you ended up with lots of left no
propane.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31201-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, you know, so all that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31221-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's why I'm curious, right?
We just pick systems and only if the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31221-1
<v Ricky Horton>customer forced us into somebody else's
paint when we do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31269-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now now how do we figure the time for
actual thing? How do we figure that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31269-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is there a is there a rate we got for
that or yeah, I got,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31269-2
<v Ricky Horton>I use just 100 square feet an hour
application rate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31269-3
<v Ricky Horton>So I've got two guys actually working on
that task, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31305-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, so that's with the two guys. Yeah.
So technically aspiration over 200 square</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31305-1
<v Ricky Horton>feet application.
So then we can get back in the language</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31305-2
<v Ricky Horton>standards,
pick a size and figure out what the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31305-3
<v Ricky Horton>square footage is for that piece.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31308-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we'll um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31321-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then we'll get the rate and will will
apply to everything so I can put in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31348-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or you can do it. Just go to an estimate,
put in a 11.5 point,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31348-1
<v Ricky Horton>see what the surface area is for that.
Then we'll figure that out what that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31348-2
<v Ricky Horton>timeline is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31358-0
<v Ricky Horton>Cream beside the ********. Yeah, I agree.
I mean, it's. I'll come.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31358-1
<v Ricky Horton>Bless me at this point.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31359-0
<v Ricky Horton>3.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31361-0
<v Ricky Horton>40, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31363-0
<v Ricky Horton>Also 82.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31369-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what time should that be 82 square
feet?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31375-0
<v Ricky Horton>Delete notes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31385-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you want to report it completely.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31414-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is,
this is what I was estimating in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31414-1
<v Ricky Horton>network.
So if I go back into the survey now and I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31414-2
<v Ricky Horton>double click on both the summary for
these two,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31414-3
<v Ricky Horton>here's the thing also I'm thinking of it
right here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31434-0
<v Ricky Horton>What I'm seeing is this is actually done
time. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31434-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm estimating that I'll take a space in
my account. I'm asking you for the time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31434-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm still tears. So please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31435-0
<v Ricky Horton>Perfect.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31470-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, question is,
do we separate that kind of stuff?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31470-1
<v Ricky Horton>Can we make a practice or can we do a
vast group?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31470-2
<v Ricky Horton>So we need to do a vast and how do we do
that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31470-3
<v Ricky Horton>That's we can't contact that because we
don't even get it from.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31503-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like there's there's no way you know how
much you have to mask until you get the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31503-1
<v Ricky Horton>drawing and you start mask. Yeah,
no one's going to give you this long</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31503-2
<v Ricky Horton>square feet of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31507-0
<v Ricky Horton>But you're saying in 8 minutes you're
going to do a point with B.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31537-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which is reasonable. I mean,
but that's like I said,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31537-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's it's done time.
It's time on that spray and getting that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31537-2
<v Ricky Horton>thing on there. Yeah.
And then increase it so it includes</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31537-3
<v Ricky Horton>masking time, right? Yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31551-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't forget the the efficiency factor.
I don't know how we want to handle that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31551-1
<v Ricky Horton>because you say you go 100 square feet in
a home, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31587-0
<v Ricky Horton>How you doing the 18 square feet in 8
minutes?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31587-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that that 100 square feet an hour,
that's for two guys and then that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31587-2
<v Ricky Horton>includes all the handling, labour,
domesting and whatever they got to do is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31587-3
<v Ricky Horton>get that piece from a prep to paint to
finish paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31620-0
<v Ricky Horton>But this year,
this is just calculating from what I see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31620-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's just calculating. I'm on the go.
Well, so does that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31620-2
<v Ricky Horton>does that 100 square feet an hour include
cleaning as well? Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31620-3
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe cleaning is going to be separate.
So we we had that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31656-0
<v Ricky Horton>Separate from that,
we said how much you work per square foot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31656-1
<v Ricky Horton>Oh,
the problem with cleaning is it's a set</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31656-2
<v Ricky Horton>time.
You're talking about thinking like to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31656-3
<v Ricky Horton>paint in your palms and that kind of
stuff. No, no, I'm sorry. It's for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31694-0
<v Ricky Horton>Correct. So no,
that 100 square feet does not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31694-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's essential.
So once it's done correct,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31694-2
<v Ricky Horton>they go to the painting phase.
That includes their basking sometimes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31694-3
<v Ricky Horton>setting up their pump, yeah,
grabbing their material,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31694-4
<v Ricky Horton>parking up a little desk,
all that kind of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31703-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's obviously the paint. Yeah,
that's our square feet program. Yeah, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31736-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah,
I mean that it's the problem is that it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31736-1
<v Ricky Horton>really, it's pretty lumped up together.
Yeah, that's that's the problem.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31736-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's why we're getting that high of a
rate compared to this and that high of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31736-3
<v Ricky Horton>permission.
I'd like to be able to get it down to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31736-4
<v Ricky Horton>break it up, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31774-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it doesn't serve your purpose.
I guess not really. OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31774-1
<v Ricky Horton>if it doesn't serve a purpose,
I'm sure if you've got it right there and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31774-2
<v Ricky Horton>we roll with it,
just that efficiency factor,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31774-3
<v Ricky Horton>if your default efficiency factor is 75%.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31804-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to be above that up another 25.
So you're basically going to be up to 25.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31804-1
<v Ricky Horton>Excuse me,
there will be less than 75 per hour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31804-2
<v Ricky Horton>So they want our efficiency factor to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31831-0
<v Ricky Horton>90 or 95% for when we plug in this bid
and get our numbers tailored to closer to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31831-1
<v Ricky Horton>accurate where we're shooting for 9 to
95% versus hitting an accurately in 75.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31873-0
<v Ricky Horton>So,
so the way you want to put it in the 100</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31873-1
<v Ricky Horton>square feet and then I'll put it at 100
right now and then see what we actually</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31873-2
<v Ricky Horton>get for this. Like I said,
the biggest thing is tracking the guys's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31873-3
<v Ricky Horton>actual time. I mean,
we put the budget and we've gone years</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31873-4
<v Ricky Horton>ago to apply it to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31913-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if you have this, it's a toss,
not how far they actually follow.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31913-1
<v Ricky Horton>But when we have this,
if we start tracking it actual in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31913-2
<v Ricky Horton>sequence,
we'll be able to dial those numbers and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31913-3
<v Ricky Horton>adjust them as we see through.
I'm still confused.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31917-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're saying it's 100 square feet in an
hour to paint?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31949-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're saying. Yes.
And here we're saying that this, this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31949-1
<v Ricky Horton>this is a book value.
We're going to put this in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31949-2
<v Ricky Horton>This got pulled in for whatever database
are, but you're about to put something in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31949-3
<v Ricky Horton>All right, good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31964-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
let's see what you're going to put in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31964-1
<v Ricky Horton>So that was what, 82?
It was 82 square feet,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31964-2
<v Ricky Horton>so it'll be 48 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31991-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now you can pass that to all of your
response, just to let crap out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31991-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can pass that to every everything else.
I said keep that for after.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/31991-2
<v Ricky Horton>That was just the case.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then it scales in for length too,
right? Yeah. So I'll take that back.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-1
<v Ricky Horton>Good to be like more operations right
there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-2
<v Ricky Horton>Let's just make sure it gets by the
square. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-3
<v Ricky Horton>by the painting a surface area,
some extrapolation back. So yes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-4
<v Ricky Horton>so it's going against piece and it's
going to surface area of each piece and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32035-5
<v Ricky Horton>and make that rubber shrink.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32037-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32043-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why did it not calculate that number?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32078-0
<v Ricky Horton>Already. If I could be able to put in 48,
if we knew 100, if we knew 82,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32078-1
<v Ricky Horton>why didn't it do the time? Well,
because it didn't know 100.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32078-2
<v Ricky Horton>So at this stage it didn't know 100,
right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32078-3
<v Ricky Horton>It it just had the the can down in it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32105-0
<v Ricky Horton>And so now that it knows that once we say
send and everything else,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32105-1
<v Ricky Horton>it knows the fact that we want to use and
then it'll use that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32105-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was a little bit of everything, right?
Well, that's one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32105-3
<v Ricky Horton>It's only one operations.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32114-0
<v Ricky Horton>So like to do that for angles, plates,
tubes as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32124-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did you get that same square footage
right, regardless of its shape?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32128-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is the same number, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32137-0
<v Ricky Horton>We use 150 just to let you know that was
my safe number.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32144-0
<v Ricky Horton>I always got burned on the plane by
always to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32154-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's that's that's why I'm using the
because you see all that back also there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32154-1
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32180-0
<v Ricky Horton>But what this system will let you do,
you correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32180-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're selecting the shapes where the 100
flies.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32180-2
<v Ricky Horton>Select the shapes where something else
applies.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32207-0
<v Ricky Horton>We could, yeah,
we could apply and incorporate different</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32207-1
<v Ricky Horton>changes that we want.
So if you do like everything round was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32207-2
<v Ricky Horton>this and everything not round is that you
could do that there if you want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32225-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because eventually when you do the
closeouts,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32225-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to start seeing which ones
are 100 and which ones take longer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32225-2
<v Ricky Horton>You're going to see it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32226-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want me to take the questions?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32239-0
<v Ricky Horton>We got.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32280-0
<v Ricky Horton>We got to do it.
We talk about this for paint, the paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32280-1
<v Ricky Horton>blast, all of them.
So blast is set already the paint that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32280-2
<v Ricky Horton>again, we got to set it for.
There's five types of material in here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32280-3
<v Ricky Horton>One is beams, which includes channels,
beams.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32330-0
<v Ricky Horton>WTS anything be like we got a bit for
angles,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32330-1
<v Ricky Horton>we got a bit for plates and tubes as well.
OK, so that's how the extrapolations work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32330-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you could have the separate factors
for those families and categories and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32330-3
<v Ricky Horton>then push them out. Yeah,
but in reality you could have a you could</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32330-4
<v Ricky Horton>have a different factor for every single
size of every single.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32335-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, you're in warranty,
but the way we're doing it, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32335-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're pushing that by family basically,
so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32351-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's one angle.
This is that 40 square foot per 140 foot</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32351-1
<v Ricky Horton>piece and currently oh, but same,
let's see the length up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32351-2
<v Ricky Horton>There's a pain hurter.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32352-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32367-0
<v Ricky Horton>On a start for Neil 10 square floor.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32384-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's 4.
35 that the wall simulator or that's what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32384-1
<v Ricky Horton>we'll see there.
So for chains for your foot, the fixes,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32384-2
<v Ricky Horton>yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32394-0
<v Ricky Horton>So all angle will be judged in terms.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32409-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
but that's the default that it uses to do</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32409-1
<v Ricky Horton>that track motion. So yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32428-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what happens when he has that lock
screen job up there? What's the intent?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32428-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's it's?
Where is this data coming driven from?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32437-0
<v Ricky Horton>Which one of those categories?
The the plant, since it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32437-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm assuming it's about the plate there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32439-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shouldn't that be 16?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32452-0
<v Ricky Horton>10 minutes, 10 divided by 6016,
what you have to divide.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32452-1
<v Ricky Horton>So 10 square feet to do 100 square feet
an hour, so it's .1.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32470-0
<v Ricky Horton>That was going to be about a six to be
given percentage.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32470-1
<v Ricky Horton>How many minutes it takes to do 10 square
feet?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32483-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many times to do it?
How many minutes does it take to do this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32483-1
<v Ricky Horton>piece of ankle? Yeah, 46 inch square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32484-0
<v Ricky Horton>I do that on this work on that way.
Mm-hmm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32487-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that is something else. OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32489-0
<v Ricky Horton>Come on, give me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32499-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, I think you just took a tent.
I'll sort of it backwards here. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32499-1
<v Ricky Horton>you you skipped what's there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32501-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32504-0
<v Ricky Horton>40 foot on it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32506-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many more schools here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32537-0
<v Ricky Horton>19 Yeah,
I don't know how you thought it was only</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32537-1
<v Ricky Horton>that come up with that recently.
You're probably there right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32537-2
<v Ricky Horton>We use 53.333.
You're still very confident in the 1st to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32537-3
<v Ricky Horton>show up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32548-0
<v Ricky Horton>32 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32550-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're not telling ****.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32565-0
<v Ricky Horton>That is the penance to do that.
That's what I've I guess because that are</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32565-1
<v Ricky Horton>changing unless there's a labor in stage
in there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32575-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's right.
Any estimators not in the estimator?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32576-0
<v Ricky Horton>But.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32614-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess it's more of a question,
but anything that's going to be done here</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32614-1
<v Ricky Horton>at the shop needs to be estimated.
So is Matt going to be estimating the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32614-2
<v Ricky Horton>shop stuff for your Tecla and kill stuff
for your take a job and make a good of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32614-3
<v Ricky Horton>whatever since I was talking yesterday.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32619-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like it's start, then it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32624-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's something we will with the scores
only.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32646-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then we'd have to have Matt do it or have
one of those guys anyway.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32646-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's the same I'm saying,
but even in here it doesn't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32646-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's the guesswork out. I mean,
that's the whole point of this is like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32646-3
<v Ricky Horton>anybody.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32664-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's the whole point of this small
lesson.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32664-1
<v Ricky Horton>We do it based on your numbers here.
I'm sorry to say you're.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32679-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why are you sorry to say that?
Is it frustrating?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32679-1
<v Ricky Horton>It felt like it was a hard tilt swallow,
but they have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32682-0
<v Ricky Horton>I just want to make sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32698-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to be a current curve,
but I would like to get started since I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32698-1
<v Ricky Horton>get something grand with this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32699-0
<v Ricky Horton>This one we got one one when you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32700-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32703-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right, please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32712-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what if you have a contract for the?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32720-0
<v Ricky Horton>250 square foot.
How can we build that here?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32721-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32729-0
<v Ricky Horton>So maybe we need to drop that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32756-0
<v Ricky Horton>Start with that.
Is that other circle includes the two</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32756-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys? Yeah.
So we probably will take that two off of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32756-2
<v Ricky Horton>there so it doesn't double up on that,
right? And it's going.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32756-3
<v Ricky Horton>Am I thinking you correct?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32781-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
so if that's if that's the time for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32781-1
<v Ricky Horton>two guys,
one guy spraying a little guy on the pot,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32781-2
<v Ricky Horton>then yeah,
so when I get a I get a job that's 1000</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32781-3
<v Ricky Horton>square feet,
I'll have 10 hours paint that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32811-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then those 10 hours essentially going to
be 5 hours of painting and five hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32811-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we need to take that out of the house.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32811-2
<v Ricky Horton>So how does that affect the schedule?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32848-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's also been sent to the battles
regardless. Yeah, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32848-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's contracting for a matter,
but the most people are saying for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32848-2
<v Ricky Horton>other one. Yeah, yeah. Well, no,
it'll be excited. No, it'll be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32848-3
<v Ricky Horton>You said how many, how many guys got out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32860-0
<v Ricky Horton>It gave me your capacity.
It's 600 hours capacity,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32860-1
<v Ricky Horton>but not like it's being utilized.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32870-0
<v Ricky Horton>That space is taken up for 10 hours on
the schedule. If it's out, yeah, here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32870-1
<v Ricky Horton>you'll be here. Look at that that way now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32879-0
<v Ricky Horton>No space is going to be important.
As you see, the resource.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32923-0
<v Ricky Horton>It thinks the resource is 1,
even though we know the resource is 2</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32923-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys. Yeah,
so you have your pool of hours,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32923-2
<v Ricky Horton>you have your 10 guys running 10 hours,
you have a lot of hours,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32923-3
<v Ricky Horton>but and then you're just pulling 10 out.
So you're you're houring your work</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32923-4
<v Ricky Horton>capacity, but if we're looking at space.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32933-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just thinking ahead.
We might stop digging inside and we're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32933-1
<v Ricky Horton>going to be trying to figure it out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32966-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean also goes down the drive.
So the the the new planner,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32966-1
<v Ricky Horton>the the newest schedule in there,
it it can do the the,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32966-2
<v Ricky Horton>it can do the capacity two different ways,
either hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32999-0
<v Ricky Horton>4 tons that doesn't give you space,
but it gives you some other factor,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/32999-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know what I'm saying?
So and you can talk between the two.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33004-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's all factored in production,
but I break.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33034-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's set up a list. You know,
first I'll add something in there real</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33034-1
<v Ricky Horton>quick and we'll see where it comes up.
I will have to cover it quickly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33041-0
<v Ricky Horton>What do you want to get the shot
efficiency there?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33061-0
<v Ricky Horton>And I'm also coming to be against 75% of
investment independent. So right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33061-1
<v Ricky Horton>they will need to change the payments or
pay systems or point systems. OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33064-0
<v Ricky Horton>Look, look complex and you really can do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33069-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you know the hours on this job?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33080-0
<v Ricky Horton>I do still spec in background,
still spec in high songs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33082-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you can change.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33089-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can change one of them to these.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33106-0
<v Ricky Horton>So are you, are you saying that here?
Are you a little class stating shot?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33106-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just going to put both of those on
here, OK?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33108-0
<v Ricky Horton>0 SP6.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go back to your clean system real quick
just to make sure you understand if all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're going to use on this job is SP6,
you don't need to do a system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's just going to use some drop down up
there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-3
<v Ricky Horton>But if I need to choose between SP6 and
SP3 for different pieces,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-4
<v Ricky Horton>then I won't do systems,
but otherwise leaving it like that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33156-5
<v Ricky Horton>you're just going to get SP6 so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33157-0
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33189-0
<v Ricky Horton>I build systems for all these different
codes and it gives me a breakdown first</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33189-1
<v Ricky Horton>for coat. Well, it gives you a breakdown.
Here's the type of gallons and cost for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33189-2
<v Ricky Horton>the page.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33208-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here's the total hours that you got to
that as well for each coach or the the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33208-1
<v Ricky Horton>the hours you're going to give is going
to be the total hours for the bank.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33232-0
<v Ricky Horton>Now we can filter, we can get that, yeah.
So we can filter with that and we can</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33232-1
<v Ricky Horton>just the nagrotoxy and we'll see here's
total for just nagrotoxy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33236-0
<v Ricky Horton>No love today. Oh God.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33278-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let me help me back here.
When you hear me in my desk and you see a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33278-1
<v Ricky Horton>Lego that flying across the room,
this is what's talking about. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33278-2
<v Ricky Horton>you haven't been in my office. Yeah,
they got Legos all over my desk.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33278-3
<v Ricky Horton>I think I remember from last time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33283-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I got a T-rex in me. It's awesome.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33284-0
<v Ricky Horton>See.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33285-0
<v Ricky Horton>That ******* basketball's doing that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33292-0
<v Ricky Horton>Guess I can't go out there with not much.
Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33310-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33321-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll see the leg over there. Oh,
that's awesome. I've got, uh, the uh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33321-1
<v Ricky Horton>storming night.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33339-0
<v Ricky Horton>In here as well, on the map, one of the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33340-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33355-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is this something only or is this bad as
well? That's bad as well. Did you ask?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33366-0
<v Ricky Horton>They're going to.
He's going to rise to make this one to at</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33366-1
<v Ricky Horton>this one too. I've got to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33390-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
all three of those are almost $300 a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33390-1
<v Ricky Horton>piece and inexpensive.
I didn't think about it all the years,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33390-2
<v Ricky Horton>but for the zoning projects,
probably to create.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33396-0
<v Ricky Horton>A labor committee that only includes pain.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33426-0
<v Ricky Horton>That way the package will be globally
applied. I think it's going there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33426-1
<v Ricky Horton>You just pick where you see things you
want and then it doesn't have all the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33426-2
<v Ricky Horton>other faculty.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33432-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
you don't have to switch everything in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33432-1
<v Ricky Horton>the AA.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33459-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and lots of other,
I'll probably do a P&amp;</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33459-1
<v Ricky Horton>T or something like that.
And they just have to thank labor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33459-2
<v Ricky Horton>operation. That's it.
See one of these days it might get in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33459-3
<v Ricky Horton>here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33461-0
<v Ricky Horton>Keep on to your start.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33462-0
<v Ricky Horton>8.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33464-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't spend it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33465-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33494-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, it's set up. It's set up.
It doesn't show up on a line.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33537-0
<v Ricky Horton>That was here,
so 100 square feet per hour.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33537-1
<v Ricky Horton>So correct me if I'm wrong,
but this fabricated job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33537-2
<v Ricky Horton>So fabricated job that you was gonna have
unloaded and loaded and everything</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33537-3
<v Ricky Horton>included in that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33546-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if you paint on top of that,
are we building up on a load and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33546-1
<v Ricky Horton>unloading some of that in on that? No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33584-0
<v Ricky Horton>Receiving in the material,
moving it from the lay down of the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33584-1
<v Ricky Horton>process and take it out and then putting
it back to their finished.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33584-2
<v Ricky Horton>And then for us it's taking it from there,
putting it out, laying it out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33644-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then we got to put them in either the
contact points or depending on how it's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33644-1
<v Ricky Horton>got to get sprayed,
either depending on the material or what,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33644-2
<v Ricky Horton>what. OK,
is that what you get through print and if</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33644-3
<v Ricky Horton>we have to move from one station to the
other,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33644-4
<v Ricky Horton>so we have our own handling portion that
they don't have.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33678-0
<v Ricky Horton>Say we've got 100 square foot per hour
for the paint,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33678-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we need to add in load and unload.
I don't think so. We can add them in,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33678-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I'm not going to have any kind of
rates or quantities because it's all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33678-3
<v Ricky Horton>built into the paint and prep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33713-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if we add the men,
we can have the guy start tracking to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33713-1
<v Ricky Horton>that and then track an actual thing to
paint and see what that delta is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33713-2
<v Ricky Horton>We can do a,
we can do what's called a labor code</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33713-3
<v Ricky Horton>review, which just picks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33761-0
<v Ricky Horton>Labor and we could we could use the load
and unload that's already that they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33761-1
<v Ricky Horton>already using.
We say load and unload and paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33761-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's the only only three categories we
would get.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33761-3
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to do that at the beginning
because I already have 7.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33801-0
<v Ricky Horton>Rate production rate for my pain and my
prep and then I double up by adding</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33801-1
<v Ricky Horton>happened to it.
So you're putting the 100 square foot</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33801-2
<v Ricky Horton>dozen where you're standing there.
So at the end when they grow on the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33801-3
<v Ricky Horton>structural thing we are doubling up on if
it's a structural.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33837-0
<v Ricky Horton>If if we're going to fabricate the job,
it's going to include loaded and unloaded</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33837-1
<v Ricky Horton>in that.
So if the fabricated job they have their</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33837-2
<v Ricky Horton>own loaded bundle from receiving the
material in to processing it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33837-3
<v Ricky Horton>depending on what process they use until
they get it to their finished document.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33862-0
<v Ricky Horton>So if it's only a fast job,
they had done for all their voting,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33862-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's done. Yeah, I get that.
But what's exciting is to go to, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33899-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do you define load, unload, load,
unload the truck? Yeah, the truck,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33899-1
<v Ricky Horton>the truck comes in and I've got to unload
it and say you can find loads and loads.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33899-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think you can move that's that's my,
yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33927-0
<v Ricky Horton>So the the fabricators send you,
let's say show,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33927-1
<v Ricky Horton>show sends you a truck load steel and
somebody asked me that he's about to drop</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33927-2
<v Ricky Horton>seven days somewhere.
Is that account for the 100?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33964-0
<v Ricky Horton>Under script. OK,
so then should we in coding's only job</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33964-1
<v Ricky Horton>add more time for that?
If they're going to be tracking shipping</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33964-2
<v Ricky Horton>receiving signed two jobs,
I guess that'd be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33964-3
<v Ricky Horton>So then in that labor code you probably
want low.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/33974-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's one of the guy charges time to when
he unloads and coming on together.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34001-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you need to do that or I mean a lot of
times they'll charge the overhead and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34001-1
<v Ricky Horton>just spread that basket out across every
actual project for the year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34034-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. So it sounds like a pizza. Yeah.
Well, and you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34034-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not trying to re read the wheel.
I'm also part of that is when you go down,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34034-2
<v Ricky Horton>right.
If you're bidding it at 100 square feet</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34034-3
<v Ricky Horton>per hour, then we're having two beds.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34040-0
<v Ricky Horton>Screw you up and get all you making money
at it the way it is, you know, and so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34051-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then with the high school reference,
hit my mind to be there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34051-1
<v Ricky Horton>Some would consider it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34065-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, they just was too solid to ask.
It was going to like 8 or 10 assemblies.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34067-0
<v Ricky Horton>And there with this one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34074-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it was exported from this production
system, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34082-0
<v Ricky Horton>How does it benefit us to add the
handling code in there for our stuff and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34082-1
<v Ricky Horton>then load on load?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34083-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34122-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
the main thing is so when these get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34122-1
<v Ricky Horton>imported and it'll make more sense when
we look at it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34122-2
<v Ricky Horton>all of them are gonna be a code AD
associated with them,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34122-3
<v Ricky Horton>which is gonna be the default tab like
your code,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34122-4
<v Ricky Horton>which is gonna have material handling.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34156-0
<v Ricky Horton>And cutting to the length and everything
associated with running through</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34156-1
<v Ricky Horton>production.
What we need to do is create a tone to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34156-2
<v Ricky Horton>paint so we can globally edit all of the
assemblies so that they have paint code</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34156-3
<v Ricky Horton>which swirls.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34192-0
<v Ricky Horton>Take into account the coding system that
we have removed the production factors</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34192-1
<v Ricky Horton>and we need to make sure that we're
including a load and unload for shipping</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34192-2
<v Ricky Horton>side of it or do we not load and unload
for that side of it so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34220-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because it's definitely right now it's
gonna add material handling,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34220-1
<v Ricky Horton>load and unload,
cut to length and I think there's only</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34220-2
<v Ricky Horton>three cut size material handling load and
unload.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34232-0
<v Ricky Horton>With the standard game that's going to
associate with what I need, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34252-0
<v Ricky Horton>One of these things we'll be able to
check this out before today.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34252-1
<v Ricky Horton>I really estimated estimating all the
paint and all the handling we're talking</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34252-2
<v Ricky Horton>about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34272-0
<v Ricky Horton>Were they even using tech loaded to do
the rest of the material? No, no,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34272-1
<v Ricky Horton>they're all the spark foot is memory.
That's the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34303-0
<v Ricky Horton>But they're only pulling the square
footage number and applying one number to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34303-1
<v Ricky Horton>it. Yeah,
are they mainly tackling the square</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34303-2
<v Ricky Horton>footage?
I got we got a spreadsheet that has a lot</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34303-3
<v Ricky Horton>of stuff built into it.
Not everything on it works, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34306-0
<v Ricky Horton>We do some steel.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34330-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm able to use it for tanks.
That's right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34330-1
<v Ricky Horton>I've heard there's a they run it through
a program that automatically pulls off</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34330-2
<v Ricky Horton>sticks and it pulls off the square
footage based on the autonomy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34330-3
<v Ricky Horton>Is that correct?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34363-0
<v Ricky Horton>I know there are programs,
not this program. No,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34363-1
<v Ricky Horton>I know there are programs when going into
the drawings. It'll say, oh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34363-2
<v Ricky Horton>I got so many W 14, five, whatever,
so many WA,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34363-3
<v Ricky Horton>so many W 10 and it will calculate all
those.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34409-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you know the square footage
already and it prints it out and hands it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34409-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's kind of like that. Yeah.
And there there isn't a lot of companies</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34409-2
<v Ricky Horton>using that.
I assume that that they're using it here</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34409-3
<v Ricky Horton>because when I was talking the other day.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34463-0
<v Ricky Horton>This job we're going to be looking at,
they said, oh yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34463-1
<v Ricky Horton>automatically get all the stick down.
It's like you go to outside detailers and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34463-2
<v Ricky Horton>these outside detailers do that all day,
every day. They they sell an estimate,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34463-3
<v Ricky Horton>an estimation package to where you don't
say exactly how many sticks there are,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34463-4
<v Ricky Horton>which size and how many square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34492-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's happens all the time.
It's been happening for years.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34492-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I have to assume that and I have met
with our estimator,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34492-2
<v Ricky Horton>but I assume that that they're doing that.
So they already know the square footage</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34492-3
<v Ricky Horton>right now before they ever even go into
the program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34498-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's my assumption, but I I don't know.
No, not not for fillings.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34534-0
<v Ricky Horton>We have never used that.
And when we steal stuff like this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34534-1
<v Ricky Horton>we either go to Gavin or we go to Ron. OK,
hey, I need this information. But see,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34534-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think Ron, you really got the same.
I think he utilized the program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34556-0
<v Ricky Horton>I could be wrong.
I'm like as long as he's always trying to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34556-1
<v Ricky Horton>screw me. So I didn't shoot one.
I haven't even been up again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34556-2
<v Ricky Horton>Is the 95 cents a square foot good for
you? Give me a give me a break.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34556-3
<v Ricky Horton>I love that 95 cents a square foot is and
let me give you the price.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34587-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have an AI tool that works well for
structurally. That's right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34587-1
<v Ricky Horton>It it doesn't hang up as engineers
connections,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34587-2
<v Ricky Horton>as the connections in goes the model on a
workshop. It's unbelievable. What's that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34627-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's called COG.
I've actually developed and I was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34627-1
<v Ricky Horton>I was having to set up this and they
they're like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34627-2
<v Ricky Horton>we got to get set up to get work.
And they're like, well, let me show you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34627-3
<v Ricky Horton>So they built it and they're selling it
as of January 1st.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34647-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's on the label on shop,
so but now what's it's? What's it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34647-1
<v Ricky Horton>Was it grabbing it from PDF? PDF.
It's grabbing it from PDF. Yep, Yep,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34647-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's pretty great.
I'm sure it's pretty great.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34651-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's another one out there that's been
happening for a while called Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34660-0
<v Ricky Horton>Gosh, the software is called. Yep,
I'm trying to think of the company name.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34660-1
<v Ricky Horton>Um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34708-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know,
they've been out there for like a year or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34708-1
<v Ricky Horton>two probably, but they just do sticks.
They don't do connections. They do,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34708-2
<v Ricky Horton>they do columns and beams and you have to
tell it how big, how,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34708-3
<v Ricky Horton>how long the columns are,
whereas SkillG does it all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34708-4
<v Ricky Horton>It figures it all.
It's the top speed when figures it all.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34745-0
<v Ricky Horton>A lot longer than you can do with these
new programs. OK, yeah, the new programs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34745-1
<v Ricky Horton>I have never used them.
I've been hearing about them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34745-2
<v Ricky Horton>I've been in Arizona too. I just have.
Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm shocked.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34745-3
<v Ricky Horton>They're they're in vain right now,
probably about 28 months. I saw them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34764-0
<v Ricky Horton>20 of my clients on on the beta version
though right now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34764-1
<v Ricky Horton>but as of January 1st they're out,
it'll be automated in sale.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34764-2
<v Ricky Horton>I will take over the world when it comes
to the structural estimation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34765-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34768-0
<v Ricky Horton>It was loose.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34773-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it wasn't this night yesterday.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34790-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, we have gathered today.
This is the sweater's fault.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34790-1
<v Ricky Horton>I had three other councillors that didn't
want to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34791-0
<v Ricky Horton>That.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34828-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um,
I don't see any more promising than you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34828-1
<v Ricky Horton>want to. For her residence,
Josh would be doing, for example,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34828-2
<v Ricky Horton>like that. I think it wants to be.
Let's make one. Did Oxford building. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34828-3
<v Ricky Horton>he doesn't. It's probably getting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34839-0
<v Ricky Horton>You got 2 hours and 180 books to get this
****. Well, I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34839-1
<v Ricky Horton>you review all of yours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34862-0
<v Ricky Horton>All my jobs, you can, you can't do that.
Well, that's what I'm saying.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34862-1
<v Ricky Horton>So he's got to review all of them before
it's sent out. He was like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34863-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually something is asked.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34894-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sketch back to your left. Thank you.
There's coding involved.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34894-1
<v Ricky Horton>They're a little bit more mature,
but they they grew so quickly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34894-2
<v Ricky Horton>I think they quit developing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34923-0
<v Ricky Horton>What they're doing today is pretty much
what they've done in the past,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34923-1
<v Ricky Horton>which is columns and beams and no
connections.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34923-2
<v Ricky Horton>It does not be able to follow that and
then garnish. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34923-3
<v Ricky Horton>it looks like there's 5,
five of them just like that. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34923-4
<v Ricky Horton>but I don't see still taking.
They probably are not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34929-0
<v Ricky Horton>They are actually similar.
I'm sure if you want to see it, sure.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34930-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34940-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's anywhere over here,
it seems like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34953-0
<v Ricky Horton>All 13 entries.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34981-0
<v Ricky Horton>The last time you started,
you thought people down here,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34981-1
<v Ricky Horton>you would expect to go check.
This time I'll sit here and pick and work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/34981-2
<v Ricky Horton>He told me there was a dedicated gigabits.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35007-0
<v Ricky Horton>Line to the server.
I asked the question this morning for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35007-1
<v Ricky Horton>pipeline problem.
That's what I was wondering.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35007-2
<v Ricky Horton>He says it's barely using it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35023-0
<v Ricky Horton>But yeah,
we looked at all the all the surrounding</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35023-1
<v Ricky Horton>on there and it was not even barely
glipping.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35055-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because I thought it might be your pipe
is too small,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35055-1
<v Ricky Horton>like you had a one MB pipe and it says
you got gigabit pipe. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35055-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's barely even.
It's barely even anything you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35057-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not in my computer. That's in our server.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35062-0
<v Ricky Horton>I got.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35084-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do the beast.
The reason they actually took away my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35084-1
<v Ricky Horton>ability to install anything was because
this is a game.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35084-2
<v Ricky Horton>This thing runs to me about the tank's
like, you need more.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35102-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's good. Yeah, this one's my 3D model.
Honestly, it was called tech support.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35102-1
<v Ricky Horton>I have a 3D model.
I was like 40 people are running this on</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35102-2
<v Ricky Horton>this app.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35108-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's special requests.
I said I'd be good to this because I</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35108-1
<v Ricky Horton>wouldn't get any.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35136-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably not having the technology issues.
This is a beast.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35136-1
<v Ricky Horton>So they have a Ryzen 9 gear. I got a 4090.
I've got 64 gigabytes of RAM.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35136-2
<v Ricky Horton>This is single 10 standards.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35157-0
<v Ricky Horton>Who did you ask? That's OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35168-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's all I mean for the guys that do
heavy bottling,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35168-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we're really going through big models,
you know that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35199-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, what do you,
what do you go through the models with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35199-1
<v Ricky Horton>Intacla or do you use Natasource Intacla?
It's supposed to go to AutoCAD on my</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35199-2
<v Ricky Horton>computer. Also Atlantec software.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35215-0
<v Ricky Horton>They I get for 3D models of each art that
I'm processing and all the all the CNC</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35215-1
<v Ricky Horton>files are going to be at the end of
running.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35221-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hot cuts and weird intricacies, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35229-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just a while on this.
It's given this thing on for its money.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35271-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
we'll get rid of the I don't like the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35271-1
<v Ricky Horton>difference going to the.
So you say end up price control,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35271-2
<v Ricky Horton>go to price control,
just right from the grid. Dump that sale,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35271-3
<v Ricky Horton>probably import that sale,
see if there's anything different.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35272-0
<v Ricky Horton>2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35276-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should make a difference.
See you right for this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35296-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, all these fun ways I get,
they don't supply any files,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35296-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm manually import them in the new
storage as well and then we'll have an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35296-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate because I like make sure I can
take production a lot better than I try</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35296-3
<v Ricky Horton>to submit.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35322-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I checked to see if but still we're
doing this seems to be before when it was</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35322-1
<v Ricky Horton>completely frozen I couldn't even go and
go. So it's not it's server issue.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35322-2
<v Ricky Horton>It doesn't seem yeah but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35352-0
<v Ricky Horton>What space structural do you guys do
versus others? I think it's a good mix,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35352-1
<v Ricky Horton>but we got a lot of structural coming in
here for the last part of the year and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35352-2
<v Ricky Horton>the beginning of next year,
so the SMC coming up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35354-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's going to be a lot of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35362-0
<v Ricky Horton>So let's see what's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35402-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need a lot more backs up. You might.
I'm sure that I'll take off start for me</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35402-1
<v Ricky Horton>that you can tell us about any of that.
I have one that I have saved in my notes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35402-2
<v Ricky Horton>I can't remember if it was from the last
time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35429-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know how much the expectable cost.
I guess that we go behind this one say</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35429-1
<v Ricky Horton>from the last time we were here.
I don't know how much we are jeans.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35429-2
<v Ricky Horton>Super expensive, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35436-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's fine. If it's, I'm here 40% of a uh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35481-0
<v Ricky Horton>Basically it's my salary. So if I can,
if I can and I'm here that you,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35481-1

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35481-2
<v Ricky Horton>they're saying they were getting out
about three times the estimates.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35481-3
<v Ricky Horton>So if I can spend 40% of an estimator
salary to get three times more estimates,</v>

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/35505-1
<v Ricky Horton>especially when we get some of these 3000
ton periods that are due the next day.</v>

a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36375-0
<v Ricky Horton>Although Task Manager did his.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36386-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is what CPU is moving on.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36404-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's not.
Do you have Internet connection?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36404-1
<v Ricky Horton>I know you're hard wired in.
Are you getting? You're on a test,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36404-2
<v Ricky Horton>you get something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36440-0
<v Ricky Horton>And can you tell the number of users we
talked to? Yeah, yeah, if it's,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36440-1
<v Ricky Horton>if it's not,
I'll give you next to this brief.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36440-2
<v Ricky Horton>I was having people whoever's left in and
somebody else could be running some</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36440-3
<v Ricky Horton>ridiculous thing in the background.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36460-0
<v Ricky Horton>So even then, when we've had 15 months,
we're all actively showing on that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36460-1
<v Ricky Horton>And we're going to have some, you know,
hundreds of employees and.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36476-0
<v Ricky Horton>No issue. Well,
it's just listing every operation,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36476-1
<v Ricky Horton>probably.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36480-0
<v Ricky Horton>Wow, it receptor you do now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36482-0
<v Ricky Horton>Here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36507-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's really not too tall for you to.
Everybody, everybody thinks it. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36507-1
<v Ricky Horton>I also think we should create another
estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36521-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go into that current estimate and push
your life lever to another estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36521-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can do that. We're getting better.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36544-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see, I'm guessing.
What's the main problem? It's like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36544-1
<v Ricky Horton>oh my God, here it is.
No shipping or receiving, you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's that's.
What are you talking about this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36561-0
<v Ricky Horton>How many personalities are you behind?
Yes, you know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36573-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you could then put it into another
estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36573-1
<v Ricky Horton>You'd have to have estimates for you
though.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36579-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let this go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36584-0
<v Ricky Horton>9 minutes listening.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36603-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what's the thing? Where? Where are you?
I think they should get that's funny</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36603-1
<v Ricky Horton>times before endos, right? Yeah,
only the other day.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36626-0
<v Ricky Horton>He's like, oh,
all the boys and the triple trucks out</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36626-1
<v Ricky Horton>here. I'm like, whoa, that's our seat.
I mean, he's awesome. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36626-2
<v Ricky Horton>what about the straight metal now?
Awesome.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36641-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know where the logs do in here in the
default? Yeah, let's open it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36641-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's an error login layer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36651-0
<v Ricky Horton>To change it, switch everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36657-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let me see that. See that.
Let's see where we're at.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36661-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, I have to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36675-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we've got according up with you.
You can tell a play on that while, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36675-1
<v Ricky Horton>Just anywhere in the white there, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36681-0
<v Ricky Horton>Not sure which one.
Open one of those top two.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36690-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh yeah, the way at the bottom.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36691-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36692-0
<v Ricky Horton>And.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36695-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like the matrix. Excuse.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36696-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36701-0
<v Ricky Horton>This is what's the database.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36716-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I see. So, but let's cycle.
Let's do entertainment.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36725-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it's like getting a lot of stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36734-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
the record law is kind of what we're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36734-1
<v Ricky Horton>getting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36738-0
<v Ricky Horton>Walkway.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36741-0
<v Ricky Horton>And if I move at 12, take on a second.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36747-0
<v Ricky Horton>This I'm gonna sounds,
so what's up will be?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36750-0
<v Ricky Horton>Open.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36751-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36753-0
<v Ricky Horton>I just can't do it. What?
Can you do a little motion?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36762-0
<v Ricky Horton>So this is my God. That is what this is.
It's every single.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36775-0
<v Ricky Horton>Go to another.
Let's see what's in the end.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36775-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not sure what the difference is
between 22 megabytes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36779-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's huge problematic, except.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36781-0
<v Ricky Horton>Application is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36789-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm thinking something's wrong with.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36790-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36799-0
<v Ricky Horton>And which means what? Bad install? Maybe.
I don't know. I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36816-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm I'm not not T gas.
I'm I'm just I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36816-1
<v Ricky Horton>I know that this were happening anywhere
else. Tecla would be just, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36816-2
<v Ricky Horton>down there. They would be, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36818-0
<v Ricky Horton>I mean that that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36829-0
<v Ricky Horton>If I were shooting from my hip,
I'd if I'd reinstall a signal in the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36830-0
<v Ricky Horton>See this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36835-0
<v Ricky Horton>So really.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36845-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hello.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36847-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36848-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36849-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36867-0
<v Ricky Horton>It is. I think that's the problem.
I shouldn't. I can't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36867-1
<v Ricky Horton>This biology here wants to be treated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36869-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36870-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36881-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll reply back and everything looks good.
Yeah, you're call prospects.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36881-1
<v Ricky Horton>You want to call on the against the Green
Rover.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36899-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
little bumping model wasn't even there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36899-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's only we said I'm coming tomorrow and
that's the old thing. No, that's not how.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36903-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't see what your issue is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36908-0
<v Ricky Horton>Spock me a little box.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36914-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's the difference between sitting
there and sitting at home?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36914-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to be active with anybody.
What's he gonna do?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36919-0
<v Ricky Horton>It shouldn't be now.
It's not lost in your house.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36919-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's reasonable place.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36935-0
<v Ricky Horton>You'll never have to give me a ride.
I want somebody to go over once you get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36935-1
<v Ricky Horton>home. Just leave on the left door anymore.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36936-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36954-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess something we can mess around with
is labor units.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36954-1
<v Ricky Horton>You have any things that are going in
there? Yeah, yeah, let's try it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36960-0
<v Ricky Horton>Since everything else,
someone's just giving us relief.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/36971-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37016-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have to speak to come tomorrow for
electrical and efficient and working with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37016-1
<v Ricky Horton>the new home.
And that's one thing I need to follow is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37016-2
<v Ricky Horton>to see if they actually successfully
created that secondary.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37016-3
<v Ricky Horton>As of this morning,
it didn't sound like it. Talk to me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37016-4
<v Ricky Horton>Then we're going to have to push that
home.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37049-0
<v Ricky Horton>The whole operation. We need to.
We probably should find out in the next</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37049-1
<v Ricky Horton>half an hour or so. I mean,
we can send out a message. Well, don't,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37049-2
<v Ricky Horton>don't tell them this,
but if worse things are worse,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37049-3
<v Ricky Horton>so I can pray to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37071-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then if we'd like to be,
we can transfer that to the original</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37071-1
<v Ricky Horton>later day, such as the bill. So, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37084-0
<v Ricky Horton>Guess we're going to have to make one for.
Yeah, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37084-1
<v Ricky Horton>So what do you want to call them? OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37086-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sounds good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37101-0
<v Ricky Horton>So then, yeah,
this goes back to the question,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37101-1
<v Ricky Horton>do we leave unload and load in there and
then we.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37102-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just make and pay and make everything
else out. I'm going to do with just that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37137-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, we keep the load.
So they have pretty much the reserved.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37137-1
<v Ricky Horton>Well, not dollar values the same,
but I guess it's just quite amount of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37137-2
<v Ricky Horton>time. So yeah,
it's based on the calculations and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37137-3
<v Ricky Horton>basically materialized.
So we went to that labor of our.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37168-0
<v Ricky Horton>One man hour per 100 square foot against
the hingles being made,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37168-1
<v Ricky Horton>all of those associated.
Now when we go into if we can ever get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37168-2
<v Ricky Horton>you one of these sesame,
we'll apply this clean labor code to all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37168-3
<v Ricky Horton>the items and then we'll remove.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37217-0
<v Ricky Horton>All time and it'll remove anything
associated with production and it'll just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37217-1
<v Ricky Horton>keep the coding stuff.
So default with our production is it has</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37217-2
<v Ricky Horton>the loading on the load assuming reading
which they're building material out and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37217-3
<v Ricky Horton>then coding to throw on top of that and
having both in there with it being coding.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37217-4
<v Ricky Horton>So only we're trying to figure out should.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37256-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should we take the load and unknown
aspect out or should it be included and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37256-1
<v Ricky Horton>then just scrub the production aspects
out? Well, here's what I don't like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37256-2
<v Ricky Horton>at least at the beginning is I want to be
able to see them because I'm trying to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37256-3
<v Ricky Horton>recording the production out there to see
those base coats,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37256-4
<v Ricky Horton>I guess you can call them,
but I don't want to talk about.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37303-0
<v Ricky Horton>I assigned to it to where it bumps my
price up until I track it up out there to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37303-1
<v Ricky Horton>see what it actually how much I can take
off of my pay and put it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37303-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you want the you don't want any any
cost on it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37303-3
<v Ricky Horton>but it's only cost on the pay side of it,
yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37334-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just give you that visibility.
You don't necessarily have to apply the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37334-1
<v Ricky Horton>lease to it because you'll still get your
square footage and your your paint labor.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37334-2
<v Ricky Horton>So these will be in separate buckets of
the load and unload and you can make</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37334-3
<v Ricky Horton>justifications that's gonna put you over
the cost.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37342-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or that something like that would be,
yeah, we can.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37381-0
<v Ricky Horton>But if we leave it as he is,
it's going to put it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37381-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's going to apply the same labor rate
to those hours as it would for the pain.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37381-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I mean,
we could set it up to do it differently.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37407-0
<v Ricky Horton>We we have to set up, do operations,
apply those times to it and apply it to a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37407-1
<v Ricky Horton>labor rate of 0.
It'll take some setting up and some doing,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37407-2
<v Ricky Horton>but we can do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37412-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you see the hours, but no dollars.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37456-0
<v Ricky Horton>Might muddy the water a little bit in
some areas of the system,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37456-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it'll show you the total hours of
everything and then whatever the cost is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37456-2
<v Ricky Horton>it would only be reflective of the paint
time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37456-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it might muddy the water to look like
it's less than what you expected to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37480-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we'd like, why not do this $13 a half,
right? Or something like that. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37480-1
<v Ricky Horton>Will that affect the production skills
and won't affect the production safety?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37480-2
<v Ricky Horton>Now we're building it separate. So yeah,
it might just look weird on the estimate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37480-3
<v Ricky Horton>in some areas too.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37497-0
<v Ricky Horton>I had 100 hours and probably $45
associated with it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37497-1
<v Ricky Horton>so I'm picking it straight into the
battery, but you know it was weird.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37497-2
<v Ricky Horton>Do you want to set it up that way?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37536-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you you wanted to make sure I'm I'm
right in explaining this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37536-1
<v Ricky Horton>You wanted the hour,
you wanted to see the hours for late and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37536-2
<v Ricky Horton>unloaded but not have a cost associated
with it, is that correct?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes,
but so that's just so I understand this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-1
<v Ricky Horton>correctly. If you have loading unload,
you already have a production factor</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-2
<v Ricky Horton>based what what's the load on what?
So pay is based off of square feet per</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-3
<v Ricky Horton>hour. What's the load based off of?
It's not square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-4
<v Ricky Horton>Is it bounce per hour?
Is it it's probably unless you change it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37591-5
<v Ricky Horton>out of the boxes,
the extrapolation I can find by the light.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37605-0
<v Ricky Horton>And it's got just like the paint,
the it says somebody did it for that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37605-1
<v Ricky Horton>so it's probably based off of the length.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37616-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then going forward,
we're going to put shipping and receiving</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37616-1
<v Ricky Horton>time towards jobs.
Is that how they're going to track it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37647-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then yeah, then again,
I'd like to see what it allocates for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37647-1
<v Ricky Horton>hours, but I have a zero dollar value. OK,
reason I said I don't want to cost myself</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37647-2
<v Ricky Horton>out of general. So yeah,
we can do a labor code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37654-0
<v Ricky Horton>Paint with just paint and we can do a
labor for the paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37674-0
<v Ricky Horton>Remember,
we just keep talking about walking down</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37674-1
<v Ricky Horton>the bench and then make bigger changes.
I will. Yeah, that would be easier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37715-0
<v Ricky Horton>From this, from today's standpoint, yeah,
I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37715-1
<v Ricky Horton>we could give it so that we can have a
separate rate board and we'll have that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37715-2
<v Ricky Horton>as zero,
they will take building operations for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37715-3
<v Ricky Horton>each one. A little bit of doors. I think,
right. I think maybe for now,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37715-4
<v Ricky Horton>let's see what it does and then if we
want to go to that, we'll go to that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37716-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37720-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37721-0
<v Ricky Horton>So it's like you're speaking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37726-0
<v Ricky Horton>Elements.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37732-0
<v Ricky Horton>Mhm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37763-0
<v Ricky Horton>So Curtis might have to say based off of
what he sees based off of that or</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37763-1
<v Ricky Horton>textbook.
He says somebody has and it looks like it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37763-2
<v Ricky Horton>might be gabbing.
I'm not gabbing but Mark.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37771-0
<v Ricky Horton>As there's a table locked up by Hughes
and so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37791-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think our reboots probably will fix
that, but I I can't. That's weird.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37791-1
<v Ricky Horton>I just he's not even wanted to use to
plug in. Yeah, I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37804-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I don't know.
Now he's guessing for that one thing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37804-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're looking at, so yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37805-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37806-0
<v Ricky Horton>It.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37811-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's him as a matter of fact. Hey.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37813-0
<v Ricky Horton>What you up to?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37848-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we're we've got where we we try to import</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37848-1
<v Ricky Horton>a kiss file into estimating.
We try to import a Excel file into</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37848-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimating. We try to create an estimate,
just create it from scratch and that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37852-0
<v Ricky Horton>It locks up every single time. Yeah, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37866-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. We'll go and look. And it's,
by the way, it's not just estimated.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37876-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
we'll have to get out to you to do that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37876-1
<v Ricky Horton>Gary.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37882-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not. They exactly.
They're not all of the convenience.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37899-0
<v Ricky Horton>Actually, no. Nothing's yellow. No, no,
nothing's yellow.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37899-1
<v Ricky Horton>So there was a bunch of stuff that rained
earlier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37905-0
<v Ricky Horton>What's published in the or either later,
but um.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37906-0
<v Ricky Horton>Help them good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37914-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, no,
they aren't moving at the moment, so, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37922-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK,
so you you think just restart the remote</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37922-1
<v Ricky Horton>server or?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37926-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK. OK. Yeah, OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37927-0
<v Ricky Horton>Logan.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37948-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know.
We were struggling with this. I mean,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37948-1
<v Ricky Horton>we were struggling with some stuff
yesterday,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37948-2
<v Ricky Horton>but we weren't struggling with this.
But yeah, we have a lot of snacks. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37953-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really. Who's fast? It's like, no.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37957-0
<v Ricky Horton>I guess that would be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37958-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37959-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37961-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should run smooth.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37980-0
<v Ricky Horton>I can give it to be remembered to be,
yeah, nothing, nothing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37980-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's the thought.
Is everybody else like kind of like?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37984-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Well, they don't be pretty. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37986-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's fine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37991-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/37993-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38003-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll give it a shot and I'll let you
know what happens.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38009-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's it. See you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38031-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, he thinks,
he thinks restarting the SQL service is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38031-1
<v Ricky Horton>gonna, which is just, you know,
he thinks that's fine for Lisa and be</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38031-2
<v Ricky Horton>better, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38061-0
<v Ricky Horton>Never miss Keith and give a shot.
That's the thing is the duplication</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38061-1
<v Ricky Horton>process should be like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38088-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it's actually taking since last
Thursday to then duplicate the status and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38088-1
<v Ricky Horton>they're doing some. Yeah,
there are there's a deeper issue from</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38088-2
<v Ricky Horton>then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38092-0
<v Ricky Horton>With three days.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38105-0
<v Ricky Horton>We duplicate three times over so we can
just have three quorums.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38113-0
<v Ricky Horton>You know, all that goes.
We'll try to do the same thing myself,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38113-1
<v Ricky Horton>but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38119-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't want to disconnect.
They don't do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38121-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, I mean, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38128-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to get to that, go back.
I need to put them in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38128-1
<v Ricky Horton>We will have you play for us too,
then we play round three.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38130-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38131-0
<v Ricky Horton>At home.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38133-0
<v Ricky Horton>So but I mean.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38139-0
<v Ricky Horton>We just have to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38147-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38165-0
<v Ricky Horton>Even if it's all the walls and see if
they can see something for something,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38165-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's obviously true.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38167-0
<v Ricky Horton>Please, please.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38170-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, especially if you're about to do this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38174-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38176-0
<v Ricky Horton>All right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38183-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's try and break this thing again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38191-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we got a response from Keith.
It's the meeting, meeting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38201-0
<v Ricky Horton>Holy crap.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38204-0
<v Ricky Horton>Maybe something, right?
So I'll take it different one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38205-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
I heard we're trying to work on this.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38205-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm doing something better.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38211-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, and then they're all OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38213-0
<v Ricky Horton>The task set probably is there here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38226-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's sure what you're doing.
I'm sorry. Hey, were you sleeping?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38226-1
<v Ricky Horton>So I guess.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38227-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's not anybody in the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38228-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's about the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38231-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm putting that thing in there.
We couldn't get any of the.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38233-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, thousand it is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38234-0
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38244-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's not up. All right.
This time it was 'cause I'm moving too</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38244-1
<v Ricky Horton>fast.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38245-0
<v Ricky Horton>What is this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38269-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think you're ******* sweating. You know,
I don't think managed you're not anything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38269-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's fine. You're not *******.
I'm feeling pretty red roll over here now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38269-2
<v Ricky Horton>Getting hold up. No, I'm not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38278-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah. Oh, look at that. Perfect up. Yeah,
I'm gonna.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38293-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, not a risky to do that. There we go.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38327-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, we can test every resource,
but none of our fee systems we just had</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38327-1
<v Ricky Horton>in here and because we copied it from
this and that was all what we did the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38327-2
<v Ricky Horton>other day. So but we can test it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38329-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38341-0
<v Ricky Horton>You can just recreate the things right
here to make a match.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38364-0
<v Ricky Horton>Are the what about the quantities on the
paints and the cost of the paint?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38371-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, it's a big one time.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38373-0
<v Ricky Horton>Very good. Awful.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38381-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, and the square footage of watches.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38385-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38387-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's a message.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38399-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I understand you're beating the door,
but we want it to be something.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38399-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think that thing this was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38425-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think it was 4 and four.
I don't think we had anything done with</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38425-1
<v Ricky Horton>that.
The thickness percade was different than</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38425-2
<v Ricky Horton>the dental thickness. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. There's not one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38425-3
<v Ricky Horton>I got a few.
I will start mixing that ****.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38483-0
<v Ricky Horton>130 gallons.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38487-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38489-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38490-0
<v Ricky Horton>It one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38491-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know. I don't know. So it's an.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38492-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right. Yeah, we get the settings.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38496-0
<v Ricky Horton>Probably something in estimation rating.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38498-0
<v Ricky Horton>No.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38499-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, it's a very much.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38500-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's really good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38512-0
<v Ricky Horton>The second loss in the instance.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38517-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK, I didn't see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38528-0
<v Ricky Horton>Sorry, sorry, sorry. I think there's no.
We may,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38528-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you know what I see is in the box.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38534-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's correct. Oh, it shouldn't be. Yeah,
it's positive.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38537-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, but yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38538-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38555-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, we're still preparing time.
This one I can explain at any point where</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38555-1
<v Ricky Horton>they have we got to get burned out out
there. So go to a piece of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38573-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just double click on one of them.
Just click anywhere on opposition based</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38573-1
<v Ricky Horton>over on the left and go to label codes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38583-0
<v Ricky Horton>And for plate here again,
the formula says get rid of the burning</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38583-1
<v Ricky Horton>here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38603-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's due to quality maintenance, yeah,
and then all you're going to and you're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38603-1
<v Ricky Horton>probably supposing that for the other
paint like as well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38618-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is that from an estimate extra or
something? That's weird. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38618-1
<v Ricky Horton>I think you've not paid.
You can just the one blend it to the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38618-2
<v Ricky Horton>estimate extra. So just clear it out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38621-0
<v Ricky Horton>This.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38627-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're looking for, right?
Yeah, this is work too. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38627-1
<v Ricky Horton>you know what I mean?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38632-0
<v Ricky Horton>This one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38645-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes, so for this one.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38648-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38677-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah,
135 COVID hours estimated for this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38677-1
<v Ricky Horton>originally I would have about 70 hours
currently 1208 dollars.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38677-2
<v Ricky Horton>What we have in calculations is doing is
231 points.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38679-0
<v Ricky Horton>At 75%.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38680-0
<v Ricky Horton>They were about 100% towards that focus.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38710-0
<v Ricky Horton>So just so I get this straight,
you guys estimated 70% efficiency, 75,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38710-1
<v Ricky Horton>75% of efficiency on again,
all your jobs are within 2% of your</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38710-2
<v Ricky Horton>audience. It was yesterday a conversation.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38737-0
<v Ricky Horton>If, but we've been asking on networks,
we we set up the so we've never tweaked</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38737-1
<v Ricky Horton>that in the report.
So any of the things that we've made to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38737-2
<v Ricky Horton>labor have been.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38764-0
<v Ricky Horton>I feel that it's at least my job to make
it a bus or they make it public.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38764-1
<v Ricky Horton>That sounds more realistic than what we
really have to do. That's about legacy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38764-2
<v Ricky Horton>It's not much reports yesterday, though,
and all freaking right on that task.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38764-3
<v Ricky Horton>I can get an hour or two.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38766-0
<v Ricky Horton>173.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38768-0
<v Ricky Horton>Look for JF 6300 for a meeting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38773-0
<v Ricky Horton>They only gave me 70. Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38789-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I submitted. So we'll have 173,
but that's just, this is just paying,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38789-1
<v Ricky Horton>right? It's putting just, yeah,
our estimate is pro for it would be about</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38789-2
<v Ricky Horton>120 total.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38791-0
<v Ricky Horton>I need to process that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38828-0
<v Ricky Horton>Let's get the owners. Yeah,
to leave all your the hours that you gave</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38828-1
<v Ricky Horton>for the paint,
the paint that we put in earlier.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38828-2
<v Ricky Horton>Instead of using the 75%,
we'd have to use 100%,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38828-3
<v Ricky Horton>but they're going to continue to use 75%.
So you have to adjust those hours down to</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38828-4
<v Ricky Horton>get them to the right hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38853-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're found right. Yep, yes.
And we'll compute it on the fab.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38853-1
<v Ricky Horton>You can't.
You're going to change the efficiency</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38853-2
<v Ricky Horton>rate on the whole. Yes, you are.
So if you have fab, if you do a fab of 75.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38855-0
<v Ricky Horton>Throw off.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38885-0
<v Ricky Horton>But we have to. Yeah,
our average was to the 7,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38885-1
<v Ricky Horton>but I think it was still 70% of 100 we
got to do. It's still high.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38913-0
<v Ricky Horton>Percentage. So yeah, honestly,
we need the we need population.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38913-1
<v Ricky Horton>We're still still need to think.
I've got to change the balance and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38913-2
<v Ricky Horton>increase. Yeah, so if you have 100%,
you're up to what we're right where</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38913-3
<v Ricky Horton>you're supposed to be and then.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38932-0
<v Ricky Horton>Adjusting. We're on.
You're adjusting one number. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38932-1
<v Ricky Horton>and the 2025 is to be one,
but that's all the ******* impact.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38932-2
<v Ricky Horton>They've been using it 75%, basically.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38960-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or the Excel file is estimating and as on
the import we get to the city where.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38976-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's let compare.
If we we definitely tried then we have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38976-1
<v Ricky Horton>language and convenience.
Let's lock it up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38987-0
<v Ricky Horton>Just it's not necessarily in this the way
you get outside this person,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38987-1
<v Ricky Horton>not possible a lot of the new one place.
I would get it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38987-2
<v Ricky Horton>It should actually be good for any sort
of supports of you where it was.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38987-3
<v Ricky Horton>We're having those options.
Everyone's time it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38988-0
<v Ricky Horton>They want to hear back. I don't know why.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/38993-0
<v Ricky Horton>We did there. We don't understand.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39020-0
<v Ricky Horton>Feel like we need everything. Yeah,
that they're gonna,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39020-1
<v Ricky Horton>we're going to have to fit their IT
involved.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39027-0
<v Ricky Horton>We can't even solve it. Yeah, e-mail.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39061-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
we'll just try install the patch and then</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39061-1
<v Ricky Horton>we'll see if it see what it was and then
if not, then I'll scream back at you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39063-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39094-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is is this?
Is there some sort of node issue with it?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39094-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just thinking when I go to another
slide next week, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39094-2
<v Ricky Horton>there's something I need to be watching
for. Is there another issue?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39095-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39098-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that's really good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39119-0
<v Ricky Horton>I knew that we have seen it. This is good.
So that's pretty. That was true.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39119-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll get into it,
but obviously I'll stay on page 51.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39119-2
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you. Appreciate it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39125-0
<v Ricky Horton>How long? Like 810 days? 10 minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39149-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm impressive. Well,
thanks for what makes me. What?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39149-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's he agreed to? It shows. It shows.
I don't have to be mentioning where else.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39149-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you have to build when you say yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39152-0
<v Ricky Horton>But I needed it all like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39190-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
They said the first 7 truck loads.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39190-1
<v Ricky Horton>They were part.
That's the part of the chat. It's like,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39190-2
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not going to let them talk and he's
going to give me a price. It was, oh,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39190-3
<v Ricky Horton>you were copying on there.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39227-0
<v Ricky Horton>$7.00 like 33,000 foot feet.
My parents start off loading steel.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39227-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't get it.
We process that and we're just like, hey,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39227-2
<v Ricky Horton>you can handle more if I do.
I got a job to get this **** done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39227-3
<v Ricky Horton>You want me to do it,
so I'll be able to make it and it's all</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39227-4
<v Ricky Horton>over my back.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39249-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll just send the price and send it to
30 grand.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39273-0
<v Ricky Horton>Bigger as I already have to.
The truck was offloaded and was walking</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39273-1
<v Ricky Horton>steel on steel. Well,
there was more handling,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39273-2
<v Ricky Horton>more trucking built down since six.
They went out in eight trucks. But yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39273-3
<v Ricky Horton>after that I think back from them.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39274-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's very.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39287-0
<v Ricky Horton>I was gonna say I had to go back to
building, building. I can't.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39291-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, that is not any difference,
but I think taking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39304-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's 78 objects. Well,
it was 173 to 190.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39321-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh, sounds like it's working.
So you're drastically different with us</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39321-1
<v Ricky Horton>at all, especially when it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39344-0
<v Ricky Horton>So, so how, how would we,
how would we hire them if we put in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39344-1
<v Ricky Horton>hundreds for the graph?
That's that's what I'm.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39364-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because of what we've got,
what's the square footage?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39364-1
<v Ricky Horton>Square footage on this one is 636694.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39393-0
<v Ricky Horton>Don't worry about 100%,
we should figure that 20% wasn't coming</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39393-1
<v Ricky Horton>down. So that's at least 63, yeah, 63.6.
He's not even here right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39393-2
<v Ricky Horton>Make sure we're after that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39416-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's true.
So we always should be getting all of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39416-1
<v Ricky Horton>that. So we we did what you said.
We put two different paints on this thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39421-0
<v Ricky Horton>So and so that should be getting us under
20 hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39457-0
<v Ricky Horton>For the smart village, how many?
How much are all of this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39457-1
<v Ricky Horton>We need about two.
So there's a prime intermediate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39457-2
<v Ricky Horton>essentially.
So that would be about 6000 square feet.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39457-3
<v Ricky Horton>That would be 100. So that's much closer.
I thought it was just.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39477-0
<v Ricky Horton>From that thing. OK, well, yeah, no,
there's too much. OK, cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39477-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'm figuring that 10 hour dolphins maybe
for the offload and offload. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39477-2
<v Ricky Horton>that's certainly. Yeah, it looks right.
That's the end coming. She does. Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39478-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's your support.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39493-0
<v Ricky Horton>I had that word.
I had that word about that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39493-1
<v Ricky Horton>I'll love that.
You'll be there in a few minutes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39493-2
<v Ricky Horton>You wouldn't know. OK, you wouldn't know.
So I'm going to do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39494-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll speak to that.
So there'll be no help. OK, fine.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39494-1
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39500-0
<v Ricky Horton>So I estimate we're not having it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39503-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yes.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39509-0
<v Ricky Horton>See what I got here. Uh,
how much big is it talking idea I guess?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39514-0
<v Ricky Horton>How much? What was?
How much pain material?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39531-0
<v Ricky Horton>52 gallons. Look at this shot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39553-0
<v Ricky Horton>25,467 lbs and 47 cents. All right,
so that's the thing we got. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39553-1
<v Ricky Horton>we got to do.
We got to put the minimum on the abrasive</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39553-2
<v Ricky Horton>that $4400.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39556-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm trying to.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39599-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's 25,000. Yeah,
you said it's over the 40. No, I don't,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39599-1
<v Ricky Horton>but it's 25,467. That's still a partial.
So all you're saying it needs to be,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39599-2
<v Ricky Horton>it needs to be a full.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39604-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what is that 25 or 67? Yep.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39614-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's like 5.8 bags.
I need to get 6 bags.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39616-0
<v Ricky Horton>But at points explorer.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39630-0
<v Ricky Horton>Based on the calculations for that,
I'm thinking about,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39630-1
<v Ricky Horton>but the minimum has to be about that,
yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39663-0
<v Ricky Horton>Dude,
once we figure out how we can do that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39663-1
<v Ricky Horton>tell us if it just shoots it out and then
we can wrap it up. Well,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39663-2
<v Ricky Horton>if it's building an estimate then then
that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39663-3
<v Ricky Horton>So here's here's what I don't want to
have if it starts giving me all these.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39682-0
<v Ricky Horton>Note this.
Then I have to go over and manually</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39682-1
<v Ricky Horton>figure out how to place this product.
You know this last isn't how long I have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39682-2
<v Ricky Horton>to go back and redo it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39695-0
<v Ricky Horton>Make it work as another pain because it's
figuring certain certain amount per</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39695-1
<v Ricky Horton>square foot.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39710-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shoot, it's going to figure it out. No,
we can do it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39710-1
<v Ricky Horton>We can kind of figure it has another pain
and stand and use that brand left finger.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39718-0
<v Ricky Horton>What?
What do you need is rent update 4400?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39765-0
<v Ricky Horton>4400 it's every minimum water. OK,
so let's see. So when I when I get sent,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39765-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's either by the truck load,
which has 10 super sacks on it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39765-2
<v Ricky Horton>but he said is 2 tons.
I can get them on consignment and get</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39765-3
<v Ricky Horton>them charge jobs per day.
So it's either be 4400 or 88 tons.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39768-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39771-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're not able to do that without
painting.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39804-0
<v Ricky Horton>It won't show up right there.
It's going to show up as another one as a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39804-1
<v Ricky Horton>paint, basically. But I think we might.
But that's really the price of your last</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39804-2
<v Ricky Horton>media in relationship to your price we
were paying per job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39831-0
<v Ricky Horton>Last media is even more.
It's hugely more not right now.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39831-1
<v Ricky Horton>So we did the central right span paying
for the inside was about 12,500,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39831-2
<v Ricky Horton>last media was about 17,000 I think.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39836-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right there, it's for five times.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39840-0
<v Ricky Horton>For the micro proxy.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39842-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39858-0
<v Ricky Horton>But as what's the matter when you got
those two kind of lots going on in the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39858-1
<v Ricky Horton>whole system?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39864-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just not used to seeing those big
numbers for last week.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39873-0
<v Ricky Horton>There's pain.
Maybe I just am not sensitive to it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39883-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, well,
I don't understand because that's what</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39883-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're getting, but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39931-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm just saying, well,
we might need some of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39931-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's always been a point of discussion of
should we charge,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39931-2
<v Ricky Horton>should we charge for the full amount of
media that we need when we've taken</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39931-3
<v Ricky Horton>effect that we're using recycle sand and
pot out here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39947-0
<v Ricky Horton>But at the same time, if I went out,
if I can only recycle like two or three</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39947-1
<v Ricky Horton>times,
if I don't have field jobs using garment,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39947-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't recycle ship.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39959-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's always going to be that's why
I'm not sensitive to it because we use</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39959-1
<v Ricky Horton>steel grid and get 200 turns out of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39961-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, it's a big difference.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39983-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'll think it will take the race and make
it 0.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39983-1
<v Ricky Horton>Let's get a let's get a pin first so you
can set it up where it functions whether</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/39983-2
<v Ricky Horton>it'll take it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40050-0
<v Ricky Horton>So what I'm thinking is we have to put in,
yeah, we don't need,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40050-1
<v Ricky Horton>we don't need to worry about rounding up
size that kind of functions as we don't</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40050-2
<v Ricky Horton>need to round it up. Yeah,
we're not going to round up on because</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40050-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're just using this for the shop stuff,
whatever we get it,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40050-4
<v Ricky Horton>we'll recycle them what we use.
So it's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40069-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's back.
It's back's not gonna throw the pop.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40069-1
<v Ricky Horton>So it's fun where it is. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
It's for the field,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40069-2
<v Ricky Horton>but they only use the view. OK, OK, cool.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40091-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you know how much we used to steal
shop place? Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40091-1
<v Ricky Horton>but they didn't get a plan.
That's what we need to do.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40091-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's what we're doing. They both guys.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40101-0
<v Ricky Horton>Did the bank look about right there as
far as the product you'd expect to see</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40101-1
<v Ricky Horton>going back up?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40102-0
<v Ricky Horton>OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40103-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, that's OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40117-0
<v Ricky Horton>Hey, what's happening? Let's see what?
Is it October? That's like a freeze.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40117-1
<v Ricky Horton>We'll see the actual quantity of paint.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40131-0
<v Ricky Horton>52 gallons, 52 gallons,
45 door type of steel sped.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40145-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's very well square feet.
It's 122 gallons, 122 square feet,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40145-1
<v Ricky Horton>excuse me.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40152-0
<v Ricky Horton>Per gallon. So we're saying 140.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40153-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40157-0
<v Ricky Horton>Should be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40158-0
<v Ricky Horton>Good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40184-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, yeah, it's grounding up too.
Let's not forget that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40184-1
<v Ricky Horton>What's what's this worth?
What about 63 hundred 6366?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40186-0
<v Ricky Horton>Then pull up that screenshot again.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40189-0
<v Ricky Horton>141.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40197-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's 50.9. So yeah,
that's 52 gallons on that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40206-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40219-0
<v Ricky Horton>So when you quote that coverage,
no matter here, carrying waste, 50% waste.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40236-0
<v Ricky Horton>Is the is the dollar amount per hour the
same for structural and he does as well?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40257-0
<v Ricky Horton>It's at 65 labour rate. Yeah, right.
It's different. It should be different.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40257-1
<v Ricky Horton>Job working shop and it was shop.
What's you guys labor rate 65?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40258-0
<v Ricky Horton>It should have it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40282-0
<v Ricky Horton>No,
we charge with the big boots charger and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40282-1
<v Ricky Horton>the little boy shop. Yeah, exactly. OK.
But it isn't different. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40282-2
<v Ricky Horton>we go either 55 or 60.
It depends on the program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40288-0
<v Ricky Horton>Brichelle, it's not right on 60 thinking.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40323-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we need to then separate that out so
we can do paint and and prep at a</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40323-1
<v Ricky Horton>different rate and that's the hard part.
We need adjusted.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40323-2
<v Ricky Horton>So like this chef TSMC job.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40326-0
<v Ricky Horton>Um, we went in at like.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40348-0
<v Ricky Horton>40 sometimes so that our after mark up
towards 65 because they will not budge</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40348-1
<v Ricky Horton>from that number.
So technically I think our actual.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40380-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's actionable cost plus markups,
overheads, consumables,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40380-1
<v Ricky Horton>everything that rolls into it.
I think it's between 46 and $49,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40380-2
<v Ricky Horton>but then markup. So it's cost up here.
It's just costly.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40381-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40420-0
<v Ricky Horton>Right.
And and it is the changes and then we'd</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40420-1
<v Ricky Horton>like there's times where we get approved
to to buy down our our shop rate that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40420-2
<v Ricky Horton>we're selling and increase our margins or
there's times where we decrease our</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40420-3
<v Ricky Horton>margins and keep our shop rate the same.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40441-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really. I'm used to this. Cost is cost.
I've never heard of anybody changing</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40441-1
<v Ricky Horton>shoppers. Me neither.
That's up for the year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40442-0
<v Ricky Horton>Oh.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40462-0
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to ask that question. Yeah,
Jeff would do that on on some of our jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40462-1
<v Ricky Horton>That is,
that's definitely that's not his way of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40462-2
<v Ricky Horton>operating. That's problem about him.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40504-0
<v Ricky Horton>We're both from the issue.
This is where it just the cost is that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40504-1
<v Ricky Horton>now usually has our overhead into it.
Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40504-2
<v Ricky Horton>and they're so they're trying to separate
that out into separate line items and new</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40504-3
<v Ricky Horton>estimated software they're doing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40533-0
<v Ricky Horton>So we're allowed to go lower,
especially in procore to put a lower cost</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40533-1
<v Ricky Horton>if we account for that,
if we put an incentive of item for admin</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40533-2
<v Ricky Horton>for all the other stuff, lines for admin,
lines for management, lines for.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40553-0
<v Ricky Horton>Why not? Probably. Probably.
I guess we're trying to take the cost of</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40553-1
<v Ricky Horton>part different consolid.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40559-0
<v Ricky Horton>It lets you be you're not charging.
You're not charging.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40589-0
<v Ricky Horton>I'm not saying the difference between
what let's say bid to when they got our</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40589-1
<v Ricky Horton>actual cost for a craft.
The difference between those two prices</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40589-2
<v Ricky Horton>doesn't essentially cover everything.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40594-0
<v Ricky Horton>Or along with one scale, that makes sense,
but.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40602-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you you got 135,000,
130 hours public labor.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40614-0
<v Ricky Horton>Our actual cost to save support,
it's at 55, so that 15 by 135.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40654-0
<v Ricky Horton>Whatever number it gives you,
it may be much more than it would be for</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40654-1
<v Ricky Horton>that. Some companies do.
They have their base rates and they have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40654-2
<v Ricky Horton>a indirect rate, they have a direct rate,
no direct overhead rates,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40654-3
<v Ricky Horton>and then they have a more go after that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-0
<v Ricky Horton>But it should be pretty much universal
across the company, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-1
<v Ricky Horton>No matter how how they're going to do it,
those three rates, the rate, interaction,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-2
<v Ricky Horton>the direct,
they should all be the same and not</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-3
<v Ricky Horton>change.
And then what should change is the market</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-4
<v Ricky Horton>idea, right? And that's way, yeah.
So we don't even look at the market.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40700-5
<v Ricky Horton>It's the same thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40736-0
<v Ricky Horton>And we work with the margin. Yeah,
it's just a little different,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40736-1
<v Ricky Horton>but you're trying to get to your true
manufacturing cost.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40736-2
<v Ricky Horton>The manufacturing cost is broken out into
those buckets that you just described.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40741-0
<v Ricky Horton>They've got the cost in.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40769-0
<v Ricky Horton>You freak it out.
Are you still covering all this?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40769-1
<v Ricky Horton>Is this one wrong or is this one wrong?
Yes, but to put it simply,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40769-2
<v Ricky Horton>so we have K we just submitted the
proport was 5.2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40788-0
<v Ricky Horton>They copied the exact wines in the man
Allison in Connecticut,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40788-1
<v Ricky Horton>didn't learn by this and there was a
development because it was a substantial</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40788-2
<v Ricky Horton>will.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40815-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because of the difference in labour,
that all got targeted at some of some</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40815-1
<v Ricky Horton>other stuff that you directed and
directed. Yes, and if we.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40824-0
<v Ricky Horton>At the same time in that job,
we already had $200,000, 200,000 Atlanta.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40846-0
<v Ricky Horton>Got it. I I understand. Yeah,
I get what's happening here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40846-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's because you're switching systems and
things are in different buckets. Yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40846-2
<v Ricky Horton>they didn't like double dip.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40892-0
<v Ricky Horton>They have to look at it. You can't,
you know, right. Use this program,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40892-1
<v Ricky Horton>all of these things.
They ought to be hard fast for like an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40892-2
<v Ricky Horton>entire year.
And then you look back at the last year</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40892-3
<v Ricky Horton>and say, OK,
do we need to adjust the rates for the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40892-4
<v Ricky Horton>next year?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40926-0
<v Ricky Horton>And they put a little bit of flop in
there to cover any increase in inflate</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40926-1
<v Ricky Horton>costs over the following year.
You're usually smart people do it at the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40926-2
<v Ricky Horton>end of the third quarter. Yeah.
So that by the time that your estimates</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40926-3
<v Ricky Horton>start hitting the ground in the first
quarter,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40926-4
<v Ricky Horton>it's already picked up everything that's
estimated in the 4th.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40927-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40962-0
<v Ricky Horton>So do we need to do a different, right?
Can we give,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40962-1
<v Ricky Horton>can we give the operations in the 55 and
with the shop of 65,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40962-2
<v Ricky Horton>you would have to go to 60?
What's your real cost?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40991-0
<v Ricky Horton>Surely don't burden,
but you're real directed and real cost.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40991-1
<v Ricky Horton>Thank you. Yeah,
that's not going to be by this,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40991-2
<v Ricky Horton>by this group,
by use of the benefit accounting to know</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/40991-3
<v Ricky Horton>as the leadership.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41020-0
<v Ricky Horton>Personally, yeah,
that's part of my question.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41020-1
<v Ricky Horton>If here's how that's that's two years in
the main is that that kind of job for me</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41020-2
<v Ricky Horton>to see how I want to see how we're doing
this. Yeah, you tell me. But yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41020-3
<v Ricky Horton>it has to be supplied basically every
product.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41052-0
<v Ricky Horton>Huh. What's that?
A rate on 15 type of code.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41052-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's a rate that shouts. So I'm not sure.
So there's a there's a rate that includes</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41052-2
<v Ricky Horton>and then there's a rate another you want
that like even when you both are being</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41052-3
<v Ricky Horton>right. OK, like that's great. That's a.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well,
that committee doesn't know the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-1
<v Ricky Horton>scientists time.
So they know who's considered to overhead.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-2
<v Ricky Horton>It says non human rights.
So non productive labor is overhead.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-3
<v Ricky Horton>So we got to calculate all that and the
environment that we have to take jobs in</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-4
<v Ricky Horton>all jobs a year and say OK,
this much percentage is to go overhead,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41094-5
<v Ricky Horton>right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41129-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then you got the other directive and
direct cost,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41129-1
<v Ricky Horton>insurance costs and cost of the building,
cost of the electric and all that,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41129-2
<v Ricky Horton>you know, so all those and it's like, OK,
here's our rates for next year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41129-3
<v Ricky Horton>Let's start.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41159-0
<v Ricky Horton>I resumed now so that we can just apply
to the right thing in October.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41159-1
<v Ricky Horton>It would be any jobs we get now they'll
be covered for January.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41159-2
<v Ricky Horton>So I think that's that's what I was. Yeah,
exactly the same. Sure, right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41159-3
<v Ricky Horton>That calculation assumes that you're
going to work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41202-0
<v Ricky Horton>All those man hours, the whole years,
it's a you're running, you're right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41202-1
<v Ricky Horton>you have to look at like the last three
years, for example, say on average,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41202-2
<v Ricky Horton>how many hours did we work over the last
few years? OK,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41202-3
<v Ricky Horton>do we think we're going to do that?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41237-0
<v Ricky Horton>That over the next year and that's what
we base those things on. Yeah. So it's up.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41237-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's a huge problem. Yeah, so, so,
but that's not us here for that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41237-2
<v Ricky Horton>That's at the beginning of this year.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41267-0
<v Ricky Horton>I think Mark's team is shrunk in half,
so the total hour is not by half and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41267-1
<v Ricky Horton>you're still not the same.
I understand with Mark's team, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41267-2
<v Ricky Horton>you've got to. So that's put up in public.
So yeah, you're right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41267-3
<v Ricky Horton>it would be a drastic.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41296-0
<v Ricky Horton>Drastic,
drastic increase in overhead that that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41296-1
<v Ricky Horton>the other guys they haven't done that.
I don't think Greg, you're right.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41296-2
<v Ricky Horton>So you haven't done that.
I would say it's making, you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41296-3
<v Ricky Horton>every company, everybody does.
That's how it's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41340-0
<v Ricky Horton>We'll get more money on the jobs if not a
truck that'll get or you it's more money</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41340-1
<v Ricky Horton>in your bottom line if we have big jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41369-0
<v Ricky Horton>We would cover the program.
We we don't start numbers in our own</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41369-1
<v Ricky Horton>county. That's something.
That's why I asked that question.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41369-2
<v Ricky Horton>I just wanted to know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41379-0
<v Ricky Horton>Based on it,
whatever numbers that the county comes up</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41379-1
<v Ricky Horton>with, needs to be input into the system.
We're gonna estimate.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41396-0
<v Ricky Horton>I used to do it, so yes, I catch it.
It's not a conversation for this program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41396-1
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41419-0
<v Ricky Horton>Yeah, I don't plan. So I did. I was like,
I'm going to know exactly what the same</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41419-1
<v Ricky Horton>thing I was doing. Yeah,
because that was be explained a little.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41419-2
<v Ricky Horton>I didn't even sit there for 35 years.
That goes pretty well.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41439-0
<v Ricky Horton>So that's that's, you know,
I don't think so. I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41439-1
<v Ricky Horton>So probably we're going to kind of work
for start, finish.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41470-0
<v Ricky Horton>Tomorrow we will have for just the
integration discussion.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41470-1
<v Ricky Horton>We have a line up so we can take it with
the text.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41470-2
<v Ricky Horton>I don't want to see what we can do with
that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41484-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's a pretty.
I think it's the other program.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41484-1
<v Ricky Horton>They're heavy builder.
I have to have the right thing.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41484-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're going to come up with electrical
components,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41484-3
<v Ricky Horton>special topics provided that I can.
I think it's quite a while because I just</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41484-4
<v Ricky Horton>call that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41516-0
<v Ricky Horton>How do you get access?
You just ask the question and get an</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41516-1
<v Ricky Horton>answer.
All they have is the numbers to plug into</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41516-2
<v Ricky Horton>the program. That's all.
I think that's that's not our fault after</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41516-3
<v Ricky Horton>that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41544-0
<v Ricky Horton>They don't need enough work if they get
enough work. That's not not the issues.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41544-1
<v Ricky Horton>It's like what number do you want to use?
That's what we're putting. If you want,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41544-2
<v Ricky Horton>it's called pro forma,
which is kind of how you model, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41545-0
<v Ricky Horton>Like we are.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41557-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then let's see.
So we we readjust the rates, yeah,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41557-1
<v Ricky Horton>to match 75% efficiency.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41573-0
<v Ricky Horton>No. OK. So we we got to do that. Yeah,
you didn't do that. No, Taylor,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41573-1
<v Ricky Horton>put that as an extra, so.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41612-0
<v Ricky Horton>If you run it,
if you run a shop through both Fab and</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41612-1
<v Ricky Horton>Stoney's,
do you want to and you set it to 75,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41612-2
<v Ricky Horton>but that's what works for Fab.
And his numbers are you're right,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41612-3
<v Ricky Horton>you're absolutely. Yeah, you go,
the question is do you want to put the</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41612-4
<v Ricky Horton>efficiency on 100% and see where it then
you got to change all the shop stuff.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41650-0
<v Ricky Horton>Shot up right now.
Let me ask you a question because this is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41650-1
<v Ricky Horton>something I'm not.
If we want to schedule at a certain</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41650-2
<v Ricky Horton>efficiency rate,
what should we be estimated by?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41650-3
<v Ricky Horton>Should it be the same or you always want
to cover a worst case scenario?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41683-0
<v Ricky Horton>Estimating right?
It's like you're never according to you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41683-1
<v Ricky Horton>guys yesterday.
All your **** comes out exactly where</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41683-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're I don't believe, frankly,
but normally you're going to want it</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41683-3
<v Ricky Horton>slightly higher than what you think your
cost is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41723-0
<v Ricky Horton>So yeah, maybe 75% not the right one.
Maybe 90% is I don't know.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41723-1
<v Ricky Horton>I don't know if this could be the company
here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41723-2
<v Ricky Horton>I would actually see three years worth of
how many hours are estimated versus how</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41723-3
<v Ricky Horton>many hours you've actually hit.
Then I'd be almost at 90%. Shut up,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41723-4
<v Ricky Horton>I don't believe that. I don't believe.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41754-0
<v Ricky Horton>No, it will match up to his payroll. Yeah,
especially matching up the payroll,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41754-1
<v Ricky Horton>because at that point, well, really, no,
we can look down with that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41754-2
<v Ricky Horton>That is actual, right?
So somebody's got to get actual for like</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41754-3
<v Ricky Horton>a three-year period and say yes, look.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41796-0
<v Ricky Horton>Based on the estimate and the actuals,
here's what the difference is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41796-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's how you adjust your your 75% or
whatever percent you're going to use,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41796-2
<v Ricky Horton>because like, look,
we're not that accurate. We you know,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41796-3
<v Ricky Horton>we have guys that would go to internal
jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41829-0
<v Ricky Horton>They wanted to put their time in the tops
because they were trying to match the out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41829-1
<v Ricky Horton>No, it should be estimating. Hey,
we're out of hours.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41829-2
<v Ricky Horton>Nobody's then they went, nobody's 100%.
That's enough. So it's not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41829-3
<v Ricky Horton>Same thing with painters.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41858-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you generally say yourself,
I think here's what the slowest turn out</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41858-1
<v Ricky Horton>or just 10 out, right. So let's call that,
OK, keep me up. OK.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41858-2
<v Ricky Horton>But then we can maybe have to get it on
the 20, then we're really 100%.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41868-0
<v Ricky Horton>But that is, that number is more straight,
you know, on all of that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41868-1
<v Ricky Horton>And that's some reason without that,
as it is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41868-2
<v Ricky Horton>you're on the first job as the second job.
So that's not going to be any payable,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41868-3
<v Ricky Horton>that's going to be on 80%.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41900-0
<v Ricky Horton>It made it look really perfect.
That's the same.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41900-1
<v Ricky Horton>So you made more and part of the problem
with this is estimating the value of G</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41900-2
<v Ricky Horton>and that part again. That's it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41947-0
<v Ricky Horton>All of our time in the shop in 10 of the
last year or two have been us calibrating</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41947-1
<v Ricky Horton>the numbers. OK, so is it any of our.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/41981-0
<v Ricky Horton>85%, I don't believe it.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42016-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would be an existing.
I mean it would never been something that</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42016-1
<v Ricky Horton>we've ever adjusted as as as part of the
issue.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42016-2
<v Ricky Horton>So he's only interested in what we've
never made in the past.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42016-3
<v Ricky Horton>So it's never made an adjustment.
I've found that elector. I'll on Thursday,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42016-4
<v Ricky Horton>oh, hey, we don't understand.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42038-0
<v Ricky Horton>And then instead of decreasing their
efficiencies, percentage,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42038-1
<v Ricky Horton>it's been fine-tuned to work 75%. OK,
and that's why we need to move away.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42038-2
<v Ricky Horton>We're actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42058-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's something by our system can
actually work. Plus they're going to be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42058-1
<v Ricky Horton>They should dial it in to.
I'll give them back one as my day at $2.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42058-2
<v Ricky Horton>00 left over. OK, the thing,
the thing I like the road there when</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42058-3
<v Ricky Horton>we're working with this study.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42083-0
<v Ricky Horton>I have a lot of.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42107-0
<v Ricky Horton>Well, that's the hard part. 10 minutes.
So you have to determine that's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42107-1
<v Ricky Horton>percentage. Yeah,
it's actually working on license.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42107-2
<v Ricky Horton>What do you have that's important to
adjustments? I would be.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42128-0
<v Ricky Horton>It has to be looking up and they don't
want to look at it and Michelle goes</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42128-1
<v Ricky Horton>responsible on that issue.
It does not go for jobs. They work,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42128-2
<v Ricky Horton>they say guys,
I know you don't want to do that.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42128-3
<v Ricky Horton>We have really good employees at that.
So you need to have a good.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42164-0
<v Ricky Horton>Do you still run out of work on the shop
and clean it up and do whatever they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42164-1
<v Ricky Horton>not putting the morning tell us they
might steal your time and what they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42164-2
<v Ricky Horton>doing here is they're actually posting
that 900 jobs.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42164-3
<v Ricky Horton>Are we going to raise the electrical guys
in or we're going to make sure that this</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42164-4
<v Ricky Horton>is actually.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42174-0
<v Ricky Horton>Because they they're efficient of your.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42229-0
<v Ricky Horton>You're cheating yourself if you don't
know what that's how it's done.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42229-1
<v Ricky Horton>So your time studies are ******** is what
you're talking about because your time</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42229-2
<v Ricky Horton>studies,
the time studies you're doing now are</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42229-3
<v Ricky Horton>good, but if you look at a past job,
if you look at histories.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42284-0
<v Ricky Horton>And you're going to get a time set.
Now let's say I have a job in two years</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42284-1
<v Ricky Horton>ago,
just like when I was starting tomorrow,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42284-2
<v Ricky Horton>two years ago, look at that job and say,
wow, look, we the manage the hours,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42284-3
<v Ricky Horton>it was, we had this, we beat those hours.
I can do that same thing here.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42284-4
<v Ricky Horton>That's ********. We didn't do it.
We beat those hours over here, right?</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42306-0
<v Ricky Horton>That's why it's not right.
So it's like you should.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42306-1
<v Ricky Horton>That's what the whole efficiency is about.
It should be put down as an efficiency</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42306-2
<v Ricky Horton>background. I understand.
I'm wondering how another house,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42306-3
<v Ricky Horton>I know they don't do that, but I'd see.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42311-0
<v Ricky Horton>Thanks a lot. What he's saying is.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42352-0
<v Ricky Horton>As long as you're capturing the real
hours, yeah, that's the key.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42352-1
<v Ricky Horton>Capturing the real hours,
ignore this real hours. So the problem is,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42352-2
<v Ricky Horton>is that it's retention and if we don't
have enough hours to pay other people,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42352-3
<v Ricky Horton>they won't stay in the league.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42382-0
<v Ricky Horton>And that's as you slow down,
that becomes a real issue.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42382-1
<v Ricky Horton>There's an issue everywhere.
The most efficient shops have to have</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42382-2
<v Ricky Horton>piles of work outside.
If you don't have piles of work,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42382-3
<v Ricky Horton>everything gets less efficient. That's.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42384-0
<v Ricky Horton>Human nature, yeah.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42429-0
<v Ricky Horton>What he's saying,
so we got to get cheaper to get more work.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42429-1
<v Ricky Horton>So the short answer is when we have the
discussion we have about why there's</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42429-2
<v Ricky Horton>hours you're meeting,
the reason they are is because if they're</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42429-3
<v Ricky Horton>meeting hours on the job and rather than
send guys home,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42429-4
<v Ricky Horton>they're still posting hours to the job
even though they're not.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42471-0
<v Ricky Horton>It would be good in my opinion.
All the other I've worked at is like, no,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42471-1
<v Ricky Horton>those go down is overhead.
If you're going to keep them because you</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42471-2
<v Ricky Horton>got to keep them because you keep the
good guys,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42471-3
<v Ricky Horton>you got to have some do something else if
they're not another.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42495-0
<v Ricky Horton>Have an overhead button just for that and
just just to save the data.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42495-1
<v Ricky Horton>You'll freak out over this,
but I'll have you if I do a shot that is</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42495-2
<v Ricky Horton>tracking down.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42538-0
<v Ricky Horton>Really.
That was the last time I get stuck did</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42538-1
<v Ricky Horton>not track up like for 35 weeks until I
got here seven months ago.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42538-2
<v Ricky Horton>When they walked in the door,
they wanted in and when they walked out,</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42538-3
<v Ricky Horton>it was like they wanted out.</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42554-0
<v Ricky Horton>So you know what they're getting, Yeah.
But if you look at the time they've long</v>
a7f4ffbc-97f5-4965-8fac-7fcc01171c89/42554-1
<v Ricky Horton>time, like 40% of the hours we're missing.</v>
